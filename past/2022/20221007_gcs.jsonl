Airports and communities court these new services.\n\nThere are dozens of changes to airline routes each month. Here's a look at some of the most interesting:\n\nUnited 'maximizing' routes at Newark, Washington hubs\n\nUnited Airlines announced changes to about two dozen routes as it adjusts schedules at its main East Coast hubs in New York and Washington. United described the move as one that would allow it to \"maximize\" operations at those locations.\n\nAt its hub at New Jersey's Newark Liberty, United will add additional flights on 15 routes it already flies from there. Newark is one of the three major airports serving metro New York City. United also will add a new seasonal route from Newark to Palm Springs, Calif., and will transition its Newark-Key West, Fla., service from seasonal to year-round.\n\nAs it does that, United will make room in its schedule at Newark — which is capacity controlled — by shifting three routes to its hub at Washington Dulles and by dropping four others to cities United already serves from other cities.\n\nThe three cities that will see their United service switch to Washington from Newark are Chattanooga, Tenn.; Ithaca, N.Y.; and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pa. The four cities losing non-stop Newark service will be Baltimore; Des Moines, Iowa; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and Hartford, Conn. United will still serve all four of those destinations from other hubs.\n\n“The schedule adjustments are designed to offer more non-stop flights to destinations popular with New York area customers while reallocating largely connecting passenger flights on short-haul routes to United’s hub at Washington-Dulles,” United said in a statement explaining the changes.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The fleet and hubs of United Airlines (story continues below)\n\nAmerican: Less China, more Caribbean\n\nAmerican Airlines rolled out a wide-ranging set of route adjustments that will see the carrier bolster service to Hawaii and the Caribbean and suspend a major route to China.\n\nThe changes bring new Caribbean routes to four of American’s hubs, including four from Chicago O’Hare (Aruba; Cayman Islands; Nassau, Bahamas; and Turks and Caicos) and two from Charlotte (Eleuthera and Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas). Miami and Dallas/Fort Worth (Aruba) each get one new Caribbean route, though Miami’s is the only one that introduces a new destination to American’s route map: St. Vincent and the Grenadines. American says that Saturday-only route will make it the only U.S. carrier to fly to the Caribbean island nation, which opened a new airport in 2017.\n\nAdditionally, Chicago O’Hare will gain a seasonal wintertime route to Honolulu, which American plans to fly with Boeing 787-8 “Dreamliner” widebody jets. That daily service will launch Dec. 19, restoring a route American last flew in 2014.\n\nAmerican also revealed plans to suspend its high-profile service between Chicago O’Hare and Beijing in October. The last Beijing-bound flight will depart Chicago on Oct. 20 with the return leaving China for Chicago on Oct. 22.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The fleet and hubs of American Airlines (story continues below)\n\nSan Antonio becomes a Frontier town\n\nFrontier Airlines announced a major expansion in San Antonio, where the ultra-low-cost carrier will add nine new routes to its existing schedule.\n\nOnce the flights begin, Frontier will offer either seasonal or year-round service from San Antonio to 23 destinations. That, Frontier says, will make it the top carrier there as measured by number of non-stop routes offered.\n\nFrontier’s newest San Antonio routes are: Albuquerque, N.M.; Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio; Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; and Tulsa, Okla.\n\nFrontier will be the only airline to fly on eight of those. Its new Charlotte-San Antonio service will face direct competition from American, which counts Charlotte as one of its hub cities.\n\nIN PICTURES: Frontier Airlines debuts at Washington Dulles (story continues below)\n\nAllegiant says 'so long' to Trenton, Colorado Springs\n\nThere are now two fewer dots on Allegiant’s route map.\n\nAllegiant ended service to Colorado Springs, Colo., and Trenton, N.J., in late April, ending all of its flights from both cities.\n\nAllegiant spokeswoman Krysta Levy cited “a lack of demand” for Allegiant’s decision to leave both markets.\n\nAllegiant had flown from Colorado Springs since 1999, though it was down to just one route — Las Vegas — when it ended service April 29. Allegiant’s Trenton service began two years ago, when it launched three Florida routes in late 2016. After dropping its last route to Punta Gorda, the Trenton-Mercer Airport is left with just one passenger airline: Frontier.\n\nEven with the loss of Trenton and Colorado Springs, Allegiant will serve 118 U.S. cities. That includes Allegiant's previously announced new service to Nashville, Tenn., that's set to begin June 7.\n\nFrench Bee lands in San Francisco\n\nOne of the newest European low-cost carriers to try the U.S., French Bee — formerly known as French Blue — launched flights on May 11 from its first U.S. city: San Francisco.\n\nIt now offers flights to both Paris Orly and the South Pacific destination of Tahiti, serving both routes with new Airbus A350-900 aircraft that include 35 “Premium” recliner seats and 376 in coach.\n\nFrench Bee has advertised fares as low as $189 one-way on the San Francisco-Paris leg route and as low as $330 one-way between San Francisco and Tahiti, though the carrier’s cheapest fares come with fees for items such as checked bags and advance seat assignments.\n\nFrench Bee will face competition on both routes. Air France, United and French leisure carrier XL Airways also fly non-stop to Paris. And United — which operates one of its busiest hubs at San Francisco — will launch its own San Francisco-Tahiti service in October.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: U.S. airports with budget airline flights to Europe (story continues below)\n\nHawaii: More updates from Southwest\n\nSouthwest’s plan for its new Hawaii service is slowly falling into place.\n\nThe airline revealed this month that it intends to begin Hawaii flights with service from four California cities: Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Jose.\n\nThe details are the latest of a drawn-out trickle of announcements about Southwest’s long-anticipated launch of service to the state. The carrier first announced its intent to fly to Hawaii in 2017, though it has yet to set a start date as it awaits certification to fly its Boeing 737s on the long overwater routes between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland.\n\nIn April, Southwest confirmed that it intends to eventually serve four airports in Hawaii: Honolulu (island of Oahu), Kahului (Maui), Lihue (Kauai) and Kona (Hawaii's “Big Island\").\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/10/coronavirus-new-jersey-timeline-events-covid-covid-19/4964918002/", "title": "Coronavirus in New Jersey: A timeline of events from first cases to ...", "text": "Editor's note: This file will be updated frequently.\n\nNew Jersey has been on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak since January, when Newark Liberty International Airport became a major screening and quarantine station for foreign travelers, to March, when the first New Jerseyans were diagnosed with the disease.\n\nHere is a timeline of events based on news reports and information from the state Department of Health.\n\nMarch 4\n\nJames Cai, a 32-year-old New York physician assistant with an apartment in Fort Lee, is the first person in New Jersey to be diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nCai developed symptoms of COVID-19 on March 1, went to an urgent care facility and was eventually admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center.\n\nCai had not traveled to countries where the virus is spreading, and has no school-aged children. He said he had recently attended a medical conference in Times Square.\n\nAfter 19 days in the hospital, Cai is eventually released and is recovering at home but still on oxygen because of the lung damage inflicted by the virus. He says that once he is fully recovered, he wants to get back to work and help treat patients.\n\nMarch 5\n\nAn Englewood woman becomes the second New Jerseyan to test positive for coronavirus.

He was hospitalized at Englewood Health since March 5. The man had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also attended the conference, but conference officials said the Englewood man did not interact with Trump or Pence.\n\nSeveral lawmakers, including Sen Ted Cruz, R-Texas, later said they would self-quarantine out of precaution because they attended the CPAC conference.\n\nMarch 8\n\nState officials announce New Jersey's fifth and sixth residents to test positive for coronavirus.\n\nOne is a 70-year-old Teaneck man whose symptoms began on Feb. 28.

Phil Murphy declares a state of emergency after five additional residents are diagnosed with the disease, bringing the statewide total to 11.\n\nThe declaration allows state government to deploy resources more quickly by waiving a number of bureaucratic requirements like the bidding process for medical supplies.\n\nMurphy says the action is necessary \"to ensure that local health agencies on the front lines of the state's response are equipped with the resources needed to further prepare our health care system for a broader spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe disease has now been detected in five counties with Bergen having the most: 5.\n\nThe new cases included:\n\nAn 18-year-old woman from Clifton, who is hospitalized.

It called for airlines to automatically refund the fees when a passenger’s luggage arrives at least 12 hours after a domestic flight. Airlines collected nearly $4.2 billion in bag fees that year.\n\nThe law left it to the Transportation Department (DOT) to work out and finalize the details by July 2017.\n\nThe refund regulation is among a handful of consumer-oriented proposals at the department that were delayed, postponed or withdrawn in the year since President Trump took office.\n\nTrump ordered a regulatory freeze on Jan. 20, 2017, his first day in office. At the time, Trump's first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the agencies needed time to review new or pending regulations. Ten days later, Trump signed an executive order requiring any new regulation to trigger the repeal of two existing regulations. The next month, he ordered every federal department to recommend which regulations to repeal or modify.\n\nLast month, Trump boasted of canceling or delaying more than 1,500 planned regulatory actions — \"more than any previous president by far.”\n\n“The never-ending growth of red tape in America has come to a sudden screeching and beautiful halt,” he said.\n\nCritics say Trump threw out consumer protections along with the red tape.\n\n\"Consumers already know that airlines will stop at nothing — from exorbitant bag fees to shrinking seat sizes — to turn a profit,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"Now, they are faced with an administration apparently anxious and eager to aid the airlines’ anti-consumer assault.\"\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, says the bag rule is a clear-cut consumer protection.\n\n\"If people have to pay to have their bag accompany them on a flight and the airline can’t deliver that bag within 12 hours, there was no service rendered. They should get a refund,\" DeFazio said.\n\nDeFazio says the delays in such protections are deliberate. \"Obviously that would cost the airlines some money, so hence the administration has delayed it,\" he said.\n\nThe department continues to evaluate comments about how to define a delay and the best method for providing a refund. A cost-benefit analysis must still be completed, before the regulation is finalized.\n\nLee Page, a spokesman for Paralyzed Veterans of America, worried that the delays stem from Trump’s insistence on removing two rules for every one created.\n\n“Agencies put out rules and regulations for reasons, to safeguard the industry and safeguard consumers, to ensure the general public that things can go forward on a level playing field,” Page said. “But if you look across the board, there are lots of agencies not putting out rules. This is kind of the new norm.”\n\nBesides late-bag refunds, other aviation proposals in limbo include:\n\n•Reporting how many wheelchairs airlines damage in cargo. The department postponed a “final rule” from late in the Obama administration until Jan. 1, 2019. The one-year delay, which is being challenged in federal court, gave airlines more time to begin reporting. The rule was first proposed in 2011.\n\n•Providing disabled passengers easier access to lavatories on single-aisle planes. Tight cabins often prohibit access to lavatories for passengers with wheelchairs. Airlines and advocates negotiated a broad compromise in 2016 to make accessible lavatories in new planes. But the department missed a July 2017 deadline set by Congress to propose a detailed regulation.\n\n•Limiting the types of emotional support animals allowed on planes. The variety of comfort animals has grown to include monkeys, pigs and ducks. The department missed the same July 2017 deadline to set new rules for the animals. Delta Air Lines drafted its own policy released Friday rather than wait for federal regulations.\n\n•Notifying passengers when an airline allows voice calls during flight. The Federal Communications Commission prohibits cellphone calls on planes, but Wi-Fi calls such as Skype prompted the department to propose the notification in December 2016. The subject has drawn 8,300 comments over the past three years. The comment period ended in March 2017. No further action has been taken.\n\n•Requiring airlines to provide fare information to all travel websites for easier comparison shopping. The request generated 56,000 comments. But the department stopped collecting comments indefinitely in March 2017.\n\n• Requiring airlines to disclose bag fees alongside the ticket price so consumers can easily factor those costs into their purchase decision. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao withdrew this proposal in December, saying no action was needed.\n\n•Reporting the total airline fees charged for 19 services, including priority check-in, in-flight entertainment, food and seat assignments. The department already collects the total charges for checked bags and change fees, which totaled nearly $2.9 billion in 2016. But Chao withdrew the broader proposal in December by saying it wouldn’t help consumers understand specific fees. The industry had argued providing such information was too burdensome.\n\nAirlines, advocates agree, but DOT still delays\n\nIn some cases, the parties to the regulations have already reached a consensus and are simply waiting for DOT to sign off.\n\nA panel of airline industry representatives, experts and disability advocates convened by DOT negotiated for months in 2016 to improve accessibility for disabled passengers. Airlines agreed to develop better maneuverability for their wheelchairs in the cabin, and in the development of future aircraft to provide accessible lavatories on single-aisle planes. The department agreed to develop formal regulations by July 2017, but missed the deadline.\n\nWithout the improvements, Page, the spokesman for paralyzed veterans, said people who use wheelchairs often dehydrate themselves the night before a flight so they won't have to use a restroom.\n\n“What we’re told right now is to go to the bathroom before you get on the plane and just hold it,\" he said. \"No other person has to do that.\"\n\nNow negotiators worry that the seven months of talks could be wasted.\n\n“The longer something sits, the more likely that we could hear in the future that it’s forgotten or it’s become stale,” said Heather Ansley, associate general counsel for Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n\nThe Paralyzed Veterans group sued the Transportation Department in federal court on behalf of Air Force veteran Larry Dodson of North Augusta, S.C., who has used a wheelchair for 43 years, over a postponed regulation that requires airlines to report to the department how many wheelchairs are damaged in flight. The case is on appeal.\n\nDodson, 70, said airlines have repeatedly damaged his wheelchair.\n\n“If they’re damaged, if they’re destroyed, if they’re delayed, if they’re broken, it’s tantamount to us not having our legs when we get to where we’re going,” said Dodson, who planned a flight Saturday to San Diego with a wheelchair still damaged from a previous flight. “The delays are hurting us.”\n\nThe department hasn’t argued the merits of the case yet. But the department said the delay would allow airlines more time to distinguish wheelchairs from other mishandled bags that are already reported monthly.\n\nAirlines are using the time to resolve technical challenges in reporting damaged wheelchairs separate from mishandled bags, according to Alison McAfee, spokeswoman for Airlines for America, a trade group representing most of the largest carriers.\n\n“U.S. airlines remain committed to offering a high level of customer service and routinely go above and beyond to provide a pleasant flight experience for all of our passengers, especially those in need of additional assistance,” she said.\n\nWithholding fares from sites like Kayak\n\nIn October 2016, the department asked for help sorting out whether airlines withholding fares from online comparison sites is unfair to travelers shopping for tickets. Tens of thousands of comments poured in and the department suspended comment while it considers its next step.\n\nAirlines routinely restrict some fares from being passed along to comparison sites such as TripAdvisor or Kayak, according to Steve Shur, president of the Travel Technology Association.\n\n“They’re picking and choosing winners and losers,” Shur said. “We’re just saying that consumers are harmed when they don’t have access to information, when the only place they can find the information is on the airline’s own website, where they are no longer in a competitive environment.”\n\nBut Congress deregulated the industry in 1978, and airlines contend they should be allowed to market fares however they want. Average domestic fares of $336 hit a 23-year low in the third quarter of 2017 when adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\n“Right now fares are historically low, competition is robust and customers are benefiting from more choices and better service when they fly,” McAfee said. “It would be difficult to find an industry that is more transparent than the airlines, as all pricing information is readily available to travelers at the click of a button and customers always know the full price of their ticket before purchase.”\n\nThe department relaunched its consumer website last year to ensure airlines follow rules and consumers know their rights — and how to file a complaint. The department’s Aviation Consumer Protection Division made 100 unannounced inspections of 34 airlines at 19 airports last year to ensure airline workers are complying with consumer rules and civil-rights laws.\n\nAirlines for America commended Chao for \"ushering in a new era of smarter regulation focusing on jobs and economic growth,\" McAfee said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-clarifications/1821023/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2020", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country.

The next day, with the approval of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, East Germany builds a wall that would extend 27 miles through Berlin, dividing families and friends for the next 28 years. The wall would serve as an enduring symbol of the Cold War, used by presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to inspire a divided city.\n\n1962: Cuban missile crisis\n\n• Date: Oct.16-28\n\n• Location: Multiple\n\nWhen the United States learns that the Soviet Union is building nuclear missile installations 90 miles south of Miami in communist Cuba, the Kennedy administration starts a naval blockade around the island, which is at times tested, and Kennedy demands the removal of the missiles.The standoff is widely considered to be the closest the two nuclear superpowers come to direct military confrontation. Cooler heads prevail. The Soviet Union offers to remove the missiles in exchange for a guarantee that the United States will not invade Cuba. In secret, the administration also agrees to withdraw U.S. missiles from Turkey.\n\n1963: JFK assassinated\n\n• Date: Nov. 22\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nAs John F.

But at the beginning of 1983, the the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) – a small network for academics and researchers – transitions to the standard TCP/IP protocol of the World Wide Web. The protocol would become the internet's cornerstone and technical foundation as it allows expanded available address space and decentralizes the network, thus also expanding accessibility.\n\n1984: Chemicals kill thousands in India\n\n• Date: Dec. 2\n\n• Location: Bhopal, India\n\nThe chemical disaster in Bhopal is still considered history's worst industrial disaster. About 30 tons of methyl isocyanate, an industrial gas used to make pesticide, are released at a Union Carbide Corp. plant. About 600,000 poor residents of nearby shanty towns are exposed to a highly toxic compound that kills about 15,000 people and countless farm animals, according to Indian government estimates. The calamity leads to a generation of birth defects. To this day, locals claim the now-abandoned site is riddled with toxic materials left behind by Union Carbide, which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 2001.\n\n1985: Reagan, Gorbachev meet\n\n• Date: Nov. 19\n\n• Location: Geneva\n\nDespite his often bellicose criticisms of the Soviet Union, Reagan agrees to meet with his counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Geneva in the first meeting between leaders of the two Cold War foes in nearly a decade.

The failure is later identified as a problem with the so-called O-rings used to form a seal in the seams of the shuttle's external fuel tanks.\n\n1987: Stock market tanks\n\n• Date: Oct. 19\n\n• Location: Worldwide\n\nOct. 19, 1987, is called Black Monday because on that day the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunges 508 points, or more than 22%. The drop is worse than the crash in 1929. It is also worse than the market plunge after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\nThe 50 hottest cities in America:Phoenix tops the list\n\n1988: When the U.S. armed Iran\n\n• Date: March 16\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nLt.

Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\nDetailed findings & methodology\n\nThere is little doubt that in the last 100 years, mankind has progressed dramatically. People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list.

Biden pardons\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday pardoned all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, a move that senior administration officials said would affect thousands of Americans charged with that crime. “No one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana,” Biden said in a video announcing his executive actions. As part of the announcement, Biden also encouraged governors to take similar steps to pardon those with state marijuana possession charges. The announcement comes a month ahead of critical November elections that will determine control of Congress and as Democrats seek to rebuff allegations that they are soft on crime, an issue that has risen to the top of some voters’ agendas in certain swing districts.\n\n2. Las Vegas stabbings\n\nA suspect is in custody after two people were killed and six others were wounded in a series of stabbings in front of Las Vegas casino on Thursday. The incident took place near the Wynn hotel and casino shortly before noon, police said. The 32-year old suspect was taken into custody on two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder with a deadly weapon. Authorities have not shared the suspect’s motive, but the stabbings appear to be unprovoked and without any altercation beforehand, police said. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said the victims were a combination of locals and tourists, and police will provide information on them after their families have been contacted.\n\n3. Iran\n\nThe US issued new sanctions Thursday on seven senior Iranian officials over the Iranian government’s violent crackdown on mass protests and restrictions on internet access in the country. For weeks, a protest movement in Iran’s capital of Tehran has gathered momentum since the death in mid-September of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman who died after being detained by the country’s morality police for apparently not wearing her hijab properly. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been detained in the demonstrations. CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of the dead and injured, but state media says 40 people have died since the start of protests in September. Human rights group Amnesty International says at least 52 have been killed.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Missing out on playing in World Cup is 'worth sacrificing for one strand of Iranian women's hair' 05:19 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Trump\n\nJustice Department officials are insisting to former President Donald Trump’s attorneys that he return any outstanding documents marked as classified, making it clear they do not believe he has returned all materials taken when he left the White House, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN. Whether the FBI rounded up all of the sensitive federal records in Trump’s possession during its search of his Mar-a-Lago residence is a question that’s loomed over the situation in recent weeks. But in numerous court filings, prosecutors indicated they had concerns that classified records were possibly still missing. Justice officials – including Jay Bratt, a top lawyer in the Department of Justice’s national security division – have communicated to Trump’s attorneys that he has an ongoing obligation to return the documents marked as classified.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump's impeachment lawyer weighs in on Trump's ongoing legal battles 04:37 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Amazon\n\nAmazon plans to hire 150,000 new workers in the US to meet demand ahead of the busy holiday shopping season, the company said Thursday. The openings – which include full-time, seasonal, and part-time roles – range from picking and packing to sorting and shipping. While Amazon typically opens new roles each holiday season, this large hiring spree comes in the heat of a tight labor market and as rising inflation continues to put more pressure on companies to raise wages. In response, Amazon said it would increase wages to $19 an hour based on the position, up from an average of $18 previously, and provide sign-on bonuses. Some of the states with the highest number of jobs available include California, Illinois and Texas.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Check out Amazon's new sleep tracker and Kindle you can write on 01:27 - Source: CNN\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nPet sitter is no match for rambunctious puppies\n\nWatch this dog sitter faceplant while trying to wrangle some adorable puppies.

Apple is rumored to be unveiling a series of new MacBooks and iMacs featuring the second iteration of its powerful in-house processor, as well as a 5G version of its more-affordable iPhone SE smartphone and an updated iPad Air.\n\nThe event invitations, sent to members of the press, come one day after Apple (AAPL) announced it would stop selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf the event’s tagline is any indication, Apple will likely play up the importance of its rumored M2 silicon chip. Apple’s in-house processor is expected to make its debut in a new 13-inch MacBook Pro, a Mac mini, a 24-inch Mac, and a completely redesigned MacBook Air, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\n\nApple launched its first in-house M1 silicon chipset for its computer lineup in November 2020, shifting away from years of using a one-size-fits-all option from Intel. The company claimed it was the world’s fastest CPU core and fastest integrated graphics in a personal computer. A year later, Apple introduced its M1 Pro and M1 Max processors to the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro line.\n\nWhile Apple typically launches its flagship iPhone devices in the fall, the rumor mill indicates it could launch its third iPhone SE following its initial release in 2017 and again in 2020. The device is expected to run on Apple’s faster A15 Bionic chip, features an updated camera and could drop the classic notch usually found at the top. The next-generation iPad Air is also said to be getting the same A15 processor, 5G connectivity and a new camera.\n\nIn January, Apple reported record revenue during the all-important holiday quarter fueled in part by demand for its latest lineup of iPhones.

But in typical Apple fashion, the tech giant was sparse on details as it builds up excitement and urges customers to tune in on the big day.\n\nThe event will kick off at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and CNN Business will carry live coverage of it. Here is a look at what to expect from CEO Tim Cook and his team.\n\nThe star of the show\n\nAs it has done every year for about a decade, Apple is widely expected to unveil its latest iPhone at the September keynote.\n\nApple is expected to go big with the iPhone 14 — literally. It’s rumored that it will debut a 6.7-inch phone that’s not a Pro model, meaning it will have the bigger screen size but without the higher price tag. The rumor mill also suggests that Apple might ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone in the 14 lineup so that they don’t compete with iPhone SE sales.\n\nA woman walks past an image of an iPhone 13 Pro at an Apple Store on the day the new Apple iPhone 13 series went on sale, in Beijing, China, on September 24, 2021. Garcia Rawlins/Reuters\n\nForecasts point to the latest Pro model being slightly slimmer, and the much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system to be absent in the new iPhone models.\n\nApple watchers are also getting excited about a potential major camera quality upgrade with the iPhone 14 — possibly one that can shoot 8K video. If this happens, it could be among the biggest changes to the iPhone’s camera quality to date.\n\nHow Apple will price the iPhone 14 is already shaping up to be a test, as broader economic conditions for both the tech sector and consumers have entered choppy waters. A handful of analysts have already forecast slight price hikes for the latest-and-greatest iPhone model. “My expectation is that Apple will probably have to nudge prices up,” Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, told CNN Business ahead of the event.\n\nCurrently, the regular, non-mini iPhone 13 starts at $799, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099. Some analysts are predicting a $100 price hike on at least the higher-end Pro and Pro Max models. But given the strain consumers are facing, he thinks Apple will also do “everything they can to make that as minimal as possible.” This could mean offering attractive trade-in bonuses, payment installment plans, and other offers.\n\nDespite rising inflation and other economic headwinds, Cook said in the company’s most recent earnings call that there has been “no obvious evidence” of macroeconomic impact on iPhone sales yet. This doesn’t mean the tech giant is immune to a worsening economic climate. It reported a nearly 11% decline in profits during the three months ending in June, compared to the same period a year ago. This event also comes amid supply chain hiccups linked to China’s zero-Covid policy.\n\nCustomers walk past a digital display of an Apple iPhone 13 pro inside the Apple Store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, in New York City, on March 18.\n\nFinally, there has been some chatter that Apple could remove the iPhone’s Lightning port in new models and opt for a design with charging via wireless MagSafe. There have also been rumors that some US models may launch without a physical SIM slot, as Apple moves towards an eSIM-only design.\n\nApple Watches, iOS 16 release date, and more\n\nNew Apple Watch models are expected to be unveiled on Wednesday, including a higher-end offering. An official release date for iOS 16, the much-hyped latest update that will let users personalize their iPhone lock screens (like Android does) and features a revamped iMessage, is also expected to be announced.\n\nWhat not to expect\n\nWith the new iPhone expected to take center stage, many analysts don’t expect Apple to release new iPads or Mac computers until October. Of course, the rumor mill can always be wrong about these things. Apple is also unlikely to debut its previously rumored and much-anticipated AR headset on Wednesday.\n\nDespite rival Samsung’s love affair with foldable devices, Apple is still not expected to unveil such an iPhone this fall.\n\nCNN Business will carry live coverage of Cook’s big production, so tune in here as the world’s most valuable tech company finally puts all rumors to rest and reveals some of its latest gadgets on the cusp of the busy holiday shopping season.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke Samantha Murphy Kelly", "Catherine Thorbecke", "Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/tech/wwdc-2022-what-to-expect/index.html", "title": "WWDC 2022: What to expect at this week's Apple conference | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nApple is about to hold its annual developer conference this week where it’s expected to show off new software coming to its most popular devices and possibly offer the biggest hint yet about a new product long rumored to be in development.\n\nAt its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off virtually on Monday and runs through Friday, Apple is expected to show off its latest operating system, iOS 16, which could reportedly include a revamped notification center and lock screen for iPhones as well as new health features and social features for iMessage. Other rumors point to new TV OS features, which could tie into the smart home; an upgrade to Apple Watch OS that would boost the battery life; and a new MacBook Air.\n\nSome analysts are also holding out hope that Apple (AAPL) could offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS. The system could power the mixed reality headset — a wearable device that’s said to be capable of both virtual and augmented reality — which Apple (AAPL) has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, has taken to calling the rumored hardware product “Apple Glasses,” in an apparent nod to Google’s early and failed foray into smart glasses. In an investor note this week, Ives said he expects Apple to “hit on a number of AR/VR technologies to developers that the company plans to introduce.”\n\n“Ultimately this strategy is laying the breadcrumbs to the highly anticipated AR headset Apple Glasses set to make its debut likely before holiday season or latest early 2023,” he said.\n\nCook has long been vocal about Apple’s vision to dive deeper into AR, calling it “the next big thing” and “a critically important part of Apple’s future.” Whether this is the year Apple finally shows its cards for that future, however, is anyone’s guess.\n\nApple’s event will be livestreamed on its website, YouTube and other social media platforms. It is set to start at 10:00 a.m. PT/1:00 p.m. ET. Here’s a closer look at what to expect:\n\nThe iPhone lock screen gets a refresh\n\nSimilar to last year, iOS 16 features aren’t expected to be game changers, but a few additions could breathe new life into the user experience.\n\nApple is expected to make messages more social and interactive and to rework the notification system and lock screen with a greater focus on widgets, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRamon Llamas, research director at IDC Research, said Apple could create a valuable opportunity for developers by rethinking the real estate on the lockscreen to move away from static notifications of texts and emails and toward interactive experiences like schedules, weather and news.\n\n“Think of all the things and widgets you could see just at a glance without having to open your iPhone,” Llamas said. “Now tie them to your homescreen. It’s a part of the iPhone experience that has been mostly the same and would benefit from a refresh.”\n\nUpdates to iPad and Mac software\n\nWith iPadOS, meanwhile, Apple is expected to double down on multitasking features to play up its powerful in-house M1 processor. According to Bloomberg, the update could make the iPad feel more like a laptop and less like a phone.\n\nApple is also expected to unveil its latest Mac OS, with the rumored name Mac Mammoth. It could offer refreshes to apps such as Mail, Notes and Safari, and similar social functionality in Messages to what’s rumored to be coming to iPhones.\n\nApple may add home automation improvements to both its HomePod speaker and Apple TV, as well as its broader HomeKit ecosystem. It’s also possible Apple could announce a refresh to Apple Watch OS, with the promise of new health features, workouts and watch faces.\n\nHardware improvements\n\nIf Apple’s prior developer conferences are any indication, it’s unlikely the company will unveil any major new hardware products at the event this year. But it’s possible Apple could shine a spotlight on its next-generation M2 chip and discuss some developer opportunities around it. For example, Apple could unveil a new MacBook Air by showing what the system would be capable of with its latest in-house processor.\n\n“Usually, new hardware comes out later in the year, so don’t be disappointed if you don’t see something,” Llamas said. “But even if Apple does, I think the bigger news is not the hardware itself, but Apple’s own silicon that powers them.”\n\nA look at the future of AR/VR\n\nThe big wild card at WWDC is whether Apple makes a splashy announcement around augmented reality or focuses on more incremental updates.\n\nRather than unveiling a mixed reality headset now, Apple may outline how developers could use its existing ARKit platform and its programming language, Swift, to create content for AR and VR broadly. (Apple’s tagline for the event is “Swiftly approaching.” The company often hides clues in images and taglines of its events’ invites.)\n\n“It’s quite possible the company will tease new AR/VR features without outright revealing a new device,” said Eric Abbruzzese, research director at ABI Research. But, as he notes, it would be unusual for Apple to reveal a new software system for a hardware line it has yet to unveil.\n\n“It’d be like revealing iOS before the iPhone was revealed,” Abbruzzese added.\n\nWhile it’s unclear if Apple will be laying the framework for a bigger push around AR/VR hardware in the pipeline, it’s quite likely Apple executives will dedicate a good portion of its keynote presentation to software around those technologies.\n\n“Apple’s been building ARKit on the mobile device side for years,” Abbruzzese said. “Much of that will absolutely translate to their headsets.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/03/14/tesla-model-y-suv-reveal/3152079002/", "title": "Tesla Model Y: Elon Musk to reveal newest electric vehicle, an SUV", "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk will unveil the automaker's newest electric vehicle at an event Thursday night in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Model Y will make its debut as questions swirl regarding the SUV's design, tech features, exact timing and pricing.\n\nTesla must deliver a functional interior and improved reliability to appeal to pragmatic, family-oriented compact SUV buyers, said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at car-buying advice site Edmunds.\n\n\"This is not a sports-car segment,\" Caldwell said. \"These are not young Tesla enthusiasts thinking this is my way into a Tesla.

And many buyers will likely pay $50,000 or more, they predicted.\n\n\"There will be a lot of questions about the price,\" Caldwell said. \"Not only are we looking for a pricing announcement but some assurance that they’re actually going to offer that vehicle at that price.\"\n\nYou won't be able to get one for a while\n\nIf history is any guide, Tesla will likely begin accepting online orders soon after Thursday night's event, if not immediately after. But that doesn't mean you should expect to drive one anytime soon.\n\nMusk has said that production will begin slowly in early 2020 and hit high volumes by late 2020. But Tesla has repeatedly missed production goals in the past.\n\n\"They need to confirm that the car has a realistic timeline that they can meet,\" Brauer said. \"This would be a good time to not overpromise and underdeliver.\"\n\nIt's a lot like the Model 3\n\nThe Model Y is based on the same architectural platform as the Model 3.\n\nThat allows Tesla to save costs by using about 75 percent of the same parts, Musk told investors in January.\n\nAssembled in Reno?\n\nThat's an unusual place to manufacture vehicles. Most U.S.-assembled cars are made in the Midwest or the South, with the notable exception of the Tesla Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles made in Fremont, California.\n\nThe automaker has said it will likely make the Model Y at its battery factory in Nevada, where it continues to expand production. But that will require a major investment in assembly line equipment and employee training to get started.\n\n\"Batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle,\" Musk said in January. \"So that also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts from California to Nevada. It's not a for-sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/04/04/tesla-blames-its-hubris-delays-model-x-deliveries/82630800/", "title": "Tesla shares climb despite 'hubris,' production delays", "text": "Chris Woodyard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n\n\nShares of Tesla Motors rose another 3.4% Tuesday as excitement continued to build over the electric-car maker's next model.\n\nInvestors didn't appear shaken by Tesla's report Monday that a shortage of parts reduced the number of Model X crossovers it could build in the first quarter.\n\nTesla shares closed Tuesday at $255.47, up $8.48, to its highest price since September. The rise was fueled by interest in the electric-car maker's debut last week of its first sedan for the mass market, the Model 3. By Saturday night, two days after the unveiling, Tesla had received orders for more than 276,000 cars, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe unveiling was followed by Tesla's disclosure that supplier parts shortages on its Model X crossovers reduced its projected deliveries. The automaker, which has its auto plant in Fremont, Calif., says it delivered 12,420 of its Model S luxury electric sedans in the first quarter, but only 2,400 of its new Model X crossovers.\n\nIn unusually frank terms, the automaker said, \"the root causes of the parts shortages were: Tesla’s hubris in adding far too much new technology to the Model X in version 1, insufficient supplier capability validation, and Tesla not having broad enough internal capability to manufacture the parts in-house.\"\n\nThe shortage involved only about six out of 8,000 unique parts that go into the Model X, which is distinguished among SUVs by its unique rear upward-opening gullwing-style doors, the company said. Tesla did not specify which parts were in short supply.\n\n\"The Q1 delivery count was impacted by severe Model X supplier parts shortages in January and February that lasted much longer than initially expected,\" the company said in a statement. \"Once these issues were resolved, production and delivery rates improved dramatically. By the last full week of March, the build rate rose to 750 Model X vehicles per week, however many of these vehicles were built too late to be delivered to their owners before end of quarter.\"\n\nTesla says it is on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new vehicles this year.\n\nTesla says it has addressed its delivery shortcomings and assures they will not be repeated when the Model 3 sedan launches late next year.\n\nAnalyst James Albertine of Stifel said in a note to investors Monday that he is concerned that the Model X is an \"over-engineered product\" that presents a challenge for Tesla.

I’m confident it’ll be the best car in its class, gasoline or not, hands down.”\n\nRelated:\n\nTesla Model 3 to debut: First buyers getting long-awaited electric car\n\nWe get our first drive in Tesla's electric Model 3\n\nMusk vs. Zuck showdown over artificial intelligence\n\nElon Musk: I got 'verbal' approval for 29-minute NYC-to-DC hyperloop\n\nCertainly a lot rides on the Model 3’s tires. Tesla has become a cultural touchstone because of its fast and expensive $69,500-and-up Model S and X electric sedans, but with the $35,000 Model 3 it hopes usher EVs into the mainstream while turbocharging its production numbers to calm investors.\n\nTesla produces around 100,000 vehicles a year, all Model S and X. Now with the Model 3, it hopes to ramp up to 600,000.\n\nTesla’s stock continues to soar despite questions about profitability, rocketing to $334 from $235 in the past 12 months. But some analysts aren’t sure Model 3 can be Tesla’s savior.\n\n“The make-or-break part of this for Tesla isn’t the production numbers, it’s the profitability and ownership experience issues,” said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book.\n\n“If one or both are off, it’s big trouble,” he said. “It’s tough to be a company that specializes in EVs, as they’re only 1% of market and most electric cars aren’t profitable for their companies.”\n\nMusk seemed well aware of the challenges ahead, notably an initial factory break-in period. There are around 10,000 parts that make up a Model 3, 70% of which are made in North America. The CEO suggested that suppliers held the key to the Model 3’s smooth launch.\n\n“It’s an amazing car, but we’re going to go through six months of manufacturing hell first,” he said. “Production will move as fast as the slowest parts (supplier).”\n\nThere’s evidence that the Model 3 should be easier to make, which perhaps could mean fewer quality issues that were the bane of Tesla’s first two technologically complex models.\n\nThe Model 3 features only one central screen in the middle of its dash, compared with two in the S and X. The car is built from steel and aluminum, versus the more complicated all-aluminum construction of its more expensive siblings. Initial models will not be available with complex four-wheel-drive mechanicals, just rear-wheel-drive. Its door handles do not automatically retract but are manually operated.\n\n“There’s nothing in that car that doesn’t need to be there,” Musk said. “As we gain confidence with the production rate, we’ll add increasing amounts of complexity.”\n\nMusk was on hand to deliver the first 30 cars to employees, who will serve as guinea pigs for the production team looking to ferret out quality issues.\n\nWhereas many owners of Model S and X sedans likely have other cars, the Model 3 is aimed at a market where repair issues could leave owners stranded. There could be a concern that if early owners report problems, those on the wait list could cancel their orders.\n\nMusk is unconcerned. “Have you ever seen an ad for Model 3?” he said. “There are no discounts. If we did anything other than try and put brakes on demand, it would go bananas.\"\n\nAnother factor that Tesla has to contend with is that it has around 79,000 of its 200,000 federal rebates left, meaning future Model 3 buyers would not be able to recoup $7,500 — a significant incentive on a $35,000 car.\n\nAround 500,000 people have put down a $1,000 deposit for a Model 3. Customer cars should start rolling out toward the end of the year. Anyone ordering a Model 3 today would receive it by the end of 2018, Musk said.\n\nThis initial enthusiasm makes the Model 3 a potential “lynchpin for the electric movement,” said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com. “It could be the car that forces people to finally consider this as a very real option.”\n\nOther automakers have tried to excite consumers with models such as the BMW i3 and Chevy Bolt, which are priced similar to the Model 3. But EVs remain a tough sell.\n\nCaldwell said the Model 3’s appeal has to be strong enough to convince urban dwellers to hook up battery chargers and consider range when planning a trip. She adds that communicating with consumers on long lines also will be important.\n\nShe said her own company has a Model X, and \"we're on a priority list for a Model 3, but we haven't heard anything about where we are in the queue.\"\n\nThe Model 3 will initially be offered in two iterations: a $35,000 base model with 220 miles of battery range, a 130 mile-per-hour top speed and a zero-to-60 mph time of 5.6 seconds; and a $44,000 version with 310 miles of range, 140 mph top speed and 5.1 seconds to 60 mph.\n\nIn a short test drive, the Model 3 seemed to deliver on its promise of being a baby Model S, boasting snappy acceleration and a high-tech interior. A single 15-inch touchscreen is the only piece of hardware on the dash, harboring all of the car's controls. The car has a normal if not large trunk, and not a lift-gate like its bigger cousins.\n\nFor Musk, Model 3’s success isn’t just critical to his company’s fiscal health, but also to that of a planet grappling with a warming atmosphere.\n\n“It’s a great day for Tesla, one we’ve been working towards since the beginning of the company,” Musk said. “If you try to make a difference in the world (with electric cars), you have to make cars people can afford.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musk-pickup-design/4269147002/", "title": "Tesla Cybertruck: Elon Musk pickup design stuns, aims at niche ...", "text": "The Tesla Cybertruck might be from the future, but it's probably not the future.\n\nThat's the immediate reaction from analysts after Tesla CEO Elon Musk rolled out what can only be described as one of the most stunning reveals in recent automotive history on Thursday night.\n\nMusk debuted the pickup to a chorus of bewilderment, as the vehicle's triangular shape, atypical truck bed and stainless steel body immediately set it apart from anything else on the market.\n\nWith a starting price of $39,900, a top-trim model range of up to 500-plus miles and 0-to-60 acceleration time of less than 2.9 seconds, the Tesla Cybertruck is unlike any other pickup.

Taking Ian’s estimated impact into account, Daco now projects GDP growth of 1.7% in the third quarter and a contraction of 1.4% in the fourth quarter.\n\n“You have power outages, you have flight cancellations, you have disruptions to energy extraction and refinement, you have disruptions to crops — all of those are part of normal economic activity,” Daco said.\n\nAnd some of that lost economic activity is never regained or even fully replaced by reconstruction efforts, he said.\n\n“We have to be careful about this so-called ‘broken window fallacy’ — this idea that if you break a window, because you have to repair it, you’re essentially generating output,” he said. “That does not hold in the case of a natural disaster in any form.”\n\n“You do not double up on the energy production after a hurricane; you do not double your crops … you’re not going to work twice as hard next week because you had no power this week,” he added.\n\nAlthough an immense effort of reconstruction and repair work will be undertaken, and that effort will bolster economic output, the benefits will filter out over multiple months, he added.\n\n“In terms of the impact on growth, it’s likely to be invisible, relative to the national economy,” he said.\n\nThe magnitude of impact to local economies and to key tourism-centric industries in Florida and South Carolina are likely to be “severe,” according to Matthew Martin, a US economist with Oxford Economics.\n\n“Damage to Florida’s and South Carolina’s leisure and hospitality, retail trade and health care industries will be key for assessing the economic impact, since they collectively account for about 20% of each state’s GDP and 40% of jobs,” Martin wrote in a note published Friday.\n\nNoting the hurricane “does not pose a major threat to the US economy,” Martin wrote that the supply chain stress is expected to be relatively modest. The ports of Florida and Charleston, South Carolina, process less than 10% of total US imports, and some have already resumed operations, he wrote.\n\nA couple walks past damage from Hurricane Ian on Litchfield Beach, South Carolina on October 1, 2022.

Many outages remain in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties, with 208,263 outages in Lee County and 75,721 outages in Charlotte County. Outages also continue to be tracked in Sarasota, Manatee, Collier, Hendry, Hardee, and Desoto counties.\n\nIn some cases, government officials dealing with recovery efforts are among those who lost their homes.\n\nFort Myers Beach City Councilman Bill Veach said his 90-year-old cottage is in ruins, with only one section that was a recent addition left standing. Pieces of his home were found two blocks away, he said.\n\n“When you are walking around the ruins, it’s an apocalyptic scene,” Veach said of his neighborhood.\n\nStill, even in the wreckage, there have been moments of hope, he said.\n\n“You see a friend that you weren’t sure was alive or dead and that brings you joy. A joy that is so much more than the loss of property,” he added.\n\nDebris lies around Bill Veach's badly damaged home in Fort Myers Beach. Bill Veach\n\nRescuers have been coming to the aid of trapped residents via boat and aircraft. Statewide, more than 2,300 rescues have been made and over 1,000 urban search and rescue personnel have checked 79,000 structures, Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a news conference Tuesday. The governor also announced the opening of the first Disaster Recovery Center – or “one-stop shop” – in Fort Myers for residents and businesses that have been affected by Hurricane Ian.\n\nLive updates: Hurricane Ian’s aftermath in Florida\n\nSome residents who were anxiously waiting to hear from their loved ones have received unimaginable news.\n\nStacy Verdream told CNN she and her brother found out Monday their uncle, Mike Verdream, died in the storm. Mike Verdream decided to ride out Hurricane Ian in Matlacha, Florida, and planned to go to his boss’ two-story home if things got too bad.\n\nStacy Verdream said she spoke with her uncle briefly on Wednesday. Her cousin spoke with him later that day and he said the water was 4 feet deep before telling her he had to go.\n\n“It was a very brief call because he said he was very scared and she’d never heard him like that, because he wasn’t that type of person. He’s always put on a brave face,” Stacy Verdream said. “But she said he sounded absolutely terrified.”\n\nThe family was unable to reach Mike Verdream because his phone was wet, his niece said. A detective told Stacy Verdream on Tuesday that her uncle was found in a canal on Friday. The condition of his body was consistent with other victims that had been recovered, Verdream said. Authorities used medical records to identify her uncle because his face was not recognizable, Verdream said. An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n“He was always there for me growing up, teaching me how to drive and taking me to the fair,” she said. “The cool uncle that would buy me like a dirt bike and bought the Jet ski for us to, like, go out on the lake. He just loved us to death.”\n\nA home lies in ruins Monday in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers Beach. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth McGuire’s family said they last spoke with her Wednesday and had been having trouble reaching her. They learned Friday that the 49-year-old had been found dead in her Cape Coral home.\n\nPolice told her family she died in her bed holding her cell phone and it looked like she died instantly, her son Andrew Chedester said.\n\nMcGuire’s mother, Susan McGuire, said the destruction of the storm “is massive.”\n\n“One hundred blizzards will not cost you what one hurricane will cost you,” said Susan McGuire, who moved to Florida from Maryland a few years ago. “My husband’s business whipped out, my daughter is dead … I never had a blizzard take anything away from me.”\n\nHomes are ‘unlivable’ on islands cut off from the mainland, with ‘alligators running around’\n\nOn Sanibel Island, now cut off from the Florida peninsula after Ian wiped out a portion of the roadway connecting them, every house shows damage, Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said.\n\n“There are a lot of places that are not livable. There are places off their foundation, and it’s very dangerous out there,” Briscoe said. “There are alligators running around, and there are snakes all over the place.”\n\nCrews have evacuated 1,000 people from Sanibel since Ian ripped through the island, Briscoe said.\n\nSanibel Mayor Holly Smith told CNN Tuesday that residents will be allowed back on the island Wednesday to assess the damage to their property, but the island is still “extremely unsafe.”\n\n“Roads are 90% clear on the island … meaning that there’s enough vehicular access that has been cut through the debris so vehicles and employees servicing the island can get through,” Dana Souza, Sanibel city manager, said.\n\nSanibel remains under a 24-hour curfew. Tomorrow, residents and business owners can access the island between 7 a.m. and 7p.m., Souza said. The National Guard will work with police to enforce checkpoints throughout the island, making sure that only those with a resident ID or hurricane pass are onsite.\n\n“We’re only allowing people who are Sanibel residents, business owners or property owners, back on the island and you must have those credentials. If you don’t have them, they will ask you to leave,” Souza said.\n\nA similar situation is playing out on nearby Pine Island, the largest barrier island on Florida’s Gulf Coast. Just days ago, it was a tranquil fishing and kayaking destination known for its small-town atmosphere. Now it’s a scene of carnage, with cracked roadways and destroyed homes.\n\nIan destroyed the only bridge to Pine Island, making it only accessible by boat or aircraft. Supplies are now being airdropped to the island by helicopter as some residents choose to stay, authorities said.\n\nCounty officials are trying to get a temporary ferry service for Sanibel, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Tuesday. For Pine Island, work is underway to install a temporary bridge, with a goal to have it ready by the end of the week, DeSantis has said.\n\nEmergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who joined rescuers on Pine Island, said crews are encountering residents who were in denial the storm would hit the area and are now running out of supplies.\n\n“I’m seeing a lot of despair, but I’m also seeing hope,” Abo said. “I’m seeing urban search and rescue, fire rescue, bringing hope to people that we’re going to get through this. But we have to do it in stages.”\n\nThe National Guard will also be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to start working on restoring power. It could take at least a month to restore power for some places on those islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan said Tuesday.\n\nDeSantis said Tuesday he has already visited Pine Island and will likely visit Sanibel Island Wednesday, one week after it was ravaged by Hurricane Ian.\n\n“We’re gonna have that bridge patched this week,” DeSantis said Tuesday of Pine Island. “Yesterday we had 130 (Florida Department of Transportation) trucks that were there working to get this temporary bridge fixed. It will be done this week.”\n\nDeSantis also directed the state’s transportation department to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway. A contract for the repair was awarded Tuesday with the end goal of having the causeway fully repaired by the end of the month, according to a news release.\n\nRight now, emergency repairs to the causeway will help first responders and emergency services access the barrier island to aid with recovery efforts, power restoration, and removal of debris. Long-term repairs will follow, giving residents “drivable” access to and from the mainland.\n\n“The Sanibel Causeway was affected when the land that the road was built on was washed away,” FDOT Secretary Jared Perdue said in a statement. “A bridge stability analysis will be performed, and repairs needed range from repairing bridge approaches to restoring the roadway across most of the causeway.”\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach, where storm surge and wind combined to wipe out numerous homes and businesses, it may also take a month to restore power due to damage to the electrical infrastructure,” Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nFlorida Army National Guard members help Tim Tuitt, left, and John Davis as they are evacuated from Fort Myers Beach on Monday. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAs rescue efforts continue, it’s unclear how many are still missing\n\nIt’s unclear how many people remain unaccounted for after the storm. Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said authorities are working to consolidate a list of the missing.\n\nSearch teams have been combing a 7-mile stretch of Fort Myers Beach for days, looking for anyone still in need of help. One of the teams, South Florida Task Force 2, found 150 people trapped in homes in its first 48 hours in the community, some of whom had ascended to attics to avoid floodwater, it said.\n\nOn Monday, the team still was helping people off the island town, as well as telling them where to get food and water. The team has found people who died at Fort Myers Beach, but it has not said how many.\n\nBob and Rosemary Kopsack were among those the team helped off the island Monday, after the storm ruined virtually everything inside their home. Bob Kopsack still didn’t know the fate of at least one of their friends on the island.\n\n“Our best friend, we have not been able to contact him … and he’d said he’s not leaving the island. And I hope he did,” he said. “His phone’s out. … I’ve sent the police over to his home.”\n\nIn Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Fort Meyers Beach, more than half the schools had at least some damage from Ian – and 14% had major damage, the school district said. Schools will reopen as quickly as possible, Superintendent Christopher Bernier said, without providing a timeline.\n\nAt Fort Myers Beach Elementary, mud lined a cafeteria; damaged desks, toppled supplies and other debris were piled up in a hallway; and water marks reached nearly to the tops of doorjambs, photos released by the district showed.\n\nDebris litters Fort Myers Beach Elementary in this photo released by the school district Monday. Lee County Schools\n\nCharlotte County Public Schools will be closed until further notice, according to spokesperson Mike Riley, who said that several of their 22 schools have been damaged by the storm.\n\nRiley said the district is having all the buildings inspected to make sure everything is safe before students and staff return.\n\n“The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” he said.\n\nA Fort Myers man clung to branches for hours – and his daughters thought him lost\n\nSome residents who lost property and belongings are recounting narrow escapes.\n\nWhen Ian hit Florida’s west coast and floodwater surged through Fort Myers, Stan Pentz, 69, texted his daughter, Stephanie Downing, and told her the water was rising in his condo and he might drown. Then, he lost phone service, he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nMore than an hour away, Downing assumed the worst. When she saw her sister the next day, “we just held each other and we just cried because we truly thought he was gone.”\n\nPentz managed to get out, however. Upon escaping his home, he was “swished away,” he recalled, and he latched onto some branches, clinging to them for hours, “with the wind blowing and the water gushing over my head. It was a long time.” After a while. the wind and water shifted and he reached the second floor of a building, where he huddled in a corner till sunrise, he said.\n\n“It just kept going and going. It wouldn’t stop and I was just thinking about my kids and my grandkids and just everybody I know, and they just kept me going in my mind,” he said.\n\nThe storm passed, and Pentz found someone to text Downing for him. Downing’s sister and brother-in-law drove down to Fort Myers and retrieved him.\n\nWhen Downing finally saw her dad, “I laid my head on his chest and I said, ‘Hey, Michael Phelps, you had a nice swim,’” she recalled as Pentz chuckled, playfully pantomiming slapping his daughter.\n\nPentz lost everything. He kicked his own submerged automobile as he swam to safety, he said. Downing said he’s now staying with her family at their Rotonda West home. A GoFundMe has raised thousands and a generous friend brought her dad some clothes and shoes. He was able to replace his cell phone and driver’s license Tuesday, Downing said.\n\n“We’re getting somewhere,” she said.\n\nMan says he moved through nearly half a mile of floodwater to rescue his mother\n\nA Naples man, meanwhile, trekked through nearly half a mile of floodwater to save his 85-year-old mother after Ian hit.\n\nJohnny Lauder, a former police officer, told CNN he sprang into action after his mother, who uses a wheelchair, called in a panic and said water was rushing into her home and reaching her chest.\n\nHe arrived at her home to find her neck-deep in floodwater, but happy to see her son.\n\n“The water was up to the windows, and I heard her screaming inside,” Lauder said. “It was a scare and a sigh of relief at the time – a scare thinking she might be hurt, a sigh of relief knowing that there was still air in her lungs.”\n\nLauder was able to bring his mother to safety as floodwaters began to recede.\n\nHospitals in Florida have been experiencing “significant pressure” on capacity since Ian hit, said Mary Mayhew, president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association.\n\nEmergency departments have sustained damage, staffing has been impacted as many hospital workers have been displaced or lost their vehicles in the hurricane, and facilities lost reliable access to water.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/hurricane-ian-florida-recovery-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian: Sanibel residents return to an unrecognizable island ...", "text": "Sanibel Island, Florida CNN —\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Ian left Julie Emig and Vicki Paskaly devastated when they returned to what was once their “dream home” for the first time since the storm hit one week ago.\n\nResidents of Florida’s Sanibel Island – which remains cutoff from the mainland – were allowed back for the first time Wednesday, with a warning that they could be shocked when they returned to their hard-hit community. Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home. CNN\n\nThe walk from the shoreline of Sanibel Island to Emig and Paskaly’s home was less than a mile along a windy, sandy road. On the way, the couple saw a familiar bright blue street sign lying mangled in the mud in a pile of twisted gutters, blankets and branches. They also passed a large banyan tree that had many of its branches twisted and snapped, with one large branch lying in front of a neighbor’s garage.\n\nAs they neared their home, Paskaly said with a heavy sigh: “I’m afraid to turn the corner.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly saw this mangled sign on Sanibel Island as the couple returned to check on their home. CNN\n\nSanibel’s reopening to residents came the same day President Joe Biden visited Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, was also briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nStatewide, more than 270,000 customers still have no power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties. Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky.\n\n“Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.”\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida.

By Friday night, it was continuing to pack 60 mph winds but was expected to weaken overnight and dissipate over North Carolina or Virginia late Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nFlash flooding was possible in parts of North and South Carolina and southeast Virginia Friday night, while the storm also threatened parts of eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia with tornadoes through Saturday morning, the hurricane center added.\n\nTwo days earlier, Ian made landfall along Florida’s southwestern coast as a major Category 4 hurricane, ravaging coastal communities, turning roads into streams and leaving behind wreckage and debris.\n\nAs communities in the Sunshine State were beginning to pick up the pieces after the powerful storm, authorities in South Carolina late Friday began assessing the damage to their state. Authorities in Pawleys Island, a coastal South Carolina town roughly 70 miles north of Charleston, were cataloging the damage Friday night.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nTwo piers in the state – Cherry Grove Pier in North Myrtle Beach and Pawleys Island Pier – partially collapsed due to the storm. Water had receded on the two causeways, but Pawleys Island police announced they were not letting anyone back on the island until safety assessments were conducted in the morning.\n\nMore than 128,000 customers were in the dark across the state as of 9:30 p.m. Friday, according to poweroutage.us. In North Carolina, more than 330,000 customers were out of power and in Florida, more than 1.4 million.\n\nKnee-deep water inside homes\n\nIn North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Kyle Faust waded through knee-deep water inside his home Friday after the storm roared through. Across Horry County, where the city is located, officials reported Friday night crews were conducting damage assessments and clearing debris, while some roads remained closed.\n\nMyrtle Beach Police urged residents to stay inside and not drive on flooded roadways.\n\n“It’s a pretty scary sight,” Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune remarked earlier of Hurricane Ian. “I’m seeing way too many cars passing by. And I think people just don’t realize how dangerous it is to be out in these types of conditions. We’ve seen so many people’s cars get stuck, and emergency personnel has to go out and rescue people.”\n\nShelters in Charleston County will remain open until 4 p.m. on Saturday, the county wrote in a news release. Buses will start taking people from the shelters back to the original pick-up locations Saturday morning.\n\n“A lot of prayers have been answered,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. “This storm is not as bad as it could have been, but don’t let your guard down yet. We are not out of the woods, there is water on the roads, still heavy winds, and it is still dangerous in many parts of the state.”\n\nCharleston International Airport’s airfield closed Friday because of high winds and extended the closure until Saturday morning, the airport said.\n\nIn Florida: At least 45 reported dead\n\nFlorida, meanwhile, confronted the dizzying destruction Ian wrought through much of the peninsula Wednesday and Thursday after it smashed into the southwest coast and plowed through central and northeastern areas.\n\nAt least 45 deaths have been reported in the state. Among them, friends of Kevin Behen, who told CNN on Friday night he knew of two men who died making sure their wives were able to escape the home they were all sheltering in that began to flood.\n\n“These guys pushed their wives out the windows to where a tree was,” Behen explained. “They just looked at their wives and they said, ‘We can’t hold on anymore, we love you. Bye,’ and that was it.”\n\nHomes on the coast were washed out to sea, buildings were smashed throughout the state, and floodwater ruined homes and businesses and trapped residents, even inland in places like the Orlando area.\n\nHundreds of rescues have taken place by land, air and sea, with residents stuck in homes or stranded on rooftops, and searchers have made many wellness checks, especially in the Fort Myers and Naples areas, where a storm surge inundated streets and homes.\n\n“It looked as though someone had just dropped from the sky picked up hotels and buildings and took them away,” Lee County manager Roger Desjarlais said. “We also know that not as many people evacuated from those islands as we had hoped for. We know there has to be many fatalities yet to be accounted for.”\n\nIan may have caused as much as $47 billion in insured losses in Florida, according to an estimate from property analytics firm CoreLogic, which could make it the second-most expensive storm in the state’s history when adjusted for inflation after 1992’s Hurricane Andrew.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida as it deals with the devastation caused by the storm, which he noted was “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history” and will likely take “months, years” to rebuild.\n\nAnd the storm’s aftermath poses new, deadly dangers of its own. Some standing water is electrified, officials warned, while maneuvering through debris-strewn buildings and streets – many without working traffic signals – risks injury. Lack of air conditioning can lead to heat illness, and improper generator use can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nMany without homes, water, power\n\nClaudette Smith, the public information officer for the sheriff’s office in Charlotte County, just north of Fort Myers, told CNN the county is in desperate need of help as emergency services continue to be inundated.\n\n“We need everything, to put it plain and simple. We need all hands on deck,” Smith stressed. “The people who have come to our assistance have been tremendously helpful, but we do need everything.”\n\nMany members of the community are without homes, water, and electricity, and there is currently only one operating hospital in the county.\n\nHere’s what to know about the destruction in Florida:\n\n• Deaths in Florida: At least 45 deaths suspected to be related to Ian have been reported in Florida, including 16 in Lee County, 12 in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, four in Volusia County, one in Polk County, one in Lake County, one in Manatee County and two in unincorporated Sarasota County, according to officials. Unconfirmed death cases are being processed by local medical examiners, who decide whether they are disaster-related, state emergency management Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\n• Hundreds of rescues and thousands of evacuations: The US Coast Guard has performed over 275 rescues in Florida, Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson told CNN. More than 700 rescues have happened across Florida so far, the governor reported Thursday, and thousands of evacuees have been reported. In Lee County, a hospital system had to evacuate more than 1,000 patients after its water supply was cut off, while other widespread evacuations have been reported in prisons and nursing homes. In Fort Myers, the fire chief was “pretty comfortable” by Friday morning everyone needing help there had been rescued, Mayor Kevin Anderson said. The Coast Guard is treating this like a military operation searching “block by block to make sure that everybody gets out.”\n\n• Historic flooding: Record flooding was recorded across central and northern Florida, including at least three rivers hitting all-time flood records. Officials in Orlando warned residents of dangerous flooding, which exceeded a foot in some areas.\n\n• Much of Fort Myers Beach obliterated: A helicopter flight over Fort Myers Beach shows utter devastation: empty or debris-littered lots where homes and businesses used to be and boats tossed into mangroves. “You’re talking about no structure left. … You’re talking about homes that were thrown into the bay. This is a long-term fix, and it’s life-changing,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno said.\n\n• Coastal islands isolated from mainland: Sanibel and Captiva islands in southwest Florida are cut off from the mainland after several parts of a critical causeway were torn away. At least two people were killed in the storm in Sanibel, and the bridge may need to be completely rebuilt, local officials said. Chip Farrar, a resident of the tiny island of Matlacha, told CNN 50 feet of road essential to reaching the mainland bridge has been washed out, and a second nearby bridge has also collapsed.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Alaa Elassar Jason Hanna Elizabeth Wolfe", "Christina Maxouris", "Alaa Elassar", "Jason Hanna", "Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/us/hurricane-ian-florida-recovery-monday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian: Death toll surpasses 100 as the search for survivors ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe number of people killed in Florida by Hurricane Ian rose to at least 101 on Monday, days after the storm made landfall at Category 4 strength, decimating coastal towns and leaving rescue crews searching for survivors while communities face the daunting task of rebuilding.\n\nAt least 54 people died in Lee County alone, Sheriff Carmine Marceno said Monday – up from the county’s previously announced death toll of 42 – and officials there are facing questions about whether evacuation orders should have been issued earlier. Twenty-four deaths were recorded in Charlotte County – up from 12.\n\nHurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of eight people in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County and one each in Lake, Hardee, Hendry, Hillsborough and Polk counties, officials said. Four other people died in storm-related incidents as Ian churned into North Carolina.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been rescued from Hurricane Ian’s path in parts of southwest and central Florida since last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said Sunday.\n\nNow, as blue skies return, Floridians who took shelter while the hurricane raged have emerged – many of them still without power or clean drinking water – to find their communities unrecognizable.\n\nMore than 491,000 homes, businesses and other customers in Florida still did not have power as of Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us.

It is not simply rehanging lines. There are things that may need to be replaced.”\n\nA man stands in front of a home damaged by storm surge in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Naples, Florida.

Hurricane Ian – expected to be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history – devastated neighborhoods from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nIn some cases, emergency workers out searching for signs of life are at the same time contending with losing their own homes.\n\n“Some of the guys on Pine Island, they lost everything, but they’re doing what they can,” said emergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who was preparing to join first responders on a rescue mission Sunday near decimated Sanibel Island and Pine Island.\n\nAnd the flooding isn’t over yet.\n\nSeminole County continues to experience significant flooding in certain neighborhoods, with families being rescued from waist-high waters over the weekend.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameraman rushes to help family during live report 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDays after the hurricane left, flooding continues to increase in areas near the St. Johns River, Lake Monroe, and Lake Harney, with an additional 100 homes suffering floodwater damage over the last 24 hours, Seminole County emergency management officials told CNN affiliate WESH.\n\nQuestions over timing of evacuation orders as deaths mount\n\nLee County officials have faced criticism about why the first mandatory evacuations weren’t ordered until a day before Ian’s landfall, despite an emergency plan which suggests evacuations should have happened earlier.\n\nDeSantis has said Lee County officials acted appropriately when they issued their first mandatory evacuations on Tuesday, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Ian made landfall on the barrier island Cayo Costa, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDesjarlais said the county made the decision to evacuate at the earliest time possible.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that so many people chose not to evacuate,” he said. “You know, I think I told you the other day we had room for 40,000 people in our shelters, but only 4,000 showed up, which means that people made the conscious choice not to evacuate, and it is regretful and you know, no one feels worse than we do about all that.”\n\nBut people are “used to longer evacuation orders,” Shawn Critser, a pastor in Fort Myers Beach, told CNN Monday. “But we got it the day before.”\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, Critser believed – like many others – that the heaviest impacts would be felt farther to the north, near Tampa Bay. But then the forecast was revised, showing the storm’s track shifting to the south.\n\n“When that evacuation order came, we’re like, ’24 hours, that’s not a lot. But we’ll still kind of make it,’” Critser said. “And it wasn’t until Wednesday morning when we woke up and saw that it had made another adjustment. And at that point, it’s just too late.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Miracle': Captain tells incredible story about his boat during Hurricane Ian 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSheriff Marceno stood by the handling of the evacuation orders Monday, saying he was “confident in our county manager, our leaders, our governor, all of us in law enforcement that we got that message out at the right time.”\n\nHard-hit Sanibel Island will be ‘out of commission’\n\nHurricane Ian wiped away parts of the Sanibel Causeway, which connects Sanibel Island to the mainland, stranding residents as their only link became impassable.\n\nSearch and rescue personnel have been going door-to-door searching properties for anyone who may need to be evacuated, and nearly 100 members of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue continue to conduct rescue efforts along Southwest Florida’s Barrier Islands like Sanibel, Captiva and Pine Island.\n\nThe fire rescue team is helping evacuate residents, dispensing medicine, treating injuries, helping people get in touch with family and just providing hard-to-come-by information, said Capt. Michelle Steele, a medical specialist.\n\n“People aren’t getting a whole lot of information right now.

Sanibel officials plan to post photos and information on whether the property is deemed destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe bridge to Pine Island was knocked out by the storm and the transportationdepartment hopes to have a temporary bridge in place by the end of the week, the governor said Monday.\n\n“This is not necessarily going to be a bridge you’re going to want to go 45 miles per an hour over, maybe, but at least you’ll have connectivity to the mainland,” DeSantis said.\n\nOfficials said food is being dropped at fire stations on Pine Island.\n\nPower could be out for weeks\n\nSome residents and businesses in storm-damaged counties may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because of the structural damage caused by the hurricane, said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nFPL expects to have power restored by Sunday to 95% of its 126,700 customers in Charlotte County, which includes Punta Gorda, Patrick Fuller, the county emergency management director said Monday.

Andrew West/USA Today Network Prev Next\n\n‘Anybody who lives near water’ should get flood insurance, FEMA chief says\n\nHurricane Ian could be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history, devastating communities from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nWhile Florida has more flood insurance policies than any other state, only about 13% of homes there have flood insurance, and only 18% who live in the counties that had mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders in place ahead of Ian, according to an analysis by actuarial firm Milliman.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Americans don’t have to live in a flood zone to benefit from flood insurance.\n\n“I think anybody who lives near water should certainly purchase flood insurance because it’s your No. 1 tool to help protect your family and your home after the storm,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said.\n\n“If you live near water or where it rains, it can certainly flood, and we have seen that (with) multiple storms this year.”\n\nShe said FEMA is in the process of updating its flood zone maps. “While in certain areas we require flood insurance, everybody has the ability to purchase flood insurance,” Criswell said\n\n“It is certainly in your best defense to help protect your property in the aftermath of any of these storms.”\n\nParts of Florida are now ‘unrecognizable’\n\nBut the most severe lashing took place in southwestern coastal cities like Fort Myers and Naples, where some neighborhoods were annihilated.\n\n“We’re flying and we’re operating in areas that are unrecognizable,” US Coast Guard Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson said.\n\n“There’s no street signs. They don’t look like they used to look like. Buildings that were once benchmarks in the community are no longer there.”\n\nMany of the Ian-related deaths have been reported in southwestern Florida’s Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Sanibel Island, where at least 42 people died.\n\n‘Unfortunately, people did get complacent’\n\nLocal officials are facing criticism about whether mandatory evacuations in Lee County should have been issued sooner.\n\nOfficials there did not order evacuations until less than 24 hours before the storm made landfall, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDeSantis defended the timing of Lee County’s orders, saying they were given as soon as the storm’s projected path shifted south, putting the area in Ian’s crosshairs.\n\n“As soon as we saw the model shift northeast, we did exactly what we could to encourage people to” evacuate, Lee County Commissioner Kevin Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“I’m just disappointed that so many people didn’t go to shelters, because they’re open.”\n\nRuane called the reporting about a possible delay in issuing a mandatory evacuation “inaccurate.” He said the county did what it was supposed to do, without providing any evidence that the reporting was inaccurate.\n\n“I think the most important thing that most people need to understand is we opened up 15 shelters. During Irma there were 60,000 people in our shelters. There’s 4,000 people in the shelters right now,” Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“Unfortunately, people did get complacent … As far as I’m concerned, the shelters were open, they had the ability, they had all day Tuesday, they had a good part of Wednesday as the storm was coming down – they had the ability to (go to a shelter).”\n\nThe US Coast Guard made plans to evacuate people from Lee County’s Pine Island on Sunday, according to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nIn addition to the 42 deaths in Lee County, Hurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of 12 people in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County, and one each in Polk, Lake, Hendry and Hillsborough counties, officials said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida, saying Hurricane Ian is “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history.”\n\nThe President and first lady Jill Biden are set to travel to Puerto Rico Monday to survey damage from Hurricane Fiona, then head to Florida on Wednesday.\n\n‘The houses … are all gone’\n\nMembers of mediccorps.org help evacuate Tom Acerbo on Pine Island, Florida, on Saturday.

He said he lost his home and two cars, but feels lucky to be alive.\n\n“A lot of people have very expensive, well-built homes on Sanibel, and they felt with their multi-million dollar homes built like fortresses, they would be fine,” he said.\n\nBoyle was riding out the storm at home when the dining room roof collapsed. “That’s when we started to get concerned,” he said.\n\nHe described waving down National Guard aircraft the next day outside his house, and seeing the scenes of devastation around the island.\n\n“When you go to the east end of the island, there’s just a lot of destruction. The houses surrounding the lighthouse are all gone. When you go to the west end of the island, the old restaurants up there, they’re all gone. The street going to Captiva is now a beach,” Boyle said.\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex and is now in his neighbor’s yard.

Her oven is filled with mud, and water still spills out of the kitchen cabinets.\n\n“I’m almost ready to cry right now talking to you,” Fisher said. “But it’s okay because we’re alive and we’re here.

Many storms weaken when they reach colder waters.\n\nFiona is expected to continue to gradually weaken over the next few days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in Atlantic Canada remained without power Sunday and Canadian officials continue to assess the scope of the devastation. Fiona brought widespread power outages.\n\nMore than 400,000 Nova Scotia Power customers had been affected by outages Saturday, the company reported.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, more than 211,000 Nova Scotia Power customers and over 81,000 Maritime Electric customers in the province of Prince Edward Island were without power.

One death was confirmed.\n\nAuthorities found the body of a 73-year-old woman in the water who was missing in Channel-Port Aux Basques, a town on the southern coast of Newfoundland, late Sunday afternoon.\n\nCanadian police said the woman was last seen inside the residence moments before a wave struck the home Saturday morning, tearing away a portion of the basement.\n\nBrian Button, mayor of Channel-Port Aux Basques, said houses were already being washed away by floodwaters, and residents were fleeing to higher grounds.\n\n\"I’m seeing homes in the ocean,\" said René J.

The measure next goes to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the measure.\n\nDemocrats said passing the bill was important to helping victims of recent natural disasters in the U.S., including Hurricane Ian, as it provides a Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster fund with a year’s worth of money up front rather than for two-and-a-half months.\n\nFlorida Democratic Party Chair Manny Diaz blasted Florida Republican House members — all of whom voted against the stopgap spending measure to help storm victims — for not supporting Floridians.\n\n“The same week that Hurricane Ian brought so much chaos and destruction to Florida, not a single Florida Republican cared enough to vote in favor of Hurricane relief for the people in their own state hit hardest by the storm,\" he said. \"That is a level of callous indifference and political opportunism that boggles the mind.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, President Biden and Florida Democrats are doing the right thing when it counts, and we appreciate their efforts to help Florida rebuild once again,” he added.\n\nMore is certain to be needed from Congress because Hurricane Ian alone devastated southwest Florida and flooding caused damages throughout much of the state.

Yates and released Monday, was based on more than 200 interviews and reveals the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) under the US Soccer Federation (USSF) failed to provide a safe environment for players.\n\n“Our investigation has revealed a league (NWSL) in which abuse and misconduct — verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct — had become systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches, and victims,” the report reads. “Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women’s soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players.”\n\nThe report comes about a year after the 12-team NWSL was thrown into chaos following a report by The Athletic detailing allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct against Paul Riley, who coached three NWSL franchises over eight seasons. He was fired by the North Carolina Courage after The Athletic cited players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.\n\nRiley denied the accusations in the report. CNN has not been able to reach Riley for comment.\n\nIn the wake of that report, then-NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird resigned and the league called off all matches scheduled for that weekend. By the end of the year, half of the league’s teams had parted ways with their coaches after player complaints, the Yates report notes.\n\nMonday’s report states that sexual misconduct and abuse was far more widespread than just one coach or incident.\n\n“In well over 200 interviews, we heard report after report of relentless, degrading tirades; manipulation that was about power, not improving performance; and retaliation against those who attempted to come forward,” the report states. “Even more disturbing were the stories of sexual misconduct. Players described a pattern of sexually charged comments, unwanted sexual advances and sexual touching, and coercive sexual intercourse.”\n\nThe league said Monday it would review the findings.\n\n“We recognize the anxiety and mental strain that these pending investigations have caused and the trauma that many — including players and staff — are having to relive,” the league said in a statement.\n\nThe league’s own investigation in conjunction with the players’ union is ongoing, the NWSL said.\n\nThe Yates report features submitted first-hand accounts from players who describe abuses from head coaches as well as team management.\n\nIn one case, a head coach allegedly asked a player to review match footage 1-on-1 at his house only to show pornography instead. According to the report, the same manager “sexually coerced” that player and “grabbed and groped her in public, but out of view.”\n\nThere are multiple allegations or findings in the report of sexual harassment and misconduct by head coaches.\n\nThe report notes abusive coaches were able to move from team to team despite accusations levied against them because the league and the federation feared the organizations could be named in any potential defamation or employment lawsuits.\n\nYates recommends a public “list of individuals disciplined, suspended, or banned by USSF, a USSF Organization Member, or SafeSport.”\n\nThe US Center for SafeSport is an organization authorized by Congress and designed to end sexual, emotional and physical abuse in Olympic sports.\n\n“This is very emotional for me, and honestly I’m having trouble absorbing everything in the report,” US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone told reporters during a video conference call. “I think it will take some time to really read through it and think about the actions and inactions of certain people and then will take us some time to think about what needs to be done in terms of discipline.”\n\nEarlier, she said the US Soccer Federation, as the national governing body for soccer, “is fully committed to doing everything in its power to ensure that all players — at all levels — have a safe and respectful place to learn, grow and compete.”\n\nThe NWSL players association praised the players who cooperated with the investigation and spoke up about the abuse and misconduct.\n\n“As difficult as this report is to read, it has been even more painful for Players, whether known or unknown, to live it. We appreciate their efforts to seek the truth in support of our work to transform NWSL,” the association said.\n\n“These stories have inspired us to engage in collective action to bring about change. By sharing our stories, Players are reclaiming the League and the sport,” the association added.\n\nUS Soccer initiated the investigation a year ago by hiring Yates and the legal firm King and Spalding to review allegations, conduct interviews and recommend solutions. The federation says it gave Yates and the firm full autonomy and access in order to produce a complete, independent report.\n\nA US Soccer statement noted the federation’s board of directors had voted to release the full report on Monday while preserving “victim privacy and confidentiality.”", "authors": ["David Close Eric Levenson", "David Close", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/football/nwsl-soccer-abuse-explainer-intl-spt/index.html", "title": "NWSL abuse report: Fans are outraged and players are exhausted ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States Women’s National Team play England in a friendly at Wembley on Friday.

Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters\n\nUnited States Women’s National Team defender Crystal Dunn added she hoped the report will be the turning point for the sport.\n\n“I think this report coming out was kind of the nail in the coffin,” Dunn said at a press conference in London on Wednesday. “It’s going to allow a lot of accountability that hasn’t really taken place and I think I am quite hopeful that the healing phase can now really take place.”\n\nPlayers’ health and safety\n\nThe report, led by former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates, was based on more than 200 interviews and revealed the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) under the US Soccer Federation (USSF) failed to provide a safe environment for players.\n\nUS Soccer initiated its investigation a year ago by hiring Yates and the legal firm King and Spalding to review allegations, conduct interviews, and recommend solutions.\n\nThe federation says it gave Yates and the firm full autonomy and access in order to produce a complete, independent report.\n\nWhy was the report commissioned?\n\nLast year the 12-team NWSL was thrown into chaos following a report by The Athletic detailing allegations of sexual coercion and misconduct against Paul Riley, who coached three NWSL franchises over eight seasons.\n\nHe was fired by the North Carolina Courage after The Athletic cited players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.\n\nThe damning report found that abuse and misconduct in women's soccer was systemic. Nick Tre. Smith/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nRiley denied the accusations in the report. CNN has not been able to reach Riley for comment.\n\nBy the end of the season, “half of the league’s teams had parted ways” with their coaches after player complaints, the Yates report notes.\n\nWhat are the key findings?\n\nThe Yates report features submitted first-hand accounts from players who describe alleged abuses from head coaches as well as team management.\n\nMonday’s report states that sexual misconduct and abuse was far more widespread than just one coach or incident, but centers on allegations of sexual misconduct by coaches Riley, Rory Dames and Christy Holly, and the alleged failure of executives to investigate or act.The report further states that while their findings focus on the three named coaches, the three were “not the only coaches who mistreated players.”\n\nPaul Riley\n\nPaul Riley was fired by the North Carolina Courage after The Athletic cited players on the record alleging that for years, Riley used his influence and power to sexually harass players and in one incident, coerce a player into having sex with him.\n\n“Paul Riley’s abuse was prolonged and wide-ranging. It spanned multiple leagues, teams, and players. It included emotional misconduct, abuse of power, and sexual misconduct,” the report says. Before coaching the Courage, Riley had coached two other NWSL teams – the Portland Thorns and the Western New York Flash.\n\nInvestigators found that Riley’s conduct was “generally ignored or accepted” until The Athletic reports emerged.\n\nThe report corroborated accounts made by players to The Athletic, and “found evidence that they were not alone.”\n\nThe report found that in 2015, a player reported Riley to the Portland Thorns and the league for sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter a one-week investigation, the Thorns terminated him citing “violations of several provisions of Riley’s employment contract for cause,” including “gross negligence or wilful misconduct” in performing his duties, Yates found, citing a letter from Thorns’ general manager.\n\nThe Thorns did not make this information public, the Yates report found, instead saying that Riley would “not be retained” for the 2016 season and thanked him for his service. Soon afterwards, Riley took another coaching job in the league.\n\nIn response to The Athletic’s 2021 reporting, Riley responded to a list of questions about his alleged conduct with an email where he stated that the majority of the allegations are “completely untrue.”\n\nChristy Holly\n\nChristy Holly was fired from Racing Louisville after the team determined that he had engaged in long-term and egregious sexual misconduct against a player, according to the report – though at the time, the team merely said they fired him “for cause.”\n\nHolly’s behavior, which allegedly began before his stint at Racing Louisville and carried on in the time he spent with the team, included unwanted sexual contact, coercive text messages, abuse of power, and retaliation, according to the report.\n\nOne player who trained with Holly during her off-season, Erin Simon, according to the report, said Holly sent her inappropriate texts, including photographs of his penis and a video of himself masturbating, and asked her to send sexual pictures and a video of herself back, which she said she felt “guilted” into doing, with Holly constantly telling her to “loosen up,” and insisting that having “fun” with him would improve her performance on the field.\n\nWhen he was her coach at Racing Louisville, Simon said that Holly invited her to his house to watch game film, but instead showed her pornography, touched her, told her he wanted to have a threesome with her and another former player, and masturbated in front of her, forcing her to touch his penis, Yates’ report says.\n\nAccording to the report, in another incident, after being called over by Holly to watch game footage together, Simon recalled that during this session, Holly told her he was going to touch her “for every pass [she] f**ked up.” Simon said that he pushed his hands down her pants and up her shirt as she tried to cross her legs and push him away, laughing in the meantime so as not to anger him.\n\nCNN has been unable to reach Holly for comment.\n\nAccording to the report, Holly admitted that he lost his job at Louisville due to his “unique” relationship with Erin Simon.\n\n“He admitted to texting Simon, including sending and soliciting sexual photos. But he denied that any sexual conduct continued at Racing Louisville,” the report added.\n\nRacing Louisville FC said in a statement Wednesday that the Yates report “served as a harsh reminder that appointing Christy Holly as Racing Louisville FC’s first coach was a mistake. We have learned from that mistake, and we apologize to Erin Simon, to our players past and present and to our fans,” they added.\n\nThey added “while our former coach was terminated within 24 hours of us being alerted to the behavior, we know that wasn’t enough and that we failed our locker room by creating a space where this behavior could occur.\n\n“We have worked hard every day since then to ensure a safe environment that puts players in a position to succeed. This includes implementation of club-wide anonymous reporting services and a re-evaluated hiring process for staff.”\n\nRory Dames\n\nIn the report, Yates noted that while Dames had a reputation for developing successful players and teams, he was “equally renowned for his tirades against the young girls who played for him.”\n\nDames was the former head coach for the Chicago Red Stars and is the current owner and former president and coach of the Eclipse Select Soccer Club, an elite youth soccer organization of boys’ and girls’ teams in suburban Chicago.\n\nThe report concludes that “Dames created a sexualized team environment and verbally and emotionally abused players and staff,” and allegedly “made inappropriate sexual and suggestive remarks to youth female players, asked about their boyfriends and sex lives, and sought information about their personal lives.”\n\nOne player’s allegations “recounted an instance where Dames gave her a ride after practice and ‘ask[ed] me all kinds of questions about sex … and wouldn’t take me home until I answered the questions,’” while another alleged Dames would “give girls tips on sex” and say things like: “you should be shaved and bare down there,” and “I hope you are giving your boyfriend a good time.”\n\nA sports psychologist asserted that Dames created “a culture of fear” and was emotionally and verbally abusive, with players describing him as “condescending,” “manipulative,” “aggressive,” “insulting,” and “an intimidator,” the report noted.\n\nDames denies engaging in any misconduct as a coach, sexual or otherwise, according to his lawyer.\n\n“He will address the misstatements of fact and false and defamatory statements in the report but his hands are tied at this time as U.S. Soccer referred all of the matters in the Yates’ report to SafeSport. Upon advice of counsel, Mr. Dames has declined to discuss these matters publicly in any detail,” said his lawyer.\n\nAbuse was widespread\n\nThe damning report found that verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct – had become systemic in the NWSL, with many teams and coaches implicated, and with numerous victims.\n\n“Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women’s soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players.”\n\nThis, investigators noted, was worsened because league owners and the federation “did not institute the most basic of workplace protections.”\n\nThe report was led by former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates, and was based on more than 200 interviews. Steven Senne/AP\n\nFor most of the league’s existence, it has had no anti-harassment policy, no anti-retaliation policy and no anti-fraternization policy, the scathing report noted.\n\nMeanwhile, for the most part, the league did not have ways for players to report inappropriate behavior, while teams generally lacked human resource departments and didn’t perform adequate checks when hiring coaches.\n\nNational Women’s Soccer League commissioner Jessica Berman issued a statement Tuesday saying the league is committed to “implementing reform and disciplinary action” based on the Yates report and the findings of the league and union’s ongoing investigation.\n\n“We have asked the Joint Investigative Team to consider the recommendations set forth in the Yates Report when making their recommendations to the NWSL. Moreover, we have asked the Joint Investigative Team to review – and investigate as necessary – the findings in the Yates Report when concluding their report,” the NWSL added in a statement sent to CNN Thursday.\n\nOwners, executives and coaches failed to act on years of reports\n\nThe report noted that high-ups in soccer failed to properly investigate or make public reports of abuse by coaches, allowing them to move to other teams.\n\n“Teams, the League, and the Federation not only repeatedly failed to respond appropriately when confronted with player reports and evidence of abuse, they also failed to institute basic\n\nmeasures to prevent and address it, even as some leaders privately acknowledged the need for workplace protections,” the report noted.\n\n“As a result, abusive coaches moved from team to team, laundered by press releases thanking them for their service, and positive references from teams that minimized or even concealed misconduct. Those at the NWSL and USSF in a position to correct the record stayed silent.\n\n“In general, teams, the NWSL, and USSF appear to have prioritized concerns of legal exposure to litigation by coaches—and the risk of drawing negative attention to the team or League—over player safety and well-being,” the report noted.\n\nCNN has reached out to U.S. Soccer and the NWSL for comment on these specific allegations.\n\nU.S. Soccer referred CNN to its previous statements, where it committed to addressing the report’s recommendations and said it would, among many steps, establish a new Office of Participant Safety to oversee U.S. Soccer’s conduct policies and reporting mechanisms; publish soccer records from SafeSport’s centralized disciplinary database to publicly identify individuals in the sport who have been disciplined, suspended or banned; and mandate a uniform minimum standard for background checks for all U.S. Soccer members at every level of the game.\n\nSome teams didn’t fully cooperate with the report\n\nIn her report, Yates noted that some teams didn’t fully cooperate with investigators, despite releasing statements which suggested otherwise.\n\n“The Portland Thorns interfered with our access to relevant witnesses and raised specious legal arguments in an attempt to impede our use of relevant documents,” the report noted.\n\nAllegations of abuse have ilicited an angry reactions from fans.

We are horrified and heartbroken and frustrated and exhausted. And we are really, really angry. We are angry that it took a third-party investigation,” Sauerbrunn stated at the beginning of a scheduled press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe two-time World Cup winner added that “people in authority and decision-making positions have repeatedly failed to protect us.”\n\nSauerbrunn, a 10-year NWSL veteran who is in her third season with the Portland Thorns, continued, “Every owner and executive and US Soccer official who repeatedly failed the players and failed to protect the players, who have hidden behind legalities and have not participated fully in these investigations, should be gone.\n\n“At the bare minimum, the recommendations that are in the Sally Yates report should be immediately implemented by US Soccer and by the league (NWSL).”\n\nFan groups for the Portland Thorns and the men’s team, the Portland Timbers, say they have suspended ties with the two teams in response to the revelations made about team management in the report.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, the supporter groups known collectively as 107IST, said “While we were prepared for the worst, nothing prepared us for what was contained in the USSF/ Sally Yates report.\n\n“It’s time to build a bonfire,” they said, calling for changes in key leadership positions.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe league said Monday it would review the findings, and that its own investigation in conjunction with the players’ union is ongoing. That investigation is expected to be released in November.\n\nNational Women’s Soccer League commissioner Jessica Berman issued a statement Tuesday updating the status of a joint investigation being conducted by the league and players union (NWSLPA) after owners of the Portland Thorns and Chicago Red Stars each said they would step back from their respective clubs.\n\nBoth franchises are named in the report. “The NWSL is supportive of the important steps taken by the Portland Thorns and Chicago Red Stars today,” Berman said in a written statement.\n\nShe also said the league is committed to “implementing reform and disciplinary action” based on the Yates report and the findings of the league and union’s ongoing investigation.\n\n“While it will take time, we are fully prepared to take the necessary steps to protect the health and safety of our players, staff and other stakeholders in order to create the League that our players, fans, partners and staff deserve and expect,” she said.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/football/megan-rapinoe-uswnt-abuse-report-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Megan Rapinoe on systemic abuse and misconduct in women's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS Women’s National Team (USWNT) star Megan Rapinoe reiterated that women soccer players are angry and exhausted following an independent investigation report which found systemic abuse and misconduct within women’s professional soccer.\n\nReleased on Monday, the report – led by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates – was based on more than 200 interviews and reveals the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) under the US Soccer Federation (USSF) failed to provide a safe environment for players.\n\n“As sick as this sounds, I feel like we are used to having to take on so much more than game planning and tactics.

Eight were men.\n\nOPINION:Thorns, Red Stars owners need to go in light of damning report on abuse in NWSL\n\nThe report from the independent investigation contained more than 300 pages detailing allegations and recommending actions for the league and U.S. Soccer.\n\nHere’s what we know about the investigation and lack of player protection in the NWSL:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn September 2021, The Athletic reported former NWSL players Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim alleged their former coach, Paul Riley, sexually harassed and coerced players for a decade. Riley denied the reports, but was quickly fired from his team in North Carolina. A few days later, NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird resigned.\n\nThere were reported incidents against other coaches in the league prior to the public allegations against Riley — including the firing of Washington Spirit coach Richie Burke after allegations of verbal and emotional abuse and Racing Louisville FC coach Christy Holly — and a league-wide chain reaction followed.\n\nTwo days after the public reports of Riley's misconduct, U.S. Soccer hired Yates and King & Spalding LLP to conduct an independent investigation.\n\nThe investigation focused on three former coaches, Riley, Holly and Rory Dames of the Chicago Red Stars.\n\nThe investigation’s findings started with recounting an April 2021 encounter between Holly and a player, Erin Simon, who now plays in Europe. Holly invited her to watch game film with him and allegedly told her that for every pass she messed up, he was going to touch her. Simon told investigators Holly “pushed his hands down her pants and up her shirt.”\n\nThe report also described allegations that Dames screamed profanities, questioned sex lives and asked for massages from youth players during his time as coach of the Eclipse Select Soccer Club.\n\n\"We heard report after report of relentless, degrading tirades; manipulation that was about power, not improving performance; and retaliation against those who attempted to come forward,\" the report said. \"Even more disturbing were the stories of sexual misconduct. Players described a pattern of sexually charged comments, unwanted sexual advances and sexual touching, and coercive sexual intercourse.\"\n\nIn addition to allegations of abuse and misconduct by coaches, the report also stated that in certain situations teams covered up abuse reported by players, specifically in the case of Riley and his team at the time, the Portland Thorns. Some allegations date to the inception of the league in 2012.\n\nLast fall, players from NJ/NY Gotham FC, Spirit, NC Courage and Racing Louisville stopped six minutes into their games, linking arms in a circle at midfield. It was a league-wide protest of the failure to protect players.\n\n\"The reckoning has already begun,” the NWSL Players Association said in a statement on Oct. 6, 2021. “We will not be silent. We will be relentless in our pursuit of a league that deserves the players in it.\"\n\nWhat did the report find?\n\nSummary of Findings:\n\nFrom the League’s inception, teams, the NWSL, and USSF failed to put in place basic measures for player safety.\n\nAbuse in the NWSL was systemic.\n\nAbusive coaches moved from team to team, and even to U.S. Soccer, because teams, the League, and U.S. Soccer failed to identify and inform others of coaches’ misconduct.\n\nA culture of abuse, silence, and fear of retaliation perpetuated the misconduct.\n\nPlayers lacked job security and protection from retaliation, further chilling reports of misconduct.\n\nAbuse in women’s professional leagues appears rooted in youth soccer.\n\nThe investigation included more than 200 interviews with current and former players, coaches, owners and fronts office staff. U.S. Soccer also provided documents and Yates' firm reviewed 89,000 deemed likely to be relevant.\n\n\"Our investigation has revealed a league in which abuse and misconduct — verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct — had become systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches, and victims,\" the report said. \"Abuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women’s soccer, beginning in youth leagues, that normalizes verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players.\"\n\nNot all teams were forthcoming during the investigation. The Portland Thorns \"interfered\" with access to \"relevant witnesses and raised specious legal arguments in an attempt to impede\" use of relevant documents. Racing Louisville FC refused to produce documents and did not permit witnesses and the Chicago Red Stars delayed the process of presenting necessary documents.\n\nFurthermore, the investigation found a repeated failure by teams, the NWSL and U.S. Soccer to \"respond appropriately when confronted with player reports and evidence of abuse,\" as well as a failure to \"institute basic measures to prevent and address\" such behaviors.\n\nWhat's next for the NWSL?\n\nYates provided a list of recommendations for the league and federation moving forward. While under the current organization structure U.S. Soccer has limited control over individual teams, the federation does have oversight of the league. Yates recommended the NWSL take responsibility of the teams and U.S. Soccer step in when necessary.\n\nRecommendations from Yates:\n\nTeams should be required to accurately disclose misconduct to the NWSL and U.S. Soccer\n\nto ensure that abusive coaches do not move from team to team.\n\nU.S. Soccer should require meaningful vetting of coaches and, when necessary, use its\n\nlicensing authority to hold wrongdoers accountable.\n\nU.S. Soccer should require the NWSL to conduct timely investigations into allegations of\n\nabuse, impose appropriate discipline, and immediately disseminate investigation\n\noutcomes.\n\nU.S. Soccer should adopt uniform and clear policies and codes of conduct that apply to all\n\nOrganization Members and are found in single place on USSF’s website.\n\nU.S. Soccer, the NWSL, and teams should each designate an individual within their\n\norganizations who is responsible for player safety.\n\nU.S. Soccer should strengthen player safety requirements in professional leagues.\n\nU.S. Soccer should require the NWSL to implement a system to annually solicit and act on\n\nplayer feedback.\n\nU.S. Soccer should collaborate with its youth member organizations and other stakeholders\n\nto examine whether additional measures are necessary to protect youth players\n\nThe NWSL should determine whether discipline is warranted in light of these findings and the findings of the NWSL/NWSLPA Joint Investigation.\n\nWhat is the response from players, NWSL and US Soccer?\n\nIn response, U.S. Soccer said Monday, it \"will immediately 1) establish a new national Office of Participant Safety, 2) publish soccer records from SafeSport’s Centralized Disciplinary Database, and 3) mandate a uniform minimum standard for background checks for all U.S. Soccer members.\"\n\nU.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone also issued a statement.\n\n\"As a former player, as a coach, as the president of soccer’s national governing body, I am heartbroken by the contents of the report, which make clear that systemic changes are needed at every level of our game,\" Parlow Cone said. \"The abuse described in the report is entirely inexcusable and has no place in soccer, on or off the field. Along with everyone at U.S. Soccer, I am squarely focused on the changes we will make to address the report’s findings and make soccer safer for everyone.\"\n\nDuring a press conference ahead of the US game against England, Thorns defender Becky Sauerbrunn said players \"are not doing well.\"\n\n\"We are horrified and heartbroken and frustrated and exhausted, and really, really angry,\" Sauerbrunn said. \"We are angry that it took a third party investigation. We are angry that it took an article in The Athletic and the Washington Post and numerous others. We're angry that it took over 200 people sharing their trauma to get to this point right now.\n\n\"For so long, this has always fallen on the player to demand change. And that is because the people in authority and decision-making positions have repeatedly failed to protect us, and they have failed to hold themselves and each other accountable. And what and who are you actually protecting? And what values are you upholding? You have failed in your stewardship. And it's my opinion that every owner and executive and U.S. Soccer official who has repeatedly failed the players and failed to protect the players ... should be gone.\"\n\nOn Monday, the NWSL said it was immediately reviewing the report. The league and the NWSL Players Association are also conducting an investigation.\n\n\"We recognize the anxiety and mental strain that these pending investigations have caused and the trauma that many — including players and staff — are having to relive,\" the league statement said. \"Establishing trust and confidence between the League, its players, and other key stakeholders remains a central focus for the NWSL, and we know that we must learn from and take responsibility for the painful lessons of the past in order to move the League into a better future.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/football/orlando-pride-coaches-dismissed-intl-spt/index.html", "title": "Orlando Pride head coach and assistant coach fired after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWomen’s professional soccer team Orlando Pride head coach Amanda Cromwell and first assistant coach Sam Greene have been dismissed for “engaging in retaliatory conduct” towards players who they believed had made or supported misconduct allegations against them, the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) announced Monday.\n\nThis comes just a week after a bombshell independent report found systemic abuse and misconduct within women’s professional soccer in the United States, including a failure by the NWSL, under the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), to provide a safe environment for players.\n\nIn March, an investigation by counsel to the Orlando Pride was launched into allegations of verbal abuse and improper favoritism towards players by Cromwell, and allegations of improper favoritism towards players by Greene, the NWSL said.\n\nThe investigation led to written warning for both coaches, the NWSL said in an outline of the investigation.\n\nIn May, the Joint Investigative Team of the league and its players association (NWSLPA) received reports that Cromwell and Greene were engaging in retaliatory conduct towards players they suspected of initiating, participating in, and who were supporting the original investigation.\n\nA second investigation by the NWSL/NWSLPA Joint Investigative Team found that Cromwell and Greene behaved in a way that “discouraged reporting and fostered a general fear of retaliation,” including seeking to waive or trade players, the league said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe league has terminated their contracts, effective immediately, according to Orlando Pride chairman Mark Wilf.\n\nThe league and players association’s investigation also found that goalkeeper coach Aline Reis did not fully cooperate with the investigation, and was “pressuring players to share favorable information with investigators.”\n\nMeanwhile, the entire Pride organization will undergo mandatory training regarding retaliation, discrimination, harassment, and bullying, the NWSL added.\n\nCromwell, Greene, Reis and Assistant Coach Michelle Akers raised complaints that they were subjected to various forms of misconduct – claims a third party investigator found were “unsubstantiated,” the NWSL added.\n\nCromwell responded to the news calling the investigation “biased and incomplete,” adding that her “character and integrity have been mischaracterized.”\n\n“There is no doubt that there has been a culture of abuse in the NWSL. I acknowledge the importance of due process and the need for the NWSL to investigate all claims.\n\n“However, the abusive behavior in the NWSL goes beyond just the players. All of the women on my coaching staff have raised serious concerns about the work environment and I will be reviewing all legal options,” she said.\n\nCromwell and Greene are ineligible to work in the NWSL in any capacity unless or until approved by the Commissioner.\n\nReis has been placed on unpaid administrative leave until she completes a series of steps to be reinstated, the NWSL said.

The NWSL will mandate league and team staff \"who regularly interact with players\" undergo SafeSport training, along with background checks and additional screening.\n\nFormer players Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim went on record with The Athletic detailing the trauma they experienced while playing under Riley.

(AP) — Following the resignation of the National Women’s Soccer League commissioner amid a sexual harassment and misconduct scandal involving a longtime coach, a three-woman executive committee has been formed to oversee league operations.\n\nThe NWSL also launched an independent investigation Sunday into its handling of abuse claims. The league was rocked this week when two former players came forward with allegations of harassment, including sexual coercion, against North Carolina Courage coach Raul Riley.\n\nRiley was immediately fired by the Courage, and both FIFA and U.S. Soccer opened investigations into why he was able to continue coaching even after the players brought their concerns to the league.\n\nThe NWSL called off its games this weekend and Baird stepped down Friday night.\n\nThe league’s board of governors appointed an executive committee made up of Amanda Duffy, Angie Long and Sophie Sauvage to oversee the front office until a new commissioner is named.\n\n“On behalf of the entire league, we are heartbroken for what far too many players have had to endure in order to simply play the game they love, and we are so incredibly sorry,” the three said in a joint statement Sunday. “We understand that we must undertake a significant systemic and cultural transformation to address the issues required to become the type of league that NWSL players and their fans deserve and regain the trust of both.”\n\nThe league retained an outside firm to investigate allegations and report to the executive committee. The investigation includes the claims against Riley as well as all other historical complaints of discrimination, harassment or abuse.\n\nThe NWSL, in its ninth year, also said it was conducting an independent review of practices and policies among its teams. Additionally, comprehensive policies and procedures would be adopted to ensure “a systematic, transparent, and effective execution of any harassment or workplace conduct issues.”\n\nA secure and anonymous reporting platform was set up so that players and staff can report misconduct.\n\nWhile the NWSL games this weekend were called off, in Portland supporters set off smoke bombs in the 25th minute of the Major League Soccer match between the Portland Timbers and Inter Miami. A large sign was displayed that read: Believe, support and protect NWSL players.”\n\nSupporters were also scheduled to rally on Sunday night in Seattle outside Lumen Field, where the Sounders were set to play the Colorado Rapids.\n\nU.S. Soccer suspended Riley’s coaching license Thursday after The Athletic published claims of abuse made by former NWSL players Sinead Farrelly and Mana Shim.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA and U.S. Soccer both announced they were opening investigations into the allegations against Paul Riley. On Sunday, U.S. Soccer released a statement to announce that it has retained Sally Q. Yates of King & Spalding LLP to lead an independent investigation into allegations of abusive behavior and sexual misconduct in women’s professional soccer.\n\nThe alleged harassment of Farrelly started in 2011 when she was a player with the Philadelphia Independence of the now-defunct Women’s Professional Soccer league.\n\nShe told the website that harassment continued when she was with the Portland Thorns. Shim, a former Thorns player, also allegedly experienced harassment. The Thorns said Thursday that the team investigated claims about Riley and passed those on to the league when he was dismissed.\n\nRiley told The Athletic the allegations were “completely untrue.”\n\nRiley was head coach of the Thorns in 2014 and 2015. After he was let go by the Thorns, he became head coach of the Western New York Flash for a season before the team was sold and moved to North Carolina.\n\nBaird became commissioner of the NWSL in February, 2020, after serving as chief marketing officer of the United States Olympic Committee.

Announcements on new sanctions, NATO force posture and military assistance are all expected at the sessions today, according to US and European officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but US and NATO officials have said that option is not on the table because it would risk provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin and spark a wider war with Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN that Putin has still not achieved his goal in Ukraine, which is to eliminate the country’s military potential. Separately, Russia partially reopened its stock market today after a monthlong closure and investors took part in a highly restricted trading session. The White House, however, called the market reopening a “charade.”\n\n2. United Nations\n\nSupreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson concluded her two days of questioning late yesterday, having spent about 22 hours this week being grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Throughout the hearings, Jackson has defended her experience and credentials as she faced criticism from Republican senators on her judicial philosophy and legal record. No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, but many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to vote on Judge Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination on Monday, April 4. In a 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker to put Jackson on the high court.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See what is was like in Toyko when North Korea fired missile over Japan 02:40 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Congress\n\nThe CEOs of 10 airlines and cargo carriers are urging Biden to end mask mandates and Covid-19 testing requirements for international travelers. In a letter to the president, the CEOs argue that federal travel restrictions – including international predeparture testing and the federal mask mandate – “are no longer aligned with the realities of the current epidemiological environment.” Earlier this month, the White House moved the end of the transportation mask mandate to April 18 and said government agencies would consult with the CDC to determine if the mandate could expire sooner. The CEOs of Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Atlas Air Worldwide, Delta Air Lines, FedEx Express, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and UPS Airlines all signed the letter.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These are the Oath Keepers on trial for seditious conspiracy 03:58 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Trump revelations\n\nSeveral recent revelations have shed light on then-President Trump and his supporters’ plans to subvert the Constitution and keep him in power after the 2020 election. These revelations are likely to be of high interest to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. For instance, a newly revealed memo shows a conservative lawyer working with Trump’s legal team tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could overturn the election results on January 6 when Congress counted the Electoral College votes. The six-step scheme, which included throwing out electors from seven states, was outlined in a two-page memo obtained by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa for their book, “Peril.” The memo was then obtained by CNN.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nBritain’s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are on a weeklong royal tour of the Caribbean, having arrived Tuesday hours after protests were held calling on the monarchy to apologize and pay reparations for its historical role in the slave trade. Prince William and Kate are visiting Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas for a series of engagements to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s platinum jubilee year, marking 70 years on the throne. However, protests have overshadowed the trip and a royal engagement was canceled amid reported opposition from local residents. Britain and Jamaica’s relationship stretches back centuries. The island was seized by the British in 1655 and remained under its rule until it gained independence in 1962 but has stayed under the Queen as head of state.

The toy was left to float around the cabin, signaling that the crew had entered weightlessness.\n\nEinstein, who first conceptualized the Theory of Relativity, had the “happiest thought of his entire life” when he realized that a “person in freefall can feel their own weight,” Cassada explained in a dispatch from the Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\n“We live in the same world, we live in the same universe. Sometimes we experience it in a very different way from our neighbors. We can all keep that in mind … and continue to do amazing things,” Cassada said, and Kikina could be seen pumping her fist as he spoke. “And do it together.”\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, October 5.

JIM Watson/AFP/Getty Images Photographers set up remote cameras on Tuesday to capture the SpaceX rocket. Terry Renna/AP Prev Next\n\nDubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station.\n\nThe spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann not only became the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. She’s also serving as mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission.\n\nWhat’s more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist — at least for now.\n\nThe Crew Dragon spacecraft is now on a slow, precise trek to the ISS, which orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s notable about this flight?\n\nLaunching NASA astronauts to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is nothing new. The space agency collaborated with SpaceX for years to transition the task of shuttling people to and from the space station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nWith the return of astronaut launches from US soil, SpaceX has offered a stage for several historic firsts. The Crew-4 Dragon mission, for example, carried NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, the first Black woman ever to join the ISS crew.\n\nOn this flight, Mann, a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley Reservation, became the first Native American woman ever to travel to orbit.\n\n“I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,” Mann told reporters before launch. “I think it’s important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have.”\n\nIn her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple of women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with Crew Dragon spacecraft sat at launch pad 39A on October 3 as preparations continued for the Crew-5 mission.

Kikina’s flight comes just weeks after NASA’s Dr. Frank Rubio launched to the ISS aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz capsule.\n\n“I really love my crewmates,” Kikina told reporters after she arrived at the Florida launch site on Saturday. “I really feel good, comfortable. … We will do our job the best way: happy.”\n\nDuring a post-launch news conference, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership.\n\n“We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,” Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meet up in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the United States and Russia. “Now we continue that.”\n\nREAD MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream\n\nWho are the other astronauts on board?\n\nMann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his “closest friends on the planet.”\n\nAs with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina.\n\nFor veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA’s space shuttle and Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission.\n\n“I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,” he recalled during an August press conference. “It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home.”\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nAfter reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-4 mission back home.\n\nThen the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station’s exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,” according to NASA.\n\nCrew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2022/01/26/elon-musks-spacex-rocket-space-junk-hit-moon/9230274002/", "title": "Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket to hit dark side of the moon in March", "text": "The second stage of a SpaceX rocket is expected to impact the moon on March 4.\n\nThe rocket, launched in February 2015, sent the Deep Space Climate Observatory into space.\n\nWithout power, the remaining rocket has been in orbit but is due to collide with the moon.\n\nPart of a SpaceX rocket launched in February 2015 is projected to crash into the dark side of the moon in five weeks.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Feb. 11, 2015, took the $340 million Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) into space.\n\nFour months later, the DSCOVR satellite reached its destination, more than 620,000 miles from Earth, where it continues to send back images daily and track solar storms. The idea for the mission was originally conceived by then-Vice President Al Gore.\n\nBut space observers have recently gotten caught up in the ultimate outcome of the Falcon 9 rocket that got DSCOVR into orbit.\n\nSince the rocket's second stage did not have enough fuel to return to Earth or escape \"the Earth-Moon system … it has been following a somewhat chaotic orbit since February 2015,\" wrote Eric Berger, a meteorologist and senior space editor at tech news website Ars Technica, earlier this week.\n\nHe cited projections from Bill Gray, who created software astronomers use to track asteroids, comets and near-Earth objects., on the rocket's course to impact the far side of the moon, potentially on March 4.\n\nElon Musk's Neuralink:Project plans to implant chips in human brains to treat neural disorders\n\nCapsized boat:Body found as 'dire' search off Florida continues for 38 people: What we know\n\nGray said on his Project Pluto site that he is \"100% certain\" the rocket will hit the moon at that time on March 4, but added that \"space junk can be a little tricky.\"\n\nIn the coming month, additional observations will help 'refine the prediction\" and \"bring the uncertainty down greatly,\" Gray wrote.\n\nThe prediction is accurate and NASA is monitoring the trajectory of the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, Karen Fox, NASA's senior science communications officer, said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"On its current trajectory, the second stage is expected to impact the far side of the Moon on March 4, 2022,\" she said.\n\nNASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) won't be able to monitor the March 4 impact in real-time, Fox said. \"However, the mission team is assessing if observations can be made to any changes to the lunar environment associated with the impact and later identify the crater formed by the impact,\" she said. \"This unique event presents an exciting research opportunity.\"\n\nNASA hopes to use the orbiter's cameras to find the impact site and compare before and after images. \"The search for the impact crater will be challenging and might take weeks to months,\" Fox said.\n\nSpaceX – selected by NASA to convey the next Americans to land on the moon – did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe March 4 impact cannot be observed from Earth, since it will occur on the far side of the moon (it's not really dark, it's just that we can't see it from Earth). Still, scientists could possibly learn something by later investigating the rocket's impact.\n\n\"This is a rare occurrence, but we have intentionally impacted the moon with rocket upper stages in the past with Apollo missions and with the NASA LCROSS mission, and with various spacecraft,\" said Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society and manager of its LightSail Program. \"To my knowledge, this is the first accidental impact.\"\n\nTalk about the impact has apparently led to some concerns on social media about it potentially changing the moon's orbit, which Gray attempted to tamper down.\n\nSure, the rocket weighs about four tons and will be traveling at more than 5,700 miles per hour. However, he noted, \"the moon is fairly routinely hit with larger objects moving in the ballpark of 10-20\" kilometers per second, which is more than three times as fast as the SpaceX rocket will be traveling.\n\n\"Hence, the craters,\" Gray said. \"It's well-built to take that sort of abuse.\"\n\nHarvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell tweeted that the collision \"is interesting, but not a big deal.\"\n\nHowever, in his Jonathan's Space Report blog, he noted that the attention might bring attention to a growing space junk situation.\n\n\"This is not 'SpaceX did something bad' – it's perfectly standard practice to abandon stuff in deep orbit – this is 'none of the space agencies care about leaving stuff out beyond the Moon',\" McDowell wrote.\n\n\"Traffic in deep space is increasing. And it's not just the USA and the USSR sending stuff to deep space, it's many countries and even commercial companies like SpaceX,\" he wrote. \"So I think it's time for the world to get more serious about regulating and cataloging deep space activity.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2022/05/18/spacex-rocket-races-sunrise-launch-starlink-internet-satellites/9819603002/", "title": "SpaceX rocket races sunrise to launch Starlink internet satellites", "text": "Space is important to us and that’s why we're working to bring you top coverage of the industry and Florida launches.

The 53 satellites packed into the payload fairing will spend the coming weeks slowly raising their orbits to a final destination of about 350 miles above Earth.\n\nAfter a flight toward the northeast, the rocket's first stage also completed a successful landing on the Shortfall of Gravitas drone ship. SpaceX has recovered boosters 121 times since the first in December 2015.\n\nIf it can sustain the current pace, SpaceX could have 3,000 operational Starlink satellites in orbit before the end of the year.\n\nMore:What was in the sky?

SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule was also chosen.\n\nStarliner's flight is a re-do of a December 2019 attempt that failed to reach the ISS due to a mix of software and hardware issues. Boeing opted to pay out of its own pocket for a second demo mission, known as Orbital Flight Test 2, that could pave the way for astronauts to fly the capsule for the first time late this year or early next year.\n\nWeather for Atlas V's liftoff, according to a Space Force forecast issued Wednesday, is expected to be about 70% \"go.\"\n\nFor the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

Here's everything ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAstra, a startup building small rockets that launch out of rural Alaska, notched its first successful test flight on Friday night, putting a dummy satellite into orbit. The flight sent the company’s stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning.\n\nSpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nThe spacecraft, which separated from the rocket after reaching orbit, is now free flying through orbit and will spend all day Friday slowly maneuvering closer to the ISS, where it’s slated to dock Saturday around 7:45 am ET.\n\nThe trip was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which seeks to book rocket rides, provide all the necessary training, and coordinate flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. It’s all in line with the US government’s and the private sector’s goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond.\n\nOn board this mission, called AX-1, are Michael Lopez-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut turned Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nIt’s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past. Last year, for example, a Russian actress and film crew visited the ISS to film part of a movie in an historic first.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know.\n\nHow much did this all cost?\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.\n\nThe space agency has revealed some details on how much it’ll charge for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFood alone costs $2,000 per day, per person, in space. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day. For each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers another $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million.\n\nWho is flying?\n\nLopez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, is commanding this mission as an Axiom employee.\n\nAx-1 Crew (left to right) Larry Connor, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría, and Eytan Stibbe. Chris Gunn for Axiom Space\n\nFor more about the three paying customers he’s flying alongside, check out our coverage here.\n\nIs it safe to go to the ISS, given the Russia conflict?\n\nRussia is the United States’ primary partner on the ISS, and the space station has long been hailed as a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation.\n\nUS-Russian relations on the ground, however, have hit a fever pitch amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and its allies have slapped hefty sanctions on Russia, and the country has retaliated in numerous ways, including by refusing to sell Russian rocket engines to US companies. The head of Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, has even taken to social media to threaten to pull out of the ISS agreement.\n\nDespite all the bluster, NASA has repeatedly sought to reassure that, behind the scenes, NASA and its Russian counterparts are working together seamlessly.\n\n“NASA is aware of recent comments regarding the International Space Station. US sanctions and export control measures continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation on the space station,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a recent statement. “The professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS.”\n\nAre they astronauts or tourists?\n\nThis is a question stewing in the spaceflight community right now.\n\nThe US government has traditionally awarded astronaut wings to anyone who travels more than 50 miles above the Earth’s surface. But commercial astronaut wings — a relatively new designation handed out by the Federal Aviation Administration — might not be handed out quite so liberally.\n\nLast year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022. Now, the FAA plans to simply list the names of everyone who flies above the 50-mile threshold on a website.\n\nWhether it’s fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as “astronauts” is an open question, and countless observers — including NASA astronauts — have weighed in.\n\nNot everyone is too concerned about mincing words.\n\n“If you’re strapping your butt to a rocket, I think that’s worth something,” former NASA astronaut Terry Virts told National Geographic when asked about the issue. “When I was an F-16 pilot, I didn’t feel jealous about Cessna pilots being called pilots. I think everybody’s going to know if you paid to be a passenger on a five-minute suborbital flight or if you’re the commander of an interplanetary space vehicle. Those are two different things.”\n\nIf you ask the AX-1 crew, they don’t love being referred to as “tourists.”\n\n“This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists,” Lopez-Alegría told reporters earlier this month, referring to the brief supersonic flights put on by Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin. “I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThe crew did undergo extensive training for this mission, taking on much of the same tasks as professional astronauts-in-training. But the fact is that the three paying customers on this flight — Stibbe, Pathy, and Connor — weren’t selected from a pool of thousands of applicants and aren’t dedicating much of their lives to the endeavor.\n\nAxiom itself has been more flippant about word usage in the past.\n\n“Commercial human spaceflight. Space Tourism. Whatever you call it — it’s happening. And soon,” the company wrote on its website.\n\nWhat will they do while they’re in space?\n\nEach of the crew members has a list of research projects they plan to work on.\n\nConnor will be doing some research on how spaceflight affects senescent cells, which are cells that have ceased the normal replication process and are “linked to multiple age-related diseases,” according to Axiom. That research will be done in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAmong the items on Pathy’s to-do list is some additional medical research, focused more on children’s health, that he’ll conduct in partnership with several Canadian hospitals, and some conservation-awareness initiatives.\n\nStibbe will also do some research and focus on “educational and artistic activities to connect the younger generation in Israel and around the globe,” according to Axiom. Stibbe is flying on behalf of the Ramon Foundation — a space education non-profit named for Israel’s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. ​Stibbe’s Axiom bio says he and Ramon shared a “close” friendship.\n\nDuring downtime, the crew will also get a chance to enjoy sweeping views of Earth. And, at some point, they’ll share a meal with the other astronauts on board. Their food was prepared in partnership with celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andrés. Their meals “lean on flavors and traditional dishes of Commander López-Alegría’s native Spain,” according to Axiom.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/world/gallery/spacex-nasa-crew-5-launch/index.html", "title": "Photos: SpaceX's historic Crew-5 launch | CNN", "text": "The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, October 5.\n\nSpaceX and NASA launched a crew of astronauts on a trip to the International Space Station on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nDubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station.

But before that, a brief test firing of the rocket's 27 engines is expected sometime next week.\n\n\"Falcon Heavy now vertical on the former Apollo 11 moon rocket launchpad,\" Musk said via Instagram late Thursday while also confirming testing and launch timeframes. \"Excitement on launch day guaranteed, one way or another.\"\n\nDecember 2017:Elon Musk reveals red Tesla Roadster bound for Mars\n\nWhen Falcon Heavy's 27 Merlin engines finally ignite, it will become the most powerful rocket in the world thanks to its 5.1 million pounds of thrust. Only the Apollo era's Saturn V and the space shuttle eclipsed that output.\n\nSecured atop the 230-foot-tall rocket and safely tucked away in a protective payload fairing will be Musk's 2008 Tesla Roadster, an all-electric sports car that boosted his energy company during its formative years. Its destination? Deep space, according to Musk.\n\nAfter liftoff, an aerial ballet of 156-foot-tall Falcon boosters will take place over Space Coast skies as all three first stages target landings — the two side cores at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Landing Zone 1, and the center core on the company's Of Course I Still Love You drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe tandem landings, however, mean local spectators can expect double the sonic boom energy as the boosters cross the speed of sound threshold. And the sight of two boosters returning is likely to impress, too.\n\nMusk's \"one way or another\" comments can be traced back to a Washington, D.C., speech last July during which he said Falcon Heavy is one of the most technically complex and difficult projects SpaceX has ever undertaken.\n\n\"There's a lot of risk associated with Falcon Heavy,\" he said during the 2017 International Space Station Research and Development Conference. \"Real good chance that the vehicle doesn't make it to orbit.

That mission is expected to launch between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. and also will feature a first stage landing about eight minutes after liftoff.\n\nFollow Emre Kelly on Twitter: @EmreKelly\n\nOctober 2016:Florida gives $5M to SpaceX to help launch crews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/world/how-to-watch-artemis-1-launch-scn/index.html", "title": "How to watch the Artemis I mission lift off to the moon", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida through the Monday morning launch. Space correspondents Kristin Fisher and Rachel Crane will bring us moment by moment reporting from the launch along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time in 50 years, a spacecraft is preparing to launch on a journey to the moon.\n\nThe uncrewed Artemis I mission, including the Space Launch System Rocket and Orion spacecraft, is targeting liftoff on August 29 between 8:33 a.m. ET and 10:33 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAlthough there is no human crew aboard the mission, it’s the first step of the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon and eventually land them on Mars\n\nThe weather is looking good for launch. For the beginning of the Monday launch period, the chances of favorable weather have gone up to 80%, according to the 6:45am ET Sunday US Space Force forecast. However, closer to the end of the launch period the chances decrease to 60% as the chance for scattered showers and storms increases.\n\nThe welcome news was announced Sunday, one day after the mega moon rocket experienced multiple lightning strikes while sitting at the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.\n\nTeams worked overnight to assess the potential impacts of the five events recorded by the lightning protection system towers at Launchpad 39B during a thunderstorm Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfter determining that the strikes were likely low magnitude, the team decided that no significant retests were needed and “everything looks really good,” said Jeff Spaulding, Artemis I senior NASA test director.\n\nIf the rocket is unable to launch Monday, the next possible launch would be Friday, September 2 at 12:48pm ET.\n\n.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft will enter a distant retrograde orbit of the moon and travel 40,000 miles beyond it, going further than any spacecraft intended to carry humans. Crews will ride aboard Artemis II on a similar trajectory in 2024, and the first woman and the next man to land on the moon are slated to arrive at the lunar south pole in late 2025 on the Artemis III mission.\n\nThe agency will share live views and coverage in English and Spanish before, during and after the Artemis I launch on its website and on NASA TV. The broadcast will begin at 12 a.m. ET as supercold propellant is loaded into the SLS rocket.\n\nAppearances by celebrities like Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer and performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” by Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock and “America the Beautiful” by The Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma are also part of the program.\n\nOnce the launch has occurred, NASA will conduct a post-launch briefing, and later in the day, the agency will share the first Earth views from cameras aboard the Orion spacecraft.\n\nOrion’s journey will last 42 days as it travels to the moon, loops around it and returns to Earth – traveling a total of 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers). The capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on October 10.\n\nCameras inside and outside of Orion will share images and video throughout the mission, including live views from the Callisto experiment, which will capture a stream of a mannequin called Commander Moonikin Campos sitting in the commander’s seat. If you have an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it about the mission’s location each day.\n\nHere’s everything you can expect before, during and after the launch.\n\nCounting down to launch\n\nThe official launch countdown wbegan on August 27 at 10:23 a.m. ET.\n\nThe call to stations occurred Saturday morning at Kennedy Space Center, as well as for teams offering support from various centers across the country. This is when all of the teams associated with the mission arrived at their consoles and reported that they were ready, kicking off the two-day countdown.\n\nOver the weekend, engineers are powering up the Orion spacecraft, the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (the upper part of the rocket) and core stage, charge batteries and conduct a final preparation for the engines.\n\nLate Sunday night into early Monday morning, the launch team will conduct a briefing to discuss weather conditions and decide if they are “go” or “no go” to begin fueling the rocket.\n\nIf everything looks good, the team will begin fueling the rocket’s core stage eight hours before launch. Five hours before, the upper stage will begin fueling. Afterward, the team will top off and replenish any of the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen that dissipates during the fueling process.\n\nAbout 50 minutes before launch, the final NASA test director briefing will occur. A planned 30-minute countdown hold will start about 40 minutes before launch.\n\nThe launch director will poll the team to make sure that every station is “go” 15 minutes ahead of liftoff.\n\nAt 10 minutes and counting, things kick into high gear as the spacecraft and rocket go through the final steps. Much of the action takes place in the final minute, as the ground launch sequencer sends the command for the rocket flight computer’s automated launching sequencer to take over about 30 seconds prior to launch.\n\nIn the last few seconds, hydrogen will burn off, the four RS-25 engines will start, resulting in booster ignition and liftoff at T minus zero.\n\nJourney to the moon\n\nAfter liftoff, the solid rocket boosters will separate from the spacecraft about two minutes into the flight and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean, with other components also jettisoning shortly after. The core stage of the rocket will separate about eight minutes later and fall toward the Pacific Ocean, allowing for Orion’s solar array wings to deploy.\n\nThe perigree raise maneuver will occur about 12 minutes after launch, when the ICPS experiences a burn to raise Orion’s altitude so it doesn’t reenter the Earth’s atmosphere. Shortly after that is the trans-lunar Injection burn, when the ICPS boosts Orion’s speed from 17,500 miles per hour (28,163 kilometers per hour) to 22,600 miles per hour (36,371 kilometers per hour) to escape the pull of Earth’s gravity and set off for the moon.\n\nAfter this burn, the ICPS will separate from Orion.\n\nAround 4:30 p.m., Orion will make its first outbound trajectory correction burn using the European Service Module, which provides the spacecraft with power, propulsion and thermal control. This maneuver will put Orion on a path to the moon.\n\nThe next few days after launch, Orion will venture out to the moon, coming within 60 miles (96 kilometers) during its closest approach of the lunar surface on day six of the journey – or September 3 if the launch occurs as planned on August 29. The service module will place Orion in a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on day 10, or September 7.\n\nOrion will surpass the distance record of 248,654 miles (400,169 kilometers) – set by Apollo 13 in 1970 – on September 8 when it loops around the moon.

The flight sent the company’s stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning.\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it.\n\nThe four crew members — Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor — left the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Sunday at 9:10 pm EST. But as had happened so often already with this mission, there was one more delay, as the capsule departed 15 minutes past the original planned departure time of 8:55 pm EST, as the capsule occupants dealt with minor communications issues.\n\nThey will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday.\n\nAX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nDuring their first 12 days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that was designed by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.\n\nThe weather delays then afforded to them “a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,” according to Axiom.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details about how much it charges for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFor each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. While in space, food alone costs an estimated $2,000 per day, per person. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.\n\nBut the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won’t add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n“Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,” the statement reads.\n\nIt’s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.\n\nThe 11-person crew aboard the International Space Station on April 9, 2022.

NASA\n\nBut AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS. It’s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.\n\nThe mission has set off yet another round of debate about whether people who pay their way to space should be referred to as “astronauts,” though it should be noted a trip to the ISS requires a far larger investment of both time and money than taking a brief suborbital ride on a rocket built by companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic.\n\nLópez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, had this to say about it: “This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists. I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThough the paying customers will not receive astronaut wings from the US government, they were presented with the “Universal Astronaut Insignia” — a gold pin recently designed by the Association of Space Explorers, an international group comprised of astronauts from 38 countries. López-Alegría presented Stibbe, Pathy and Connor with their pins during a welcome ceremony after the group arrived at the space station.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/china/china-wentian-space-debris-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "title": "Chinese booster rocket debris could fall to Earth early next week ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nThe remnants of the massive Chinese rocket that delivered a new module to its space station on Monday are expected to fall to Earth early next week, according to US Space Command, which is tracking the rocket’s trajectory.\n\nThe 23-ton Long March 5B rocket which carried the Wentian laboratory module, took off from Hainan Island at 2:22 p.m. local time Sunday, July 24, and the module successfully docked with China’s orbital outpost.\n\nIts job completed, the rocket has gone into an uncontrolled descent toward Earth’s atmosphere and it’s not clear where it will land. The uncontrolled descent marks the third time that the country has been accused of not properly handling space debris from its rocket stage.\n\n“It’s a 20-tonne metal object. Although it will break up as it enters the atmosphere, numerous pieces – some of them quite large – will reach the surface,” said Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and author of a recent study on the risk of casualties from space debris.\n\nSpace debris poses an extremely minimal risk to humans, Byers explained, but it’s possible that larger parts could cause damage if it lands in inhabited regions. Byers said that due to the increase in space junk, those small chances are becoming more likely, especially in the global south, according to the research published in the Nature Astronomy journal, with rocket bodies being approximately three times more likely to land at the latitudes of Jakarta, Dhaka and Lagos than those of New York, Beijing or Moscow.\n\n“This risk is entirely avoidable since technologies and mission designs now exist that can provide controlled reentries (usually into remote areas of oceans) instead of uncontrolled and therefore entire random ones,” he said via email.\n\nHolger Krag, the head of the European Space Agency’s Space Debris Office, said international best practice was to conduct a controlled reentry, targeting a remote part of the ocean, whenever the casualty risk is too high.\n\nHe added that the re-entry zone for the rocket was geographically limited to between the latitudes of 41 degrees south and 41 degrees north of the equator.\n\nThe US Space Command said it will track the Chinese rocket’s fall back to Earth, according to a spokesperson.\n\nBased on varying atmospheric conditions, the exact entry point of rocket stage into Earth’s atmosphere “cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry,” the spokesperson said, but it is estimated to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere around August 1.\n\nThe 18th Space Defense Squadron, part of the US military that tracks reentries, will also provide daily updates on its location.\n\nCNN has reached out to the China Manned Space Agency for comment.\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said that space debris weighing more than 2.2 tons is typically brought down to a specific location on its first orbit of Earth.\n\n“The point is that things that big are normally not put in orbit without an active control system,”he said.\n\nWith “no active control system, and no re-startable engine to boost it back down to Earth… it just tumbles along in orbit and eventually burns up due to friction with the atmosphere,” McDowell told CNN.\n\nChina was heavily criticized last year for its handling of space debris after it launched another module on a similar rocket. Its remnants plunged into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives 10 days after the launch.\n\nNASA said China failed to “meet responsible standards.”\n\n“Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at the time.\n\nChina responded to criticisms by blaming the US for “hyping up fears” over the rocket reentry and accused US scientists and NASA of “acting against their conscience” and being “anti-intellectual.”\n\nIn 2020, a Chinese rocket core – which weighed nearly 20 tons – made an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, passing directly over Los Angeles and Central Park in New York City before eventually diving into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSpace junk such as old satellites reenter the Earth’s atmosphere on a daily basis, although most of it goes unnoticed because it burns up long before it can hit the ground.\n\nIt’s only larger space debris – such as spacecraft and rocket parts – that pose a very small risk to humans and infrastructure on the ground.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Katie Hunt Kristin Fisher", "Kathleen Magramo", "Katie Hunt", "Kristin Fisher"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2021/08/29/spacex-breaks-floridas-two-month-drought-launch-iss/5641567001/", "title": "SpaceX breaks Florida's two-month drought with launch to ISS", "text": "Note: We've brought you a front-row seat to Florida space news since 1966. Journalism like ours takes time and resources. Please consider a subscription.\n\n---\n\nSpaceX officially broke Florida's two-month launch drought early Sunday, vaulting a Dragon spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center with thousands of pounds of cargo for astronauts stationed in low-Earth orbit.\n\nFalcon 9 slowly ascended from pad 39A exactly 47 seconds after 3:14 a.m., relying on its nine Merlin main engines to propel Dragon on a trajectory to catch up with the International Space Station some 250 miles overhead. It marked the 23rd run for SpaceX under contract with NASA to deliver supplies, cargo, and science experiments to the ISS.\n\nThe uncrewed capsule should dock with the Harmony module's forward-facing port – the first cargo mission to use that location – around 11 a.m. Eastern time Monday. NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur will oversee the procedure.\n\nA first attempt to fly early Saturday was scrubbed due to storms caused by Hurricane Ida's trek in the Gulf of Mexico. Though there were some scattered showers Sunday, conditions drastically improved to 80% \"go\" just before Dragon took flight toward the northeast atop the 230-foot rocket.\n\nSunday marked the first Florida launch in exactly two months, a drought caused by a variety of factors ranging from the worldwide chip shortage to the reprioritization of liquid oxygen – a critical spaceflight propellant – for COVID-19 patients in hospitals.\n\nNew drone ship's first landing\n\nAbout eight minutes after liftoff, meanwhile, brand new SpaceX hardware stationed in the Atlantic Ocean hosted its first booster landing: the Shortfall of Gravitas drone ship.\n\nFalcon 9's 162-foot first stage successfully landed right in the middle of the flat black ship, which sports modernized features and is more powerful than its Of Course I Still Love You predecessor, according to recent updates from Elon Musk. The latter ship, which has hosted dozens of successful landings since 2016, is undergoing work in California.\n\nShortfall of Gravitas, or ASOG, is expected to return to Port Canaveral with the booster in the next few days, but because it's newer and more powerful, it could arrive faster than expected. It's stationed at the port with Just Read the Instructions, the second SpaceX ship to host successful landings beginning in 2017.\n\nAll told, SpaceX needs at least two ships on the Space Coast. Not only does the planned launch cadence – upwards of 40 a year – demand it, but three-booster Falcon Heavy missions can make use of the flexibility, too. The rocket's two side cores usually return to land at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the center core can be ditched in the ocean or recovered on a drone ship.\n\nLike the two other ships in the fleet, ASOG was named to honor the late science fiction writer Iain M. Banks and is a reference to a spaceship featured in his \"Culture\" series of novels.\n\nThe cargo\n\nPacked into Cargo Dragon were 4,800 pounds of science experiments, essential supplies, and hardware needed aboard the ISS. Aside from critical needs like food and water, seven astronauts and cosmonauts currently aboard will be tasked with managing the experiments.\n\nThey include studies of grape skins and seeds used in winemaking that could someday impact osteoporosis treatments; an implanted drug delivery system that allows for remote-controlled release of treatments; and several Girl Scouts experiments that will study plants, ants, and even brine shrimp in space for the first time.\n\nCargo Dragon usually spends about a month attached to the ISS. Afterward, it will return for splashdown off the coast of Florida with return experiments, unneeded supplies, and waste.\n\nThe next launch\n\nThough the launch drought is broken, timing for the Space Coast's next mission has not yet been determined. If schedules hold and another doesn't squeeze in beforehand, SpaceX is next on the calendar with Inspiration 4, a privately purchased Crew Dragon flight that will include four participants.\n\nThe capsule is expected to take off from KSC's pad 39A no earlier than Sept. 15 with billionaire Jared Isaacman and his crew: healthcare worker Hayley Arceneaux, professor and science communicator Sian Proctor, and engineer Chris Sembroski. This first \"all-civilian space mission\" has also raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, of which Arceneaux is an employee.\n\nThe amount Isaacman paid for the flight has not been disclosed, but he is covering the entire cost of the mission ranging from pre-launch training all the way to tax implications for his crew. He is the founder of and CEO of Shift4 Payments, a payments processing company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nAn exact time for the mission has not been made available, but Isaacman previously said it's almost entirely up to his crew since there's no specific destination in orbit. Spectators should expect liftoff at a reasonable time and not like Sunday's 3:14 a.m. departure.\n\nFor the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

She was 90.\n\nLynn’s family said in a statement to CNN that she died Tuesday at her home in Tennessee.\n\n“Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,” the statement read.\n\nThey asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial will be announced later.\n\nLynn, who had no formal music training but spent hours every day singing her babies to sleep, was known to churn out fully textured songs in a matter of minutes. She just wrote what she knew.\n\nShe lived in poverty for much of her early life, began having kids by age 17 and spent years married to a man prone to drinking and philandering – all of which became material for her plainspoken songs. Lynn’s life was rich with experiences most country stars of the time hadn’t had for themselves – but her female fans knew them intimately.\n\n“So when I sing those country songs about women struggling to keep things going, you could say I’ve been there,” she wrote in her first memoir, “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” “Like I say, I know what it’s like to be pregnant and nervous and poor.”\n\nLynn scored hits with fiery songs like “Don’t Come Home A’ Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ On Your Mind)” and “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),” which topped the country charts in 1966 and made her the first female country singer to write a No. 1 hit.\n\nHer songs recounted family history, skewered lousy husbands and commiserated with women, wives and mothers everywhere. Her tell-it-like-it-is style saw tracks such as “Rated X” and “The Pill” banned from radio, even as they became beloved classics.\n\n“I wasn’t the first woman in country music,” Lynn told Esquire in 2007. “I was just the first one to stand up there and say what I thought, what life was about.”\n\nShe grew up dirt-poor in the Kentucky hills\n\nShe was born Loretta Webb in 1932, one of eight Webb children raised in Butcher Hollow in the Appalachian mining town of Van Lear, Kentucky. Growing up, Lynn sang in church and at home, even as her father protested that everyone in Butcher Hollow could hear.\n\nLoretta Lynn wears a cowboy hat and a fringe western style jacket while holding an acoustic guitar as she poses for a portrait in circa 1960 in Nashville, Tennessee. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nHer family had little money. But those early years were some of her fondest memories, as she recounts in her 1971 hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter”: “We were poor but we had love; That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of.”\n\nAs a young teenager, Loretta met the love of her life in Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn, whom she affectionately called “Doo.” The pair married when Lynn was 15 – a fact cleared up in 2012, after the Associated Press discovered Lynn was a few years older than she had said she was in her memoir – and Lynn gave birth to their first of six children the same year.\n\n“When I got married, I didn’t even know what pregnant meant,” said Lynn, who bore four children in the first four years of marriage and a set of twins years later.\n\n“I was five months pregnant when I went to the doctor, and he said, ‘You’re gonna have a baby.’ I said, ‘No way. I can’t have no baby.’ He said, ‘Ain’t you married?’ Yep. He said, ‘You sleep with your husband?’ Yep. ‘You’re gonna have a baby, Loretta. Believe me.’ And I did.”\n\nThe couple soon headed to Washington state in search of jobs. Music wasn’t a priority for the young mother at first. She’d spend her days working, mostly, picking strawberries in Washington state while her babies sat on a blanket nearby.\n\nBut when her husband heard her humming tunes and soothing their babies to sleep, he said she sounded better than the girl singers on the radio. He bought her a $17 Harmony guitar and got her a gig at a local tavern.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1960 that she’d record what would become her debut single, “Honky Tonk Girl.” She then took the song on the road, playing country music stations across the United States.\n\nAfter years of hard work and raising kids, telling stories with her guitar seemed like a break.\n\nLoretta Lynn performs in 2016 during South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Al Wagner/Invision/AP Prev Next\n\n“Singing was easy,” Lynn told NPR’s Terry Gross in 2010. “I thought ‘Gee whiz, this is an easy job.’ ”\n\nThe success of her first single landed Lynn on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and, soon, a contract with Decca Records. She quickly befriended country star Patsy Cline, who guided her through the fame and fashion of country stardom until her shocking death in a plane crash in 1963.\n\nCline “was my only girlfriend at the time. She took me under her wing, and when I lost her, it was something else. I still miss her to this day,” Lynn told The Denver Post in 2009. “I wrote ‘You Ain’t Woman Enough to Take My Man,’ and she said, ‘Loretta, that’s a damn hit.’ It shocked me, because you don’t expect somebody like Patsy Cline to tell you that you have a hit. Right after she passed, I put the record out, and it was a hit.”\n\nHer best-known songs drew from her life and marriage\n\nLynn’s struggle and success became the stuff of legend, an oft-repeated story of youth, naivete and poverty.\n\nFrom “Fist City” to “You’re Lookin’ at Country,” Lynn always sang from the heart, whether she was telling off a woman interested in Doo or honoring her Appalachian roots. But her music was far from conventional.\n\nShe rankled the conservative country establishment with songs like “Rated X,” about the stigma fun-loving women face after divorce, and “The Pill,” in which a woman toasts her newfound freedom thanks to birth control – “They didn’t have none of them pills when I was younger, or I’d have been swallowing them like popcorn,” Lynn wrote in her memoir.\n\nShe documented her upbringing in the bestselling 1976 memoir “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” co-written with George Vecsey. A 1980 biographical film by the same name won an Academy Award for actress Sissy Spacek and brought Lynn wider fame. Lynn’s success also helped launch the music careers of her sisters, Peggy Sue Wright and Crystal Gayle.\n\nLynn’s legend faced questions in 2012 when The Associated Press reported that in census records, a birth certificate and marriage license, Lynn was three years older than what most biographies stated. It didn’t mar Lynn’s success, but did make the oft-repeated tales of her teen marriage and motherhood less extreme.\n\n“I never, never thought about being a role model,” Lynn told the San Antonio Express-News in 2010. “I wrote from life, how things were in my life. I never could understand why others didn’t write down what they knew.”\n\nLynn always credited her husband with giving her the confidence to first step on stage as a young performer. She also spoke in interviews, and in her music, about the pain he caused over their nearly 50 years of marriage. Doolittle Lynn died in 1996 after years of complications from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nIn her 2002 memoir, “Still Woman Enough,” Lynn wrote that he was an alcoholic who cheated on her and beat her, even as she hit him back. But she stayed with him until his death and told NPR in 2010 that “he’s in there somewhere” in every song she wrote.\n\n“We fought one day and we’d love the next, so I mean … to me, that’s a good relationship,” she told NPR. “If you can’t fight, if you can’t tell each other what you think – why, your relationship ain’t much anyway.”\n\nLynn won numerous awards throughout her career, including three Grammys and many honors from the Academy of Country Music. She earned Grammys for her 1971 duet with Conway Twitty, “After the Fire is Gone,” and for the 2004 album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with Jack White of the White Stripes that introduced her to a new generation of fans.\n\nThen President Barack Obama awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Loretta Lynn in 2013. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nShe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and her song “Coal Miner’s Daughter” was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, and in 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Lynn “gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about.”\n\nHer career and legend only continued to grow in her later years as she recorded new songs, toured steadily and drew loyal audiences well into her 80s. A museum and dude ranch are dedicated to Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.\n\n“Working keeps you young,” she told Esquire in 2007. “I ain’t ever gonna stop. And when I do, it’s gonna be right on stage. That’ll be it.”\n\nLynn was hospitalized in 2017 after suffering a stroke at her home. The following year she broke a hip.

She wrote about intimate matters – from her difficult, wearying childhood to fights with her husband – yet managed to strike a collective nerve.\n\nWithout ever mentioning politics or women’s liberation, her 1960s and 1970s hits helped change long-held notions about gender roles. “Rated ‘X’ ” and “Don’t Come Home A Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)” were personal pleas – not political treatises – that sought an end to double standards.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nLynn did all this at a time when women were most often the voices through which men’s words and melodies were heard. She was Nashville’s first prominent woman to write and record her own material and was one of the first female music stars to generate her own hits.\n\n'What a beautiful soul':Dolly Parton, LeAnn Rimes, more country stars remember Loretta Lynn\n\nWhen she was set to receive her Kennedy Center Honor in 2003, Lynn told The (Nashville) Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, that she wasn’t sure why people found her culture-shaking songs so remarkable.\n\n“Cultural contributions? What’s that?” she asked. “I was just sayin’ it like I was livin’ it. People’d go around that, but I went right through the middle.”\n\nShe was the first woman named entertainer of the year at the genre’s two major awards shows, first by the Country Music Association in 1972 and then by the Academy of Country Music three years later.\n\nIn her 1970 smash hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” Lynn told the story of her upbringing, which helped her reach her widest audience yet.\n\nReview: Loretta Lynn remembers her friendship with Patsy Cline in heartfelt new memoir\n\n“We were poor but we had love / That’s the one thing Daddy made sure of / He shoveled coal to make a poor man’s dollar,” she sang.\n\n“Coal Miner’s Daughter,” also the title of her 1976 book, was made into a 1980 movie of the same name. Sissy Spacek’s portrayal of Lynn won her an Academy Award and the film was also nominated for best picture.\n\nLong after her commercial peak, Lynn won two Grammys in 2005 for her album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with rock star Jack White that featured 13 songs she wrote, including “Portland, Oregon” about a drunken one-night stand.\n\n“She is the single most important female singer-songwriter of the 20th century,” White told The Tennessean at the time.\n\nDolly Parton is in! Now it's time to get these country greats into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nBorn Loretta Webb, the second of eight children, she claimed her birthplace was Butcher Holler, near the coal mining company town of Van Lear in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. There really wasn’t a Butcher Holler, however. She made up the name for the purposes of the song, based on the names of the families that lived there.\n\nBefore Lynn’s ascendance into country music royalty, it wasn’t even on most maps. For Lynn, it was a place of hardship, poverty and danger.\n\nHer father, Ted, worked the night shift at the Consolidated Number Five mine, while her mother, Clara, tended to the eight kids and read books by a kerosene lamp until he came home. In her first autobiography, Lynn looked back on her father’s work as something heroic. “He kept his family alive by breaking his own body down,” she wrote.\n\nHer daddy played the banjo, her mama played the guitar and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family.\n\n'Sorry girls, he's taken now':Loretta Lynn and Kid Rock got 'married' over the weekend\n\nWhen Lynn was 13, she met Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn at a pie supper. He was 21, had served in the Army and already had a reputation for wildness. The two married in January 1948, when she was 15, and he took a job in the coal mine.\n\nTheir union was troubled from the start – he left her for another woman that same year, when Lynn was four months pregnant, then returned before she had their first child – but they remained married until his death in 1996.\n\nHe bought her a Sears & Roebuck guitar as a gift, encouraging her to play and sing, and she always credited him for her career in music. At first, she sounded too much like her idol, Kitty Wells, to be branded an original. But she had talent and conviction, and her blunt, truthful compositions began to set her apart from other female country singers. She wrote her first hit single, “I’m a Honky Tonk Girl,” released in 1960.\n\nThe Lynns drove across the U.S., visiting radio stations in hopes of gaining airplay for the single. (It peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard country singles chart.) When they reached Nashville in the fall, Lynn made a guest appearance on the \"Grand Ole Opry.\" She was 28.\n\nAudience reaction at the Opry was immediately positive, and Nashville saw something different in Lynn: a female singer-songwriter who strayed significantly from the prim, near-Victorian model of the time.\n\nShe scored top 10 hits with “Blue Kentucky Girl” and “Wine, Women and Song,” but it wasn’t until 1966 that she became recognized as a writer of import. In that watershed year, Lynn released “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)” and “Don’t Come Home A Drinkin’.” The former was a prideful rebuke to someone who threatened to bust up a marriage, the latter a strong, funny slice of life. Both were major hits.\n\n“At the time, girl singers were doing I-love-you-truly kinds of things, but I came in fightin’ over my man ’cause he was stepping out with somebody else,” she said in a 1980 \"Penthouse\" magazine interview.\n\nLynn wrote and recorded songs that weighed in on women’s roles in a changing America, including “The Pill,” which celebrated birth control as a sexual and social equalizer. Her songs insisted on something resembling fair play between the sexes, reaching a segment of the female population that found little sense in marches and bra burnings.\n\n“She was burning down walls between men and women,” White said.\n\nLynn also teamed up with singer Conway Twitty to form one of the most popular duos in country music with hits such as “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man” and “After the Fire is Gone,” which earned them a Grammy Award.\n\nShe moved to Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, outside of Nashville, in the 1990s, where she set up a ranch complete with a replica of her childhood home and a museum that is a popular roadside tourist stop.\n\nIn October 2010, Garth Brooks sang with Lynn at a Grammy Awards-sponsored celebration of her 50 years in music.\n\n“You just don’t forget where you come from,” she said at the celebration. “All I do is close my eyes, and I know where I’m from. I go back to that little old one-room cabin where I lived until I was 11.”\n\nHers was an unprecedented story that will be retold but not repeated.\n\n“God gives you life, and you do with it what you want to,” she told The Tennessean. “If you turn out bad, that’s up to you. If you turn out good, that’s up to you, also. But still, from the time I was born, I think he probably held my hand or held me in his arms. Or else I’d have never made it.\n\nContributing: Elise Brisco, USA TODAY, and Kristin M.

Ford’s beyond saving in his 1955 recording, as he’s “sold my soul to the company store.”\n\nDwight Yoakam — “Guitars, Cadillacs”\n\nWhen he found himself in Hollywood with a broken heart and shattered dreams, Yoakam clung to hope with his \"guitars, Cadillacs (and) hillbilly music.\" Soon enough, it made him one of country's biggest stars.\n\nHank Williams Jr. — “Family Tradition”\n\nWhile he explained that he was only following in his dad’s rowdy footsteps, “Bocephus” also truly stepped out of Hank Sr.’s shadow with this 1979 smash.\n\nOak Ridge Boys — \"Elvira\"\n\nGiddy-up! We dare you to name a song that’s more fun to sing than this Oaks “oom-poppa” classic (named after an East Nashville street).\n\nRay Charles — \"You Don't Know Me\"\n\nCharles’ heartbreaking spin on the Eddy Arnold/Cindy Walker song is the pinnacle of his landmark album “Modern Sounds in Country & Western Music.”\n\nKenny Rogers — “The Gambler”\n\nRaise a glass to timeless advice.\n\nLittle Big Town — “Girl Crush”\n\nSome radio programmers were terrified of this 2014 song — in which Karen Fairchild sings of wanting to “taste (the) lips” of the woman who has her love interest’s attention — but listeners, critics and Music Row gave it a full embrace.\n\nLee Brice — “I Drive Your Truck”\n\nBrice’s powerful 2012 hit was inspired by a true story of a father who found comfort in driving the truck once owned by his son, who’d been killed while serving in Afghanistan.\n\nLacy J. Dalton — \"16th Avenue\"\n\nSeveral years after she found country stardom, Dalton made sure to tip her hat to those still chasing their dream on Nashville’s Music Row — aka 16th Avenue South.\n\nPorter Wagoner — “The Green, Green Grass of Home”\n\nBefore Tom Jones, Elvis and dozens of others put their spin on Curly Putman's classic, Wagoner first made it a hit. In a devastating twist, it turns out he's dreaming of his hometown while on death row.\n\nMerle Haggard — “Mama Tried”\n\nA slippy lead guitar, Haggard's sketched storytelling ... California country with \"Mama Tried.\"\n\nRandy Travis — “Forever and Ever, Amen”\n\nTravis lays out his devotion in his signature song, and listeners haven't stopped loving it since its release in 1987.\n\nRoy Acuff — “Wabash Cannonball”\n\nThis folk song about a mighty train had already been passed down for generations when Acuff cut it in 1936, and his version helped the \"Wabash\" legend spread around the world.\n\nGuy Clark — \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\"\n\nClark penned a beautiful tribute to his grandmother's boyfriend, Jack Prigg, \"an old school man of the world\" who would sing \"Red River Valley\" with the budding songwriter.\n\nBrooks & Dunn — \"Believe\"\n\nThe country duo won multiple awards for this soulful ballad of unwavering faith.\n\nThe Highwaymen — \"Highwayman\"\n\nOnly songwriting great Jimmy Webb could conjure up an epic theme worthy of country's greatest supergroup, composed of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.\n\nLarry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers — \"All the Gold in California\"\n\nIn soaring three-part harmony, the Gatlins issued a warning to all who head west with stars in their eyes: \"It don't matter at all where you've played before/\n\nCalifornia's a brand-new game.\"\n\nCharlie Daniels Band — \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\"\n\nIn 1979, Daniels found the perfect showcase for his fiery fiddle technique — a familiar tale about a boy named Johnny who makes a bet with the devil (and wins).\n\nJoe Diffie — “John Deere Green”\n\nAgainst all odds, tractors have nothing to do with Diffie's 1993 song. Instead, \"John Deere Green\" is the color used to paint \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" on the town's water tower.\n\nEarl Thomas Conley — \"Holding Her and Loving You\"\n\nIt doesn’t have a chorus, but “Holding Her and Loving You” has quite a hook. Conley counts down the hardest things he'll ever do, and the song's title tops the list.\n\nDixie Chicks — \"Wide Open Spaces\"\n\nWith the title track of their breakthrough album — about a young woman who's ready to spread her wings — the Dixie Chicks truly took flight.\n\nKacey Musgraves — \"Follow Your Arrow\"\n\nOn top of taking mainstream country into new territory with its \"Kiss lots of boys/ Or kiss lots of girls\" line, \"Follow Your Arrow\" was a powerful mission statement from Musgraves, as she's proven to have great artistic instincts.\n\nPatty Loveless — \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye\"\n\n\"Time will ease your pain,\" Loveless sang. That may be true, but this tearjerker about carrying on after a move, a divorce and the death of a parent still stings 25 years later.\n\nSugarland — “Stay”\n\nWhat if \"Jolene\" could have given her side of the story? On Sugarland's massive 2007 hit, Jennifer Nettles sings from the perspective of a mistress, who begs her lover to stay before deciding she's tired of waiting.\n\nMartina McBride — \"Independence Day\"\n\nIt's often falsely assumed to be a patriotic song, but McBride's triumphant anthem is actually about a woman breaking free of an abusive relationship.\n\nLee Ann Womack — \"I Hope You Dance\"\n\nWhether you're singing it to your kids, a loved one or yourself, Womack's plea to live life to the fullest and take chances truly resonates.\n\nK.T. Oslin — \"80's Ladies\"\n\nOslin rocketed through the decades on her 1987 hit, which fittingly sounds very much like a product of its time. \"Now we're 80's ladies/ There ain't been much these ladies ain't tried.\"\n\nJohn Anderson — \"Swingin’ \"\n\nSure, it's about swinging on the porch (is it really, though?), but few country hits have strutted the way Anderson's feisty, horn-spiked 1983 hit does.\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band — \"Fishin’ in the Dark\"\n\n\"You and me going fishing in the dark/ Lying on our backs and counting the stars.\" NGDB's classic is all about simple pleasures, and listening to it is one, too.\n\nKenny Chesney — “The Good Stuff”\n\nKenny's bartender teaches him a valuable lesson: \"The good stuff\" isn't booze; it's the memories you make with your loved ones.\n\nGeorge Jones and Tammy Wynette — \"Golden Ring\"\n\nGeorge and Tammy's greatest duet explains that \"only love\" can transform a \"cold metallic thing\" into something more.\n\nLuke Bryan — “Drink a Beer”\n\nBryan didn't write this song, but he made a powerful connection to it, relating it to the deaths of his brother and sister. He sings about learning of the death of a friend and going to the pier they would sit at to \"watch the sunset disappear and drink a beer.\"\n\nLefty Frizzell — \"If You’ve Got the Money, I’ve Got the Time\"\n\nSome things never change. In 1950, Frizzell kicked off his celebrated career with this No. 1 tune about painting the town red and going \"honky tonkin.'\"\n\nToby Keith — \"How Do You Like Me Now\"\n\nKeith was already an established star, but he didn't really crank up the attitude until this 1999 hit, in which he rubs his success in the face of an unrequited love.\n\nWaylon Jennings — \"Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line\"\n\n\"Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes/ And I'm getting pretty tired of it.\" The outlaw legend is barely holding it together on his seething 1968 hit.\n\nEmmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt — \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\"\n\nThe iconic trio finds exquisite harmony on a Rodney Crowell composition.\n\nHank Williams — “Your Cheatin’ Heart”\n\nSome consider this Williams entry, a can't-miss in country music history, to define the genre.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/entertainment/bob-saget-death-full-house/index.html", "title": "Bob Saget, comedian and 'Full House' star, dead at 65 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nBob Saget, the comedian and actor arguably known best by audiences as wholesome patriarch Danny Tanner on the sitcom “Full House,” has died, his family confirmed in a statement to CNN.\n\nHe was 65.\n\n“We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today,” the Saget family said in their statement. “He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter. Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world.”\n\nSaget was found dead in a hotel room on Sunday at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes, according to a statement from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n“The man was identified as Robert Saget & pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case,” the Sheriff’s statement read.\n\nThe cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner, the Sheriff’s office added.\n\nSaget was in Florida as part of his comedy tour.

Appreciative audience. Thanks again to @RealTimWilkins for opening. I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight. I’m happily addicted again to this s—t.”\n\nSaget, though known on the stage and among his friends for his raunchy humor, first became known to audiences on family-friendly programming. He starred as the widowed father of three girls on ABC’s “Full House” and then as host of the network’s “America’s Funniest Home Videos” clip show.\n\nAs Saget recalled to Jake Tapper in a July 2021 interview, the track of his career was unexpected.\n\n“‘Full House’ was an accident,” he said. “I got fired on CBS and was asked to be in ‘Full House.’”\n\nThe sitcom, which starred Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin and twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in one role, ran for eight seasons. It lived on in syndication with strong enough nostalgia surrounding it that Netflix picked up a spin-off in 2016, “Fuller House,” starring Bure but featuring frequent appearances from original stars, including Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos. It ran for five seasons, concluding in 2020.\n\nJodie Sweetin, Mary-Kate Olsen, Bob Saget, Candace Cameron Bure in 1993 in \"Full House.\" Bob D'Amico/ABC/Everett Collection\n\n“I’m close with all the kids. It doesn’t happen a lot in the world where you stay close with all the people,” Saget told Tapper. “We’re an unusual cast in that way that I have been able to remain close with everybody, because I don’t take eight years of my life lightly and then the other five or six years, six seasons.”\n\nHis “Full House” co-star Stamos expressed his grief over the loss of his friend and former colleague on Sunday.\n\n“I am broken. I am gutted,” Stamos wrote on Twitter. “I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.”\n\nI am broken. I am gutted. I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby. — John Stamos (@JohnStamos) January 10, 2022\n\nCoulier also marked his former co-star’s death on social media, posting a photo of the two holding hands and writing, “I’ll never let go, brother. Love you.”\n\nI’ll never let go, brother. Love you❤️ https://t.co/FYgrfqmdRq — Dave Coulier (@DaveCoulier) January 10, 2022\n\nFollowing his first round of sitcom fame, Saget worked steadily in film and television roles but became known to a new generation of sitcom fans on CBS’s “How I Met Your Mother,” acting as narrator and the voice of future Ted Mosby. That show ran until 2014.\n\nThroughout the years, Saget remained a fixture in stand-up comedy, releasing multiple specials over the years and taking his show on the road.\n\nSaget’s reputation for reveling in a much edgier brand of comedy could be seen in movies like “The Aristocrats” – exploring the competition among comics to tell the filthiest version of the same joke – and his guest stint on HBO’s “Entourage” as a version of himself.\n\nAsked by Esquire to define his humor in a 2013 interview, Saget explained, “I am basically just a nine-year-old boy that evolved.” Toward that end, Saget seemed to relish pushing back against his success in squeaky-clean shows, telling dirty jokes at ABC events to make the executives squirm.\n\nSaget was in the midst of a tour at the time of his death that was set to take him to locations in New York, Canada and several other locations in the coming months.\n\nAccording to his website, Saget often hosted comedy events to raise money for the Scleroderma Research Foundation, for which he served on the board of directors. He lost his sister to the chronic disease in 1994, his website said.\n\nIn 2020, he launched a podcast, titled “Bob Saget’s Here For You,” an interview show where he welcomed guests like Tiffany Haddish, Jason Sudeikis, Whoopi Goldberg and Norman Lear.\n\nLear was one of the many who paid tribute to Saget on Sunday.\n\n“Bob Saget was as lovely a human as he was funny,” Lear wrote on Twitter. “And to my mind, he was hilarious. We were close friends and I could not have loved him more.”\n\nFellow comedian and podcaster Marc Maron added: “Oh no. RIP Bob Saget. Truly one of the nicest guys and so funny. Very sad.”\n\nComedian Gilbert Gottfried described his “shock” over the news, writing on Twitter: “I just spoke with Bob a few days ago. We stayed on the phone as usual making each other laugh.

Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed that firefighters and paramedics responded to a call on the 2900 block of South Chesapeake Ave. at 4 p.m. local time for reports of a medical emergency. When they arrived, they found an unresponsive male and performed “resuscitation efforts for approximately 45 minutes.”\n\nThe patient “was determined dead just before 5:00 p.m.,” Scott said.\n\nAn autopsy performed on Coolio Thursday did not reveal the cause or manner of Coolio’s death and further investigation will be conducted, according to case information from the county coroner..\n\n“We are saddened by the loss of our dear friend and client,” a statement provided to CNN from Coolio’s talent manager Sheila Finegan said.\n\n“He touched the world with the gift of his talent and will be missed profoundly. Thank you to everyone worldwide who has listened to his music and to everyone who has been reaching out regarding his passing. Please have Coolio’s loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.”\n\nActor Lou Diamond Phillips also offered his condolences as he recounted some memories with the artist.\n\n“I am absolutely stunned. Coolio was a friend and one of the warmest, funniest people I’ve ever met. We spent an amazing time together making Red Water in Capetown and we loved going head to head in the kitchen. He was one of a kind. Epic,Legendary and I’ll miss him,” Phillips said in a tweet.\n\nFormer NBA player Matt Bonner also recalled time spent with Coolio, saying in a Twitter post the rapper was a “huge hoops fan… we hosted him at a game a few years back… biggest crowd of all-time at a Spurs Overtime concert.”\n\nCoolio grew up in Compton, California, according to a bio on his official website.\n\nSpeaking to the Los Angeles Times in 1994, he recalled falling into the drug scene but getting himself out by pursuing a career as a firefighter.\n\nCoolio, pictured on September 08, 2022. Randy Holmes/ABC/Getty Images\n\n“I wasn’t looking for a career, I was looking for a way to clean up – a way to escape the drug thing,” he told the publication. “It was going to kill me and I knew I had to stop. In firefighting training was discipline I needed. We ran every day. I wasn’t drinking or smoking or doing the stuff I usually did.”\n\nHis rap career began in the ’80s, and he gained fame in the underground scene.\n\n“Fantastic Voyage” was the first song that really put him on the map.\n\nArguably his biggest song, “Gangsta’s Paradise,” from the soundtrack to the film “Dangerous Minds,” grew his star power to gigantic proportions. He won a Grammy in 1996 for the song.\n\nIn the age of streaming, it has continued to live on. In July 2022, the song reached a milestone one billion views on YouTube.\n\n“It’s one of those kinds of songs that transcends generations,” he said in a recent interview. “I didn’t use any trendy words…I think it made it timeless.”\n\nOver his career, Coolio sold more than 17 million records, according to his website.\n\nCoolio also has a special place in the hearts of some Millennials for his work on the theme song for the popular Nickelodeon TV series “Kenan and Kel” and his contribution to the album “Dexter’s Laboratory: The Hip-Hop Experiment,” which featured songs by various hip-hop artists that were inspired by the Cartoon Network animated series.\n\nIn recent years, Coolio enjoyed the perks of being a nostalgic figure, making television appearances on shows like “Celebrity Cook Off” and “Celebrity Chopped.”\n\nHe also had a show on Oxygen, “Coolio’s Rules,” that aired 2008.", "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2012/12/28/music-deaths/1796889/", "title": "Passages in 2012: Notable deaths in music", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nRichard Adler, 90, composer and lyricist who won Tony Awards for co-writing songs for such hit Broadway musicals as The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees.

In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children. Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert’s honor,” his family wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nCNN has contacted Gottfried’s publicist for further comment.\n\nHe was known for his grating voice and blue comedy\n\nThough audiences know him by his grating tone, it wasn’t yet his signature when he debuted as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live” for one season from 1980 to 1981, one of a few seasons without Lorne Michaels at the helm. He mostly performed stand-up throughout the ’80s, regularly appearing on Howard Stern’s radio show.\n\nThough he had a few movie and TV credits in the ’80s, including the hit sequel “Beverly Hills Cop 2,” Gottfried’s celebrity didn’t rise until the 1990s. Throughout the decade, he employed his signature scream-speak in parts in animated films like “Aladdin,” as the mouthy macaw Iago, as well as live-action comedies like “Problem Child,” in which he played a scheming adoption agency employee.\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Gottfried appeared in voice roles on series like “Family Guy” and as a contestant or “talking head” on reality series, including “Celebrity Wife Swap.” (He swapped wives with the late Alan Thicke.)\n\nIn his stand-up comedy, though, Gottfried’s style was filthy and delivered at a high decibel (perhaps you’ve heard him tell the famously blue “Aristocrats” joke). He also broached extremely sensitive topics head on, recalling in a 2012 opinion piece for CNN about a 9/11 joke he made during a roast of Hugh Hefner in Manhattan just days after the attacks (his audience didn’t appreciate it).\n\nIn the same piece, he defended tweets he posted about the 2011 tsunami in Japan as “silly” and “dumb,” though those tweets later led Aflac, for whom he provided the voice of its mascot duck, to fire him.\n\n“I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates,” he wrote for CNN at the time.\n\nGottfried’s envelope-pushing, blue material was right at home during several Comedy Central roasts of celebrities such as former President Donald Trump in 2011.\n\nGilbert Gottfried performing in 2016.

For nearly a decade, he’d interviewed comedy and entertainment figures on his podcast, “Gilbert Gottfried’s Amazing Colossal Podcast.” A new episode was released earlier this month.\n\nNumerous fellow comedians and former co-stars of Gottfried paid tribute on social media.\n\n“Gilbert Gottfried was never not funny,” comedian Dane Cook wrote. “He was a lovely guy, always friendly & made many people happy.”\n\n“Gilbert Gottfried made me laugh at times when laughter did not come easily. What a gift,” actor Jason Alexander wrote in a tweet.\n\n“Nobody was funnier than @RealGilbert on a roll,” writer and director Judd Apatow shared. “He could put you into convulsive hysterics.

It'd be great to get it back,\" he said.\n\nJudge also praised the fan for making a “great catch” and said the man had every right to keep the prized souvenir.\n\nAnother fan was escorted away after leaping over the rail into a gap between the seats and the left-field wall. The crowd of 38,832 was Texas' third sellout of the season.\n\nAlmost as soon as Judge connected on a 1-1 slider from right-hander Jesús Tinoco, his Yankees teammates streamed out of the dugout to celebrate with him. But they stayed away from home plate — leaving him to step on it before sharing hugs and high-fives.\n\n“You never know how you’re going to react in the moment. And it was just so, so very cool,” manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nGerrit Cole, who set a Yankees single-season strikeout record in the same game, said he didn't know if Judge was pressing as of late, but chuckled when saying everybody else on the team was.\n\n“Just wanted it to happen so bad,\" Cole said. “So I don’t know if that’s pressing, or it’s just hoping hard. We were all just hoping really hard I think ... He’s not trying to get the record for himself. He’s trying to get the record for his teammates, and for the Yankee fans.”\n\nNew York wound up losing the second game after winning the opener 5-4. With one game left in the regular season, the split left the Yankees with a fitting 99-62 record — Judge's number and his home run total.\n\nJudge's mother and father were in the stands to see the 30-year-old outfielder end a five-game homerless streak, including the earlier game Tuesday when he was 1 for 5 with a single.\n\nThe Maris family wasn't in Texas after following Judge around for a while, but Roger Maris Jr. tweeted, “Congratulations to Aaron Judge and his family on Aaron’s historic home run number 62! It has definitely been a baseball season to remember. You are all class and someone who should be revered. For the MAJORITY of the fans, we can now celebrate a new CLEAN HOME RUN KING!!”\n\nWhen the top of the first ended, and Judge went to take his place in right field, he carried the glove and cap of first baseman DJ LeMahieu, who patted him on the back.\n\nThe fans in right field cheered Judge loudly while he warmed up by tossing a ball back and forth with center fielder Harrison Bader. Judge then provided another souvenir ball when he tossing the one he had warmed up with several rows deep.\n\nJudge, eligible to become a free agent after this season, struck out on a full-count pitch when batting again in the second.\n\nHe took his spot right field in the bottom of the inning before Boone pulled him from the game. Oswaldo Cabrera, who had been at second base, moved to right field and the slugger got another loud ovation as he jogged back to the Yankees dugout on the third base side.\n\nReaction quickly came from far beyond the ballpark.\n\n“History made, more history to make,” President Joe Biden posted on Twitter.\n\nTweeted former Yankees star Derek Jeter: “Congrats @TheJudge44 on 62! Postseason next!!!”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton also tweeted congratulations, as did former MLB players like Paul O'Neill, Dwight Gooden, Dave Winfield and Ryan Howard.\n\nMaris’ 61 for the Yankees had been exceeded six times previously, but all were tainted by the stench of steroids. Along with Bonds' record, Mark McGwire hit 70 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998 and 65 the following year. Sammy Sosa had 66, 65 and 63 for the Chicago Cubs during a four-season span starting in 1998.\n\nMcGwire admitted using banned steroids, while Bonds and Sosa denied knowingly using performing-enhancing drugs. Major League Baseball started testing with penalties for PEDs in 2004, and some fans — perhaps many — until now have considered Maris as holder of the legitimate record.\n\nA Ruthian figure with a smile as outsized as his body, the 6-foot-7 Judge has rocked the major leagues with a series of deep drives that hearken to the sepia tone movie reels of his legendary pinstriped predecessors.\n\nThe doubleheader nightcap in Texas was his 55th game in row Judge had played since Aug. 5.\n\nBoone initially said Judge earned himself a day off Wednesday, but then said he would speak with the slugger who had already said he hoped to play in the regular season finale, before the AL East champion Yankees have five days until the AL Division Series.\n\n“We’ll have a conversation and see what makes the most sense,” Boone said. “And I’ll try and lead him in a certain direction, maybe he’ll lead me back in the other direction.”\n\nJudge had gone 3 for 17 with five walks and a hit by pitch since moving past the 60 home runs Babe Ruth hit in 1927, which had stood as the major league record for 34 years. Maris hit his 61st off Boston’s Tracy Stallard at old Yankee Stadium on Oct. 1, 1961.\n\nJudge likely will come up short of becoming the first AL Triple Crown winner since Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera in 2012. He leads the AL with 131 RBIs and goes into the final day of the regular season trailing Minnesota’s Luis Arraez, who was hitting .315. Judge was at .311, right where he had started the day.\n\nJudge’s accomplishment will cause endless debate.\n\n“To me, the holder of the record for home runs in a season is Roger Maris,” author George Will said earlier this month. “There’s no hint of suspicion that we’re seeing better baseball than better chemistry in the case of Judge. He’s clean. He’s not doing something that forces other players to jeopardize their health.”\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/19/62-and-700-judge-pujols-closing-in-on-home-run-milestones/50752401/", "title": "62 and 700: Judge, Pujols closing in on home run milestones", "text": "AP\n\nAaron Judge and Albert Pujols could make this a milestone week for home runs.\n\nJudge hit two more Sunday, raising his season total to 59, two shy of Roger Maris' American League record. Now the slugger returns to Yankee Stadium, where New York will play its next six games. Pujols, meanwhile, is somewhat improbably closing in on the 700-homer mark after hitting 12 since the start of August.\n\nJudge's pursuit of Maris has stirred debate over how to put this AL record in context, should he break it. He's unlikely to threaten Barry Bonds' major league record of 73, but that mark, as well as the exploits of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa around the same time, have become complicated by performance-enhancing drug suspicions.\n\nThere's one way in which Judge will likely surpass both Bonds and Maris, no matter how many more homers he hits. Right now, he has an incredible 20-homer lead over Kyle Schwarber, who is second in the majors. Nobody has led baseball in homers by at least 20 since Babe Ruth finished with 54 in 1928 and nobody else had more than 31.\n\nMaris only led the majors by seven when he hit 61, and Bonds led by nine when he hit 73.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nJudge is also in the mix for the AL Triple Crown — he's leading big in homers and RBIs and just one point behind batting leader Luis Arraez — but that won't sort itself out until closer to the end of the season.\n\nThe 42-year-old Pujols, who is retiring at the end of the season, is trying to become the fourth major leaguer to reach 700 homers, following Bonds, Henry Aaron and Ruth. Unlike Judge, he won't be going for his milestone at home this week. St. Louis' next eight games are on the road against the Padres, Dodgers and Brewers.\n\nCUTTING IT CLOSE\n\nIs it possible the Padres won't even make the playoffs after pulling off the blockbuster trade for Juan Soto? San Diego holds the second wild card in the National League at the moment, but the Padres are only a half-game ahead of Philadelphia and 2 1/2 ahead of Milwaukee.\n\nSan Diego is 24-20 since the start of August for a .545 winning percentage — after going 57-46 (.553) prior to that. Soto has hit only .221 since joining the Padres.\n\nSan Diego did win the last three games of a series with Arizona, with Soto hitting his first homer this month Sunday.\n\nTRIVIA TIME\n\nWho is the most recent player to lead the majors in home runs by double digits?\n\nLINE OF THE WEEK\n\nWhile Schwarber is second in the majors in home runs with 39, Houston's Yordan Alvarez is second to Judge in the AL with 37. He homered in his first three at-bats Friday night in the Astros' 5-0 victory over Oakland.\n\nHonorable mention: In that same game, Justin Verlander came back from the injured list for Houston and threw five no-hit innings before being removed.\n\nCOMEBACK OF THE WEEK\n\nIt's actually a double dose this week.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Texas trailed Oakland 7-2 in the fifth inning before rallying for an 8-7 victory. Mark Mathias homered twice, including a solo shot in the ninth to win it. The Athletics had a 94.8% chance to win in the fifth inning, according to Baseball Savant.\n\nThe next night, the script was flipped. Oakland beat Texas 8-7 after the Rangers were up 5-1 after four. The win probability for Texas peaked at 93.2%. The Athletics completed their comeback with two runs in the top of the ninth, with the go-ahead run coming in on an error by shortstop Corey Seager.\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER\n\nJose Bautista hit 54 home runs in 2010, finishing 12 ahead of Pujols.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2017/09/25/aaron-judge-50-home-runs-rookie/701759001/", "title": "Aaron Judge at 50: A worthy king of rookie home runs", "text": "Corrections/clarifications: A previous version of this story included an incorrect number of home runs Roger Maris hit in 1961.\n\nFinally, for the first time in more than a half-century, we have a home run record we can truly celebrate.\n\nAaron Judge, one of the most likable, genuine, young athletes in sports, set a major league record Monday afternoon by becoming the first rookie in history to hit 50 home runs in a season.\n\nThe record no longer belongs to Mark McGwire, who hit 49 home runs for the Oakland Athletics in 1987, then decades later saw his steroid use come to light.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores\n\nIt belongs to Judge, and for that, we can celebrate for the first time since Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961, breaking Babe Ruth’s record.\n\nMORE ON JUDGE:\n\nNo. 50:Judge breaks McGwire's rookie home run record\n\nBronx Bomber:Judge makes Yankee history\n\nKlapisch:Aaron Judge for MVP? Better believe it\n\nSure, to be honest, Major League Baseball widely celebrated the night of Sept. 8, 1998, when McGwire hit his 62nd home run of the year, eclipsing Maris, at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. He crossed home plate, lifted his son Matthew high in the air, walked over to the stands, hugged the Maris family, and America ate it up.\n\nThere were suspicions the record was tainted, with he and Sammy Sosa waging a dynamic home-run race, but there were only whispers. No one wanted to believe McGwire was in the heart of the steroid era until he confessed himself on national TV, years after he was undressed by a congressional committee.\n\nThis rookie home run record isn’t nearly as famous. It wasn’t as if 49 was a household number, even if McGwire famously skipped a chance to hit 50 to witness Matthew's birth.\n\nIf Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton, with 57 homers, reaches 62 homers by the end of the year, his feat will be much more renowned. It will be the most by any hitter not linked to performance-enhancing drugs since Maris.\n\nYet, no matter how you want to slice it, and no matter how much anyone will want to argue, it still won’t be a record.\n\nThe single-season home run record is 73 set by Barry Bonds in 2001. McGwire has the second-most with 70. Sosa is third with 66.\n\nIf Stanton hits 62 home runs, he’ll have the seventh-most homers in a single-season.\n\nA tremendous accomplishment. A fabulous season. But no record.\n\nBonds’ record will stand until someone hits 74 homers one day, perhaps lasting even longer than Maris’ mark that stood for 37 hears, or Ruth’s that lasted 34 years.\n\nThis isn’t the Olympics. No one can ever strip away Bonds' record. There are no NCAA officials to vacate home-run totals. Bonds may have been juiced, but so was nearly half of the game. He was hitting homers off dozens of pitchers using performance-enhancing drugs, too.\n\nBut this one by Judge, in this era of rigorous if not bulletproof drug testing, now this is a record.\n\nSomeone will beat it one day, maybe soon considering this day and age of juiced balls, information-hungry hitters and smaller ballparks, but no one can ever diminish it.\n\nHe joins Ruth, Maris, Mickey Mantle and Alex Rodriguez as the only players in Yankee history to hit 50 homers in a season; it's the second-highest homer total by a right-handed hitter in franchise history.\n\nThe Yankees, who clinched a playoff berth over the weekend, spent the postgame lauding Judge’s accomplishments, even campaigning for him to win the American League MVP award over Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros.\n\nThe only one who refused to pay attention was the guy who was embarrassed to even take a curtain call, the first of his career.\n\n“I don’t know, I really haven’t thought about that,’’ Judge said of his MVP chances. “I don’t try to think about that, especially with what this team has got going on with this playoff push.\n\n“I’d rather be in a good position in the playoffs and holding up a World Series trophy than holding up an MVP trophy.’’\n\nAnd to anyone who has ever met Judge, the gentle giant at 6-foot-7, 285 pounds, they know he’s sincere about every word that comes out of his mouth.\n\nYou want to know where those record home-run record balls, No. 49 and No. 50, are headed now that the Yankees retrieved them for Judge?\n\n“I’ll give them to my parents,’’ said Judge, who grew up in tiny Linden, Calif., “especially with all of the sacrifices they made for me over the last 25 years.’’\n\nMORE\n\nThe ball:Fans gives record HR ball to Judge\n\nYou want to know what he actually thought when he hit No. 50, setting the record at Yankee Stadium?\n\n“I can’t thank my teammates enough,’’ he said, “and this organization for putting me in this position. It’s an incredible feeling.’’\n\nYou want to know what he was thinking just before he crossed home plate, pointing towards the sky?\n\n“The Lord,’’ Judge says. “He put me in this position. He blessed me with so many opportunities in my life. Just a quick moment to thank him.’’\n\nThis is Judge, beloved as any young star in New York since the days of Derek Jeter.\n\nHe treated everyone the exact same as when he showed up to spring training as a long-shot to make the team, to commanding the game's attention with his monstrous first half, to winning the All-Star Home Run Derby, to his ugly struggles in August, to hitting 13 home runs alone in September.\n\n“To put on the pinstripes,’’ Judge says, “it’s extraordinary. Just being able to play one game with the Yankees is quite an honor.’’\n\nThe real honor is that we now have a home run hero again, breaking a record that we can all celebrate, wishing one day that he spends a magical season without ever going into a home-run funk.\n\nThe year he hits 74 home runs.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook\n\nGallery: All-Rise: Aaron Judge hits the Bronx", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/01/mlb-september-questions-mets-braves-aaron-judge/7957162001/", "title": "MLB in September: Biggest questions entering baseball's stretch run", "text": "A typical Major League Baseball regular season, at one point in the game’s history, ended before the calendar flipped to October.\n\nWhile that is no longer true, September remains a make-or-break month – for teams fighting for postseason positioning, a player looking to turn around a lost campaign, a call-up looking to make a first impression or (and this may be specific to 2022) a future Hall of Famer chasing a legendary milestone.\n\nFollow every game: Live MLB Scores", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

The initial coalition of countries announced their commitment ahead of the One Planet summit in 2021.\n\nIn recent years, Australia’s wildlife has suffered due to natural disasters, land clearing, feral predators and the effects of the climate crisis, including the “Black Summer” fires that tore across southern states in 2019-20, killing or displacing nearly 3 billion animals, according to estimates from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n\nThe fires contributed to the bleak outlook for Australian biodiversity detailed in the State of the Environment 2021 report. Belatedly released this July, the report found that Australia had lost more mammal species than any other continent and “continues to have one of the highest rates of species decline among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.”\n\nThe previous Coalition government had opted not to release the report ahead of the federal election in May, with some speculating that its contents were so alarming that the government worried it could cost them votes. They lost the election anyway, which saw a higher number of environmental advocates win seats across the country.\n\nAnimals on Kangaroo Island in South Australia suffered during the 2019-20 bushfires. Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s in the plan\n\nThe new plan identifies 20 places and 110 species that will become the focus of conservation efforts.\n\nThe government says the priority species were selected based on several factors, including their uniqueness and risk of extinction, while the priority places represent a “broad range of Australian landscapes and ecosystems.” The areas include the forests of Far North Queensland, Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.\n\n“By focusing in on these species and these places, we have the biggest chance of success,” Plibersek said.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund Australia’s Chief Conservation Officer, Rachel Lowry, applauded the government’s commitment to Australia’s threatened species but said the plan should go further.\n\nAustralia listed the gang-gang cockatoo as an endangered species in March, 2022. Paulo Lagos/Adobe Stock\n\n“Australia has more than 1,900 listed threatened species. This plan picks 110 winners. It’s unclear how it will help our other ‘non priority’ threatened species such as our endangered greater glider for example,” Lowry said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation’s nature program manager, Basha Stasak, said “stopping the destruction of wildlife habitat is the key” to achieving the government’s goal of no new extinctions.\n\nStasak added that the government’s plan is “ambitious but essential if future generations of Australians are to see animals like koalas, mountain pygmy possums, greater gliders and gang-gang cockatoos,” all of which are listed as endangered or vulnerable species.\n\nThe plan also includes continued emphasis on “actions that can most benefit threatened species,” such as minimizing the impact of threats like feral cats and foxes, getting the community involved in and leading recovery efforts, and helping priority species adapt to climate change so they ultimately become more resilient.\n\nFeral predators introduced by settlers during colonization have multiplied and played an outsized role in Australia’s environmental degradation.\n\nA recent study published in the journal Diversity and Distributions estimated that foxes and cats kill almost 700 million reptiles, 510 million birds and 1.4 billion mammals every year in Australia.", "authors": ["Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/14/climate-change-study-plant-animal-extinction/4760646002/", "title": "One-third of all plant and animal species could be extinct in 50 years ...", "text": "The hottest daily highs in summer are the key variable that explains whether a population will go extinct.\n\nMost species won't be able to \"escape\" to a cooler climate in order to avoid extinction.\n\nMany species were able to tolerate some increases in maximum temperatures, but only up to a point.\n\nOne-third of all animal and plant species on the planet could face extinction by 2070 due to climate change, a new study warns.\n\nResearchers studied recent extinctions from climate change to estimate how many species would be lost over the next 50 years.\n\nSpecifically, scientists from the University of Arizona studied data from 538 species at 581 sites around the world and focused on plant and animal species that were surveyed at the same sites over time, at least 10 years apart.\n\n\"By analyzing the change in 19 climatic variables at each site, we could determine which variables drive local extinctions and how much change a population can tolerate without going extinct,\" said Cristian Román-Palacios, of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, in a statement.\n\n\"We also estimated how quickly populations can move to try and escape rising temperatures.\n\n\"When we put all of these pieces of information together for each species, we can come up with detailed estimates of global extinction rates for hundreds of plant and animal species.\"\n\nGlobally, up to 1 million species are at risk of extinction because of human activities, according to a United Nations report released in May. Many experts say a “mass extinction event” – only the sixth in the past half-billion years – is already underway.\n\nClimate change:Bumblebees are disappearing at rates 'consistent with mass extinction'\n\nThis study found that maximum annual temperatures – the highest daily highs in summer – are the key variable that best explains whether a species will go extinct.\n\nPrevious studies have focused on migration to cooler habitats as a way for species to \"escape\" from warming climates. However, this study found that most species won't be able to do this quickly enough to avoid extinction, based on their past rates of movement.\n\nInstead, researchers found that many species were able to tolerate some increases in maximum temperatures, but only up to a point.\n\nThey found that about 50% of the species had local extinctions if maximum temperatures increased by more than 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit, and up to 95% if temperatures increased by more than 5.2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nProjections of species loss depend on how much climate will warm in the future.\n\n\"If we stick to the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, we may lose fewer than 2 out of every 10 plant and animal species on Earth by 2070,\" said study co-author John J. Wiens of the University of Arizona.\n\n\"But if humans cause larger temperature increases, we could lose more than a third or even half of all animal and plant species, based on our results.\"\n\nThe study was published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n'Crowded out of existence':Up to 1M species at risk of extinction because of human activities, report says\n\nGlobal warming:Iceberg twice the size of Washington, D.C., breaks off Pine Island glacier in Antarctica", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-infrastructure-bill-film-museum-la-5-things-podcast/5931559001/", "title": "Congress poised to avoid government shutdown, 23 species ...", "text": "Taylor Wilson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOn today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Lawmakers are confident they will vote to extend funding today and therefore avoid a partial government shutdown.

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning, I'm Taylor Wilson. And this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 30th of September, 2021. Today Congress has hours to avoid a government shutdown. Plus nearly two dozen new species have been declared extinct and more.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHere are some of the top headlines.\n\nEcuador has declared a prison emergency after a gang-related riot in Guayaquil killed at least 116 people and injured another 80, the worst prison bloodbath ever in the country. Authorities say at least five of the dead were found to be beheaded. Suicide among US troops rose 15% in 2020 from the year before. In a report last year on suicide, the Pentagon said that suicide rates for active duty troops are comparable with the average US adult population, but said trends are not going in the right direction. And foreign fans will not be allowed to attend this winter's Olympics in Beijing. That's part of the International Olympic Committee's COVID-19 protocols announced this week. There will also be lengthy quarantines for unvaccinated athletes.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCongress still has not scheduled votes to extend funding today and avoid a government shutdown. But leading lawmakers say they will likely take action before tonight's midnight deadline. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said yesterday that the Senate will work quickly to pass a funding bill to allow the government to operate through December 3rd. He said that will give lawmakers time to approve routine spending measures like funding federal agencies and programs they administer for the fiscal year beginning tomorrow.\n\nChuck Schumer:\n\nTo prevent a government shutdown, Senate Democrats will be introducing a continuing resolution that keeps the government open until early December, while also providing long sought emergency funding to help Americans still reeling from natural disasters from this summer, as well as funding to help resettle Afghan refugees. We can improve this measure quickly and send it to the House so it can reach the president's desk before funding expires midnight tomorrow. With so many critical issues to address, the last thing the American people need right now is a government shutdown. This proposal will prevent one from happening and I want to thank my colleagues who are working quickly to prepare this legislation.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSenator John Thune, the Senate's second highest ranking Republican said he also expects a vote today to avoid a shutdown, but that some lawmakers still want amendments or to add funding for things like Israel's defense. If the Senate moves the funding bill forward, the House is expected to approve it as would President Joe Biden. But if Congress does not avoid a shutdown, hundreds of thousands of non-essential federal employees could be furloughed without pay beginning tomorrow.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCapitol Hill is also working on a pair of infrastructure bills, one of them a $1.2 trillion infrastructure investment and jobs act could be voted on today. It would direct $550 billion in new spending over five years to modernize roads, bridges and transit systems. It would also expand high-speed internet systems and the country's network of electric vehicle charging stations. The bill already passed the Senate last month after months of negotiations. And Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants a vote today, even as some further left members of the chamber have threatened to vote against the legislation because they want it only to pass along with a broader $3.5 trillion bill. But moderate Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said they won't vote for such a steep price tag.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat legislation involves parts of so-called human infrastructure like universal preschool and community college, along with expansions to Medicare to cover vision, hearing, and dental. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden continues to work to urge lawmakers on passing both pieces of legislation.\n\nJen Psaki:\n\nI say that we've had about 260, probably more like 300 now engagements with a range of members and their offices over the course of just September, including a range of progressive members and their offices. I think it's pretty clear we're in the middle of a negotiation and that everybody's going to have to give a little.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor the latest from Capitol Hill, stay with our live Congress updates page on usatoday.com.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThree Congress women will testify today about their experiences with abortion. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform will look at the current state of abortion rights around the country in the wake of a new Texas law that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, only about two weeks after many even know they're pregnant. Testifying are Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Cori Bush, and Pramila Jayapal. Bush wrote on Twitter yesterday ahead of the hearing, quote, \"Tomorrow I will share a story that I've never fully told publicly before. I am testifying at the Oversight Committee hearing on abortion care and I will share that when I was 17, I was raped, became pregnant and got an abortion. And I am not ashamed.\" All three women shared intimate accounts on MSNBC last night. Lee said she traveled to a back alley clinic in Mexico to get an abortion. And Jayapal said postpartum depression after a previous pregnancy influenced her decision to get an abortion. She said she contemplated suicide at one point and was not ready to go through that again.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe world continues to go through its sixth mass extinction event in history. The latest victims, 23 species that the US government declared extinct yesterday. One of the most noteworthy is the ivory-billed woodpecker. The bird made unconfirmed appearances in recent decades across the American south and there's still some debate about it still existing in Cuba. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says it's exhausted efforts to find them. Other animals on the list include other birds and a variety of muscle species. Factors behind the specific disappearances vary. They include too much development, water pollution, logging, invasive species, habitat destruction due to climate change and more. But the common link: humans were the ultimate cause. Around the world, more than 900 species have now been documented as extinct, though the actual number is likely much higher because many are never formally identified. Scientists say animals and plants are now disappearing at 1000 times the historical rate. Jack Dumbacher, Curator of Ornithology, the study of birds at the California Academy of Sciences says that declaring animals extinct can help shore up resources to protect species that still have a chance at recovery.\n\nJack Dumbacher:\n\nThere's so many species that are in dire shape today, I think sometimes it becomes important to refocus our attention on the ones that we can save and the ones that need our attention right now. I think it's a sad thing. It's a difficult thing. There will be some losses, but at the same time, I think it is important to reevaluate from time to time where we are because these species haven't been seen in a very long time despite a lot of effort to find them. I think it's probably time to declare them extinct and hopefully learn the lessons that we need to learn and move on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSpecies that are currently maybe only a generation away from extinction include the Javan rhino with fewer than 70 left, the Hainan gibbon, a type of ape with fewer than 30 left. And the vaquita, a species of porpoise with possibly only nine remaining.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWell, there's finally a film museum in Los Angeles. Today the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures opens in LA, ending the often delayed journey to build one there. The museum was an original goal for the 94-year-old Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group that presents the Oscars. And most recent plans were announced back in 2012 before another pandemic related stop last year. Movie star Tom Hanks rang in the building's opening.\n\nTom Hanks:\n\nDo we need a movie museum? Yeah, because we need to celebrate everything that this town has brought to the world and everything art form has brought to the world in order to bring people together. Movies continue to be the magical art that speaks to everybody everywhere.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe museum features all kinds of props, including Bruce, the 25-foot long shark from the movie Jaws and a section highlighting original costumes. It also looks at Hollywood's often discriminatory history against people of color and celebrates diverse often overlooked filmmakers.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

The big cats were released into India’s Kuno National Park in the state of Madya Pradesh.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – who was celebrating his 72nd birthday – was there to welcome the cheetahs to their new home. “A long wait is over,” Modi wrote on Twitter alongside pictures of the cats in their new environment.\n\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952 and are the only large carnivore in the country to have suffered that fate.\n\nToday, the spotted felines are found in southern and eastern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, and Tanzania, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\n\nBut the endangered cats used to have a much larger range. Historically, cheetahs roamed throughout the Middle East and central India as well as most of sub-Saharan Africa. Habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans have greatly reduced their populations.\n\nThere are now less than 7,000 cheetahs left in the wild, says the WWF. In Iran, there are just 12 adult cheetahs in the wild.\n\nVets draw blood from a cheetah to be transported to India at Erindi, Namibia, August 4, 2022. Courtesy of Cheetah Conservation Fund/Reuters\n\nThe release of the eight animals is part of a larger plan to reintroduce the cats to their former range. In January, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change announced in a news release that the government planned to release 50 cheetahs into Indian national parks over the next five years.\n\nThe group that arrived in Kuno consists of three male and five female adult cheetahs from Namibia, according to a news release from the CCF. Each cheetah was vaccinated, fitted with a satellite collar and kept in isolation at the fund’s location in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, according to the release.\n\nThe animals chosen for the 11-hour trek were selected “based on an assessment of health, wild disposition, hunting skills, and ability to contribute genetics that will result in a strong founder population,” says the organization.\n\nIt took a multi-step journey to get the cats from Namibia, on Africa’s southwestern coast, to central India. On Friday, the cheetahs traveled from the CCF’s center to the Hosea Kutako International Airport in Windhoek, Namibia. Then, they took a private jet to Jaipur, India. Finally, on Saturday the cats were taken to Kuno National Park and released into their new home.\n\nTwo cheetahs are seen inside a quarantine section before being relocated to India. Denis Farrell/AP\n\n“As a conservationist, I am thrilled, and as CCF’s leader, I am exceptionally proud of the work of our CCF reintroduction team,” Laurie Marker, the founder and executive director of the CCF, said in the release. “Without research and dedication to cheetah conservation, this project could not take place.”\n\nJhala Yadvendradev, dean of the Wildlife Institute of India and principal scientist for India’s Project Cheetah, said that the project will benefit India’s ecoystems at large – not just cheetahs.\n\n“Bringing back a top predator restores historic evolutionary balance, resulting in cascading effects, leading to better management and restoration of wildlife habitat, for the benefit of all species, and will uplift the livelihoods of poor forest dwelling communities,” Yadvendradev said in the release.\n\nA cheetah runs inside a quarantine section before being relocated to India. Denis Farrell/AP\n\nA previous attempt to bring African cheetahs to Kuno National Park in 2012 was halted by India’s Supreme Court, which suggested that introducing a non-native species was problematic and warned the there might not be enough prey in the park to keep them fed.\n\nSP Yadav, Director General of Project Cheetah, said India has worked to prepare the park over several years, through anti-poaching measures and boosting the amount of prey.\n\nHowever, Faiyaz Khudsar, a conservation biologist who worked at the Kuno National Park for around eight years, is concerned the cheetahs may still not have enough to eat.\n\n“If naturally you build up the population of the prey base and then you bring in a new species or predator, it’s sustainable. (But if you bring in a) prey base from somewhere else … I don’t know which direction it will go after six months or a year,” Khudsar told CNN.\n\nA cheetah lies inside a transport cage at the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, on Sept. 16, 2022. Dirk Heinrich/AP\n\nKhudsar also said the cheetahs would have competition from aggressive other predators like leopards.\n\nBut Adrien Tordiff, associate professor at the University of Pretoria, who has been involved with Project Cheetah since 2020, said the cheetahs from South Africa had been selected with the National Park’s other creatures in mind.\n\n“Because they’re going into areas where there’s quite a high leopard density, we wanted animals that are really quite wild and very used to being with other large carnivores, lions, leopards and so on. So they’re not naïve of those carnivores, and they can avoid them, they can defend themselves against them, they’re really aware of what they are and the risks that they pose to them,” Tordiff told CNN.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change believes that bringing cheetahs back to India “will likely result in better conservation of open forest, grassland, and scrub ecosystems for which they will serve as a flagship species.”\n\nThe Indian government believes the factors that led to the cheetah’s extinction within the country – primarily hunting and habitat loss – have “abated.”\n\nUnder the British Raj, forests were cleared to develop settlements and set up plantations, resulting in the loss of habitat for big cats, such as the cheetah. Considered less dangerous than tigers and relatively easy to tame, cheetahs were also frequently used by Indian nobility for sport-hunting.\n\nAccording to Jhala, the last cheetahs were shot in 1947, shortly before they were officially declared extinct.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile Tara Subramaniam", "Zoe Sottile", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2022/09/27/arizona-tribe-helps-bring-apache-trout-back-near-extinction/8076056001/", "title": "How an Arizona tribe and wildlife biologists rescued the Apache ...", "text": "WHITERIVER — High in the White Mountains, Renaldo Dazen pulls his yellow Ram pickup truck, affectionally named “Bumblebee,” through the ponderosa pine-lined roads that follow the natural curves of the White River.\n\nDazen, a councilman for District 2 of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, was born and raised here. He points out rock cliffs in the shape of a woman, the high school he attended, the hospital where his daughters were born, and he has a story for just about every dirt road and swimming hole on the reservation.\n\nThe White Mountain Apache reservation stretches across about 1.24 million acres in eastern Arizona, rising at its highest point to 11,000 feet above sea level. It is the only place in the world where the state fish of Arizona lives in its natural habitat .\n\nThe Apache trout is deeply woven into the fabric of this part of the state and locals speak of the fish as if it is a legend. The barista at a coffee shop in nearby Pinetop banters with a regular about catching and cooking trout (her favorite way is smoking it) as he was heading out for a trip. The coffee-drinking angler across the counter admits he has never caught an Apache trout.\n\nAnd that’s not surprising. The Apache Trout has been a threatened species for nearly as long as it has been properly recognized. Formerly known as ‘yellowbellies” (because of their distinct golden belly) the Apache Trout got its new name in 1972. A year later it was among one of the first species to be recognized as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, a measure the U.S Supreme Court at the time called, “the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species enacted by any nation.”\n\nOne year after that, the fish was downlisted to threatened to allow for recreational fishing, with restrictions.\n\nNow, almost 50 years later, the days of the Apache trout as a ghost story for locals may be nearing an end as its population numbers continue to recover.\n\nIn August, U.S Fish and Wildlife Service announced the completion of a five-year status review, which recommends delisting the species from the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Service will next publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to delist the Apache trout, with a 60-day public comment period seeking input from government agencies, the scientific community or any other parties concerning the proposed delisting.\n\nHow stocking killed the Apache Trout\n\nIn the late 1800’s the Apache trout could be found in 680 miles of streams in the White Mountains. Recent counts estimate they currently occupy 30 percent of those original 680 miles.\n\nThe Apache trout faced a series of hurdles that led to a decline in its numbers. Overfishing, crossbreeding with non-native trout, habitat loss caused by wildfires, human destruction of riparian vegetation, livestock overgrazing, and water diversion and channelization of streams all contributed to the losses.\n\nIn the early 20th century fishermen and locals noticed a decline in their main food source in the spring and summer months, mostly attributed to overfishing and the effects from cattle grazing.\n\n“As settlement came up there into the White Mountains, there were a couple of things that contributed to the demise of the of the fish,” says Alan Davis, chair of the Arizona Council of Trout Unlimited. “Overfishing was one of them, but that was just one part of it.”\n\nThat’s when state and federal agencies first stepped in. Their plan to slow the shrinking numbers of Apache trout was simple: introduce new species of trout into the streams of the White Mountains to replenish the declining food sources for the growing number of settlers.\n\nBrook and brown trout were introduced first. But once these non-native fish entered the water, they began feeding on the younger native fish who had lived there all along.\n\nRainbow and cutthroat were later added to the streams. Those fish began to cross-breed with the Apache Trout, slicing through purebred populations. It would be the main driver in what led to the major decline in numbers of the fish.\n\nAware of these threats, in 1955 the White Mountain Apache Tribe took the first steps to conserve the species by closing fishing on tribal lands where pure trout population remained. In essence, the tribe declared the fish endangered 18 years before the Endangered Species Act was enacted.\n\nAfter the ESA, aggressive action was taken to grow and protect Apache trout populations. USFWS joined forces with the White Mountain Apache Tribe Game and Fish, as well as the U.S. Forest Service and Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nZachary Jackson is the project coordinator for the USFWS Arizona Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office in Whiteriver. He says the collaboration between agencies has allowed for increased and shared funding.\n\nOnce the tribe’s game and fish department closed Apache trout habitat to fishing where pure populations remained, the state wildlife agency stepped in and implemented various fishing restrictions, including bag limits on all species of trout.\n\nWatershed management plans were developed, and conservation efforts shifted toward segregating non-native trout and Apache trout.\n\nThe effort to restore the population included a halt to stocking of non-native species in and near Apache trout habitats, construction of barriers to keep non-native trout out, and removal of those that were already there.\n\nEndangered species:Wildlife managers say fish are recovering but may always need human help\n\nAnd how stocking helped save the Apache trout\n\nThe Beatles heartfelt “Let it Be” plays over the radio as Bumblebee — with Dazen — travels downhill and into Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery near the appropriately named Trout Creek on the northern edge of the reservation.\n\nWilliams Creek is one of two fish hatcheries operated by USFWS on the reservation. The other is Alchesay National Fish Hatchery, named after the former White Mountain Apache Chief William Alchesay.\n\nThese fish hatcheries are responsible for spawning and stocking trout in local waterways. Apache Trout are spawned and hatched in Williams Creek.\n\nUSFWS uses a method of electrofishing, which shocks fish without killing them, to collect milt (reproductive fluid for fish) for hatching at the facility.\n\nBradley Clarkson is an Apache trout biologist at Williams Creek. “We get in the water and check to see if they have milt,” he says. “If they do, we preserve it and send it out to Atlanta, Georgia, where they have the facility that stores the milt.”\n\nWhen April hits and spawning season begins the milt is shipped back here to begin the fertilization process.\n\nOver two million eggs are stored inside the hatchery building annually. After hatching, the fish are kept in tanks inside until they reach 2-3 inches (about the size of a fingertip). The fish are then moved to outdoor “raceways.”\n\nRaceways are artificial channels where thousands of fish will live before they are released into the wild once they reach about nine inches long.\n\n“Some are 12-14 (inches) because we have to keep brood stock for two years,” Clarkson says of the larger fish on the property. “So, we keep those around a little bit longer.”\n\nEach year the state receives 210,000 eggs from here to stock waterways on state lands. The tribe gets roughly 350,000 eggs for its land.\n\nClarkson has worked at the facility for 27 years and says the work done has been fundamental in restoring Apache trout populations to healthier levels.\n\nRecovering species:Grand Canyon's humpback chub downlisted from endangered to threatened\n\nDisease and climate change threaten conservation\n\nDespite the success of management efforts, not all fish that come through the hatcheries can be released into the wild.\n\nIn 2018, in a massive blow to recovery efforts, federal hatcheries tested positive for a bacterial kidney infection, a disease so difficult to manage that all the fish that tested positive had to be killed.\n\nTest are conducted by the hatcheries as well as at the state level.\n\nWilliams Creek collects variant samples from every female that is spawned at the facility and sends the samples to Southwestern Native Aquatic Resources Recovery Center in New Mexico to test for disease.\n\nClarkson says they are a disease-free hatchery.\n\nBut this past year the state rejected 20,000 fish that it believes were carrying disease that came from Williams Creek.\n\nClimate change is also intensifying the complexity of management and conservation efforts post-delisting.\n\n“It’s been difficult lately because weather changes,” admits the veteran biologist. “We don’t have enough water.”\n\nOn average, 1,500 gallons of water per minute are meant to move through the raceways at Williams Creek to maintain healthy water quality standards. On Sept. 15, 2022, that number was 1,270 gallons per minute. While this number sits below the average, both Dazen and Clarkson say that it is usually even lower, but an active monsoon season has helped.\n\n“It’s been going down the last few years,” Clarkson looks over a covered raceway housing Apache trout and shakes his head. “The drought.”\n\nThe ongoing drought has dried out forests across the state and increased the chance for wildfires. These fires can undo years of progress and wipe out entire populations of fish.\n\nIn 2011, the Wallow Fire swallowed more than half a million acres of forest in the White Mountains.\n\nIt caused significant damage to the Fish Creek watershed, an area that, before the fire, had an adult population of over 1,000 trout, which is significant for a creek of its size. And a monsoon storm following the fire completely wiped out the creek.\n\nApache trout are a cold water trout and thrive in waters with temperatures in the upper 40-degree range. That’s why the White Mountains are a perfect home for them. Deep cool pools and ample cover from ponderosa pine trees serve as protection for the fish and are vital for their health and reproduction.\n\nWildfires cause sediment runoff that can not only sicken fish, but also cause pools to fill in, pushing fish closer to the surface where water is warmer. This also contributes to a loss of riparian habitat, leading to a poor rate of regeneration of instream cover.\n\nPine trees and vegetation killed by wildfire will also reduce the amount of shade rivers and streams receive.\n\nLess tree cover results in more direct sunlight, warming streams. If the water reaches a median temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit, the Apache trout can experience reduced growth and their chance for survival drops significantly.\n\nAfter the Wallow Fire, experts believed the best way to reach long term recovery goals was to focus on larger streams. Larger populations and larger streams are more resilient to long term droughts and fires.\n\nApache trout:Recovery begins at a Payson fish hatchery where a threatened species could thrive\n\nFlowing forward, still plans to monitor\n\nIf delisted, Apache Trout will be monitored according to a post-delisting monitoring plan.\n\nHowever, the Apache trout cooperative management plan (signed by all parties involved in conservation in December 2021) also includes commitments to monitor and manage Apache trout populations in perpetuity.\n\nA main goal of the Apache recovery plan is to reach 30 genetically pure populations of Apache trout.\n\nToday, 26 pure populations of Apache trout are currently protected by natural or artificial barriers developed through conservation efforts. Of those, 18 are free of non-native trout.\n\nMore than $2 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s National Fish Passage Program, will go toward removing certain barriers that are no longer needed thanks to successful non-native trout removal.\n\nUSFWS believes the fish are on the path to a brighter and more sustainable future and if delisted it would be thanks to more than half a century worth of collaborative work from fish experts, tribal leaders and volunteers with a passion for conservation.\n\nDazen calls the land and the wildlife who roam here “a gift.” The Apache trout is one of those gifts, swimming upstream here at their healthiest levels since before conservation efforts began.\n\nThere is a saying that the past is present on the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and today this iconic fish with a prominent past is a testament to that.\n\nJake Frederico covers environment issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

Shortly after that, he became one of the 4.5 million Americans living under community supervision. And more than 10 years later, Mill was still on probation.\n\nIn the time since his initial arrest and sentence, while under onerous and unreasonable supervision, Mill has built a successful music career and become a pillar of his community. His probation was supposed to function as an alternative to incarceration. It didn’t work out that way.\n\nProbation made jail time more likely\n\nSince his original jail term ended, Mill has been incarcerated for 10 more months and on house arrest for 90 days.Traveling without permission (he was performing in a concert), being involved in an altercation at an airport or even popping a wheelie on a motorbike have all worked to trigger the criminal justice system like some hunter’s trap, yanking Mill back into the courtroom and, at times, behind bars.\n\nEven something as innocuous as visiting his son could trigger repercussions if he didn’t get approval from the court. His son lives in New Jersey, and crossing state lines (in other words, driving across the bridge from Philadelphia to New Jersey for 15 minutes) could violate his probation. We call these “technical violations” of probation. They’re not new crimes. They’re just violations of a rule. But in Pennsylvania, as is true of many states, the consequence can be the same — prison.\n\nThe circumstances around Mill’s seemingly endless legal ordeal may feel like a worst case scenario. After all, how often do Americans actually face incarceration over technical violations — over breaking the administrative rules of their probation?\n\nThe answer is a strikingly high number of times.\n\nNearly half of prison admissions in America are due to supervision failures, according to a new study by The Council of State Governments Justice Center. And in 20 states — including Pennsylvania — it’s more than half. In Utah, for example, 79% of prison admissions are the result of supervision failures; in Missouri, 77%. What's more, a quarter of all state prison admissions stem from mere technical violations of supervision. The research shows that people routinely go to prison for breaking even the most innocuous regulations, such as missing appointments with a parole officer. And the cost of this hair-trigger system that punishes people for small slips? State taxpayers pay $2.8 billion each year.\n\nMeek Mill's case shows a broken system\n\nThese admissions are a symptom of a broken supervision system. Probation is promoted as a path out of the criminal justice system — the promise that proper rules and a tight leash can help people stay on the straight and narrow. That’s not how things work.\n\nIn reality, our system keeps the 1 in 55 Americans living under probation entangled with police, courts and corrections institutions. This undermines their ability to work, earn an education and live a healthy, productive life. Instead of a solution to mass incarceration, probation acts as a key contributor.\n\nWe are finally waking up to the fact that we’ve designed our system to do the exact opposite of what we claim we want it to.\n\nProbation reform commentary:As candidates search for criminal justice talking points, parole and probation reform should top the list\n\nThe status quo for community supervision is expensive and ineffective — and things are getting worse. The number of people on probation and parole supervision in the United States has tripled in the past three decades. It is time to refocus supervision on public safety and civic stability rather than aimless and excessive punishment.\n\nThis means sentencing fewer people to probation; implementing alternatives to supervision; capping the length of supervision terms; incentivizing compliance and rewarding behavior change; eliminating or capping incarceration for technical violations that do not involve a new crime; limiting the number and scope of supervision conditions; focusing resources on those with higher risk and needs; and eliminating financial obligations such as supervision fees that perpetuate poverty and create a barrier to success.\n\nIn Mill’s home state of Pennsylvania, the legislature is already debating key reforms. House bill 1555 will cap the length of probationary periods like the majority of states currently do, and Senate bill 14 will incentivize compliance and success while on supervision, so that people don’t have to live under years of judicial scrutiny, and also offer credits for people on probation seeking rehabilitative programs and pursuing their education.\n\nCriminal justice reform in 2020:Do presidential candidates care about criminal justice?\n\nUnlike Meek Mill, most Americans don’t have a network of supportive celebrities and substantial funds to take on a legal fight against our unnecessarily burdensome system of probation. That’s why it is critical that advocates unite to push for reforms in states across the country. It is time we stop laying traps and start providing the support people need to succeed and thrive.\n\nMichael Rubin, Philadelphia 76ers partner, and Laura Arnold, a philanthropist, are founding partners of the REFORM Alliance, along with Meek Mill, Shawn “JAY-Z” Carter, Robert Kraft, Robert Smith, Daniel Loeb, Clara Wu Tsai and Michael Novogratz.

These marshes are home to one of North America’s most endangered mammals: the Amargosa vole.\n\nA mouse-like rodent with cinnamon brown fur and a short tail, the Amargosa vole exists nowhere else on Earth — only in patches of wetlands scattered like islands across the desert east of Death Valley National Park. The wetlands depend on water from the springs, and years of drought have shrunk some of the marshes.\n\nClimate change is projected to bring longer and more severe droughts in the future, threatening the springs and increasing the chances that more of the surviving voles could disappear.\n\n“As climate continues to change, those isolated habitats become more and more precious,” said Patrick Donnelly, executive director of the Amargosa Conservancy, a local environmental group. “And should something happen to even one of those isolated habitats, you may lose an important component of that population.”\n\nThe world is losing creatures at an accelerating rate: Species of frogs, lizards, fish and birds have all gone extinct as their habitats have been fragmented, degraded and destroyed by humans. Now, as the Earth grows warmer due to the burning of fossil fuels, the rapid disruption of the climate is placing even bigger stresses on species that are already struggling to survive.\n\nScientists have warned that unless humans act quickly to protect the natural world from habitat losses and the ravages of climate change, more than a third of all plant and animal species on the planet could disappear by the end of the century.\n\nIn every corner of the United States, animals are threatened by climate change, from chinook salmon in California to the Illinois chorus frog and endangered birds in the rainforests of Hawaii. So many plants and animals are at risk that scientists and conservationists are increasingly calling for new, more ambitious approaches to saving species and habitats.\n\nThose strategies include aggressive interventions to protect species that are on the verge of dying out, and efforts to conserve larger wilderness areas and “corridors” that connect patches of fragmented habitat. There is also a growing push for better data to help prioritize the areas and species that are most vulnerable.\n\nOne of the biggest ways people can help protect species and habitats is to reduce the amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gases we emit. But even if the world stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, some global warming is guaranteed due to the long-lasting carbon dioxide and other gases that humans have already spewed into the atmosphere.\n\nAs habitats shift northward and to higher elevations with global warming, scientists say preventing extinctions will require anticipating the altered conditions and stepping in to protect ecosystems before they unravel.\n\nThe many species that face growing threats due to climate change range from mammals to lizards, fish and birds. As people look to save them, the task of heading off extinctions presents a monumental challenge that will play out over generations and is only just beginning.\n\nAmargosa voles were once much more plentiful in about 50 marsh patches between the towns of Shoshone and Tecopa. But over the past century, people diverted water and dried up some of the marshes to farm and control biting flies. In 1984, the Amargosa vole was listed by the federal government as an endangered species.\n\nNearly three decades later, in 2012, researchers surveyed the marshes near Tecopa and estimated the total remaining population at between 75 and 225 animals. They calculated the odds of extinction at 82 percent over the next five years.\n\nTrying to improve those chances, California wildlife officials trapped 20 juvenile Amargosa voles in 2014 from and took them to the University of California, Davis, to breed in captivity. The captive population has since grown to about 100 voles.\n\nResearchers at the UC Davis facility call it “the colony” or “Tecopa North.” The voles nest in cages filled with straw, and they dig in the dirt outdoors in large plastic tubs, protected from predators behind fences.\n\n“We’re able to breed them very effectively,” said Janet Foley, a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine at Davis who leads the breeding program. Last summer, 12 captive-bred voles were released near Tecopa Hot Springs.\n\nIn order to survive, Amargosa voles need to be surrounded by three-square bulrush. They eat the plant, nest in it and tunnel through it. The plants need to have their roots in water to survive.\n\nIn the heart of the animals’ habitat in Tecopa Marsh, some of the plants have turned brown and died in recent years as the water level has declined, first as a result of maintenance work on culverts in 2006, and then, starting in 2012, as severe drought ravaged the area.\n\nThat created a sort of “one-two punch” that left dead bulrush all around the marsh and led to a decline in the vole population, said Chris Otahal, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Because the dead plants are hindering the regrowth of the marsh, he and other biologists decided to take another major step to intervene.\n\nIn March, they began trapping voles in Tecopa Marsh and relocating them to other marshes. It’s the first step in a project that involves removing the dead bulrush and raising the water level in the marsh. Once the bulrush is replanted and grows back, voles will be released back into the area.\n\n“Ultimately what that’s going to do is create much better habitat,” Otahal said.\n\nTecopa Marsh spreads out around Borehole Spring, a popular hot spring where bathers bob in natural pools. On a recent afternoon, several bathers soaked in the ponds while Noel Ludwig, a hydrologist with the Bureau of Land Management, walked into the marsh to download data from instruments that measure the water level and temperature.\n\n“The water is the first big critical thing. If there’s no water, there’s no voles,” Ludwig said. “Most climate models predict that the Southwest overall is going to get drier over the next half century. And given how dry it already is, that is a concern for anything that depends on water.”\n\nOne of the marshes with a relatively ample water supply is Shoshone Spring. Amargosa voles used to live in the marsh, but they disappeared over the years as people diverted water and allowed invasive plants to replace the native bulrush.\n\nIn order to restore the marsh in Shoshone, researchers recently cleared away the overgrown vegetation, preparing to recreate the natural habitat. As soon as native bulrush grows back in about a year and a half, state and federal officials plan to reintroduce a group of captive-bred Amargosa voles from UC Davis.\n\nSusan Sorrells, a landowner and environmentalist whose great-grandfather founded Shoshone more than a century ago, said she’s delighted to have the habitat restoration project occurring on her property.\n\n“We’re really looking forward to returning it to that natural state,” Sorrells said, standing beside the newly cleared land, where a brown stubble remained from the plants that were chopped down and removed.\n\nSorrells is the founder of the Amargosa Conservancy, and she previously helped lead an effort that brought the tiny Shoshone pupfish back from the brink of extinction. In a pool downstream from the spring, tourists can now see male pupfish, bright blue and less than two inches long, darting about among the brown female fish.\n\n“I’m hoping that the vole will be like the pupfish. It’ll go from being endangered to not even being threatened,” Sorrells said. “That’s the hope we all have.”\n\nAllan Muth and Mark Fisher know their lizards. For 31 years, they’ve been conducting research together in the desert near Palm Springs, methodically counting Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizards and collecting a wealth of data.\n\nThey’ve taken DNA samples, examined the sand dunes where the lizards live and produced studies that have helped guide plans to protect habitat for the species.\n\nThe Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard is classified as threatened by the federal government and listed as endangered by the state of California. The lizards have lost portions of their habitat to development, and global warming is likely to render more of the remaining habitat unlivable for the lizards.\n\nThe reptiles can burrow into the sand to escape the heat of the day, but they only burrow down to a maximum of 4 inches, Muth said. As temperatures climb, fringe-toed lizards could be pushed beyond their limits, especially in the hotter and drier lower-elevation areas of the eastern Coachella Valley, which is already one of the hottest places in the country.\n\nMuth and Fisher hope the lizards will fare somewhat better at slightly higher elevations in the western portion of the valley, where they expect enough plants will remain for the animals to have the food and cover they need to survive.\n\nREAD MORE : How climate change is altering the deserts of the Southwest\n\n“All we can do is try to decrease the threats to the animal and to its habitat. You’ll never have all the information you need, and what you have to do is act on the best science that’s available, with the data that you have, and make a guess,” Muth said. He’s optimistic that efforts to set aside habitat will help the species survive.\n\nVisiting one of their research sites last month, Muth and Fisher walked across the desert looking for Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizards among boulders and windblown creosote bushes. Each of them carried a “lizard noose,” a tool made from a fishing pole with the guides cut off and a piece of braided fishing line tied to the end. The line — sometimes they use a piece of silk suture thread — dangles down to a loop that they use to catch lizards.\n\nHolding their poles, the two scientists tapped on the bushes as they walked past, trying to spur lizards out into the open. In front of them, lizards darted across the sand taking cover. Most of them were another species, the desert iguana.\n\nThen they spotted a Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard: a juvenile male. Slipping the noose over the lizard, Fisher held it in his hand and announced: “Got him.”\n\n“He’s probably last year’s hatchling,” Muth said.\n\nFisher held out the scaly fringes on the lizard’s toes. Then he used clippers to snip off the tip of a toe. He said it doesn’t injure the lizard, but the mark helps identify the animal and the piece of toe can be used to extract DNA. Fisher slipped the piece he had cut into a vial.\n\nUsing a marker, he wrote a number on the lizard’s back: 1,777. That’s how many fringe-toed lizards they’ve counted in their research. When Fisher set down the lizard, it raced into a bush and disappeared.\n\nThe information the two herpetologists have jotted down in notebooks will provide a baseline for scientists to spot changes in the future as the climate grows hotter. Muth said they’ve also collected data about the genetic makeup of separate lizard populations in three natural reserves. The genetic data could help inform decisions about moving some of the lizards from one location to another, if that sort of intervention is eventually deemed necessary.\n\nThe fringe-toed lizard is one of 27 species, along with the desert tortoise and Peninsular bighorn sheep, that are targeted for protection under the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan. The plan, which permits development in some areas while setting aside other areas as open space, has established a system in which development impact fees are used to pay for the acquisition of additional lands for conservation areas.\n\nMuth said one of his worries is that some key wildlife “corridors,” which could have allowed animals to move to more suitable habitats as the climate warms up, have already been lost. Muth is the director of the Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center near Indian Wells. The research site is one of 39 natural reserves operated by the University of California. Covering more than 6,000 acres, the Deep Canyon reserve stretches from the alluvial fan at the base of the canyon up the steep, rugged mountainsides to an elevation of about 4,000 feet.\n\nFor visiting scientists, Deep Canyon is a prime spot for research on how climate change is altering desert ecosystems.\n\nOn a recent morning, Rafael Lara, a postdoctoral researcher from the University of California, Santa Cruz, inserted instruments into finger-sized sections of PVC pipe. The pieces of pipe, with corks on both ends, are roughly the same size as lizards. These faux lizards are used to measure temperatures in specific locations, such as on top of rocks or in the shade of bushes. With data from dozens of these model lizards, Lara said his team will gain insights into how global warming is affecting lizards in Deep Canyon.\n\n“The idea is to have a very specific map with all the temperatures,” Lara said. He said the research will also help indicate which species of lizards are most vulnerable to warming.\n\nOther species of lizards that Lara has studied have already gone extinct in Mexico.\n\nIn a 2010 study, Lara and a research team led by UC Santa Cruz professor Barry Sinervo examined extinctions of lizards resulting from climate change. They assessed 48 species of Mexican lizards and found that 12 percent of local populations had gone extinct since 1975. They also estimated that based on current trends, 20 percent of the world’s lizard species could disappear by 2080.\n\nThe warming at Deep Canyon during the past half-century illustrates how rapidly the changes are occurring. Weather records from 1962 to 1971 show an average high temperature of 80.6 degrees. During the 10 years ending in 2015, the average high was 87.8 degrees, more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter.\n\n“We’re in a new ballgame because it’s changing so fast now,” said Laurel Fox, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. She was working alongside Lara setting up instruments to measure the temperature and moisture at the soil level and up to three meters off the ground.\n\n“In order to protect species, we have to know a lot about them,” said Fox, who is co-director of the Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts. She said research across the UC system of natural reserves will help provide a great deal more information. Still, she said, trying to protect species imperiled by climate change presents immense challenges.\n\n“I think almost everything is going to be threatened by climate change one way or another, unless they can adapt,” Fox said. “We know that lizards are affected, mammals are affected, butterflies are affected, a whole host of animals and plants.\"\n\nBecause the changes in climate will play out over decades, she said, those shifts will make the work of conservation extremely difficult. “I think what we need to do as scientists is to work with social scientists and policymakers to try to come up with long-term plans for how to deal with these issues.”\n\nScientists have estimated that the current rate of extinction is about 1,000 times the rate of extinction before the development of human civilization. That points to what many now describe as the looming “Sixth Extinction,” a term that has been increasingly used since Richard E. Leakey and Roger Lewin published their 1995 book The Sixth Extinction: Patterns of Life and the Future of Humankind.\n\nThe fifth mass extinction occurred 65 million years ago and is thought to have been caused by an asteroid that slammed into the Earth, wiping out the last of the dinosaurs.\n\nThis time, scientists say humans have become the main destructive force. And unless people take bigger steps to counteract that trend, the losses of species are projected to accelerate as temperatures climb.\n\nIn an era of climate change, conservationists might turn to Wayne Gretzky for advice.\n\nSo says Clint Muhlfeld, an ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey based in Glacier National Park, in Montana’s Rocky Mountains. Global warming is melting the glaciers that give the park its name — many of which could disappear within a few decades — but Muhlfeld is working on a slightly different problem: how rising temperatures are impacting fish, including the bull trout.\n\nLike many animals harmed by climate change, bull trout already face several threats, including habitat degradation caused by logging, agriculture and other human activities. In 1998, the federal government listed the species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBull trout are found in five Western states. But the danger is especially great in Glacier National Park, where an explosion of invasive, non-native lake trout has decimated bull trout populations.\n\n“The bull trout had been there for millennia, surviving cataclysmic occurrences like wildfires, flooding, extreme temperature events, glaciation,” Muhlfeld said. “But these invasive lake trout have been moving in, and have invaded several lakes. Bull trout populations have tanked. They’ve declined to the point of functionally extinct, in several lakes.”\n\nREAD MORE: Climate change far more than an environmental issue\n\nRising temperatures are making matters worse. Partly due to global warming, there’s less snow in the mountains than there was in the past, and the snowpack is melting earlier than usual, Muhlfeld said. The results are warmer water in the spring and summer, increased flooding in the fall and winter, and potentially much less water at times. All of those changes are expected to harm the bull trout, which has evolved to live in cold water.\n\nSo Muhlfeld has been working on a solution: physically moving the bull trout to new locations.\n\nSpecies relocations are as controversial as they are rare. Scientists worry that moving species in some cases could accidentally disrupt delicate ecosystems. Some critics question the morality of human beings taking animals out of their natural habitats and deciding where to put them.\n\nMuhlfeld said traditional conservation — including habitat protection — is more important than ever. But as human-caused climate change takes its toll, he believes people will increasingly need to think about picking up threatened animals and taking them somewhere safer.\n\n“This is just one tool in the toolbox that managers can use in extreme cases, to save a species or population from decline. And it’s not one size fits all,” he said. But in the case of bull trout, he added, “Now is a time to go out on a limb and take a chance in some of these locations, or we’ll have nothing left.”\n\nA few years ago, Muhlfeld’s team moved 111 young bull trout to a new home, saving that particular population from likely extinction at the hands of the invasive lake trout. Researchers went back to the fishes’ old home a year later and found just one juvenile bull trout, leading them to believe they had moved the population just in time.\n\nThe key to the relocation project, Muhlfeld said, is finding safe new locations. In part, that means places where the new residents won’t disrupt existing ecosystems. Just as importantly, it means places that are expected to provide stable habitat even as the climate changes. Muhlfeld’s team has identified areas high in the mountains as the best choices, because that’s where the snowpack and cooler water temperatures are likely to persist longer.\n\n“From a climate context, those are the key ingredients that these species need,” Muhlfeld said.\n\nHence the nod to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, who famously said, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”\n\nConservationists need to take a similar approach to climate change, Muhlfeld said, by anticipating how ecosystems will look decades from now.\n\n“Managers need to think bigger picture over larger timeframes, and not be in this reactionary mode,” he said. “They need to think about where the system’s going, not where it’s been.”\n\nYou might think birds could deal with climate change pretty easily. If their habitats are threatened, they can just fly somewhere new, right?\n\nIt’s not so simple.\n\nIn a 2014 report, Audubon Society scientists found that 314 North American bird species — more than half of the 588 they studied — could lose at least half of their current ranges by 2080. The environmental group described 126 of those species as “climate endangered,” meaning they’re likely to lose at least half of their ranges by 2050 if global warming continues unabated.\n\nFor many of those birds, picking up and relocating might not be an option.\n\nGary Langham, the Audubon Society’s chief scientist, cited the bobolink — a small blackbird that spends its summers across the northern United States, and its winters in South America — as an example. Audubon scientists say the bobolink could lose 80 percent of its current range by 2080, as rising temperatures push its desired climate conditions northward into Canada.\n\nPODCAST: Listen to the KCOD podcast ‘Earth NOW’\n\nThe bobolink’s ideal climate zone could actually grow by more than 50 percent, even as the zone shifts northward. The problem, Langham said, is that much of that northern land is covered by boreal forest, rather than the grassland habitat the bobolink needs. It’s possible the bird will start migrating further north only to find the habitat conditions unfamiliar and unhelpful, he said.\n\n“Even though the bird can move easily — it can fly to Argentina and back, after all — it still has to be able to make a nest, to feed its young, to do everything it can do now,” Langham said. “It’s supposed to be doing that in an open country habitat, and the boreal forest is not going to be able to shift very quickly, if at all.”\n\nMany birds could face similar dilemmas, making it difficult to know how many of the 314 at-risk bird species identified by the Audubon Society will be able to adapt to climate change. Like many animals, Langham said, birds have spent centuries, if not millennia, adapting to specific environmental conditions.\n\n“Plants and animals that are in Palm Springs right now, for example, couldn’t just live in the Arctic,” he said. “The natural environment is a very competitive place, and that leads to plants and animals being tightly connected to and adapted to the temperatures and precipitation and water levels that are in their environment. They get to be very, very good at doing what they do where they live.”\n\nThe best thing people can do to help birds cope with climate change, Langham said, is to limit the carbon emissions that are causing temperatures to rise. But there are also steps human beings can take to help birds adapt to the changes, including doubling down on traditional habitat conservation.\n\nIn Hawaii, for instance, the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is working on a reforesting project that could help endangered birds cope with the impacts of climate change.\n\nFor decades, refuge officials have been planting trees at high elevations on the dormant Mauna Kea volcano, trying to restore forests that were logged and grazed. The planting creates more habitat for forest birds like the Hawaii creeper, the Hawaii ‘akepa and the akiapōlā‘au, all of which are listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\n“They’re forest birds. They need a forest. They need the shelter, they need the trees to nest in. They also need the food,” said Steve Kendall, a wildlife biologist at the Hakalau refuge.\n\nIn recent years, global warming has given new urgency to reforestation: As temperatures have risen, non-native mosquitoes have moved further and further up Hawaii’s mountains, spreading avian malaria that has devastated bird populations. Some birds might be able to escape the mosquitoes by moving upslope into cooler areas. But in the Hakalau refuge, they can only go so far before trees give ways to open pasture. So the further upslope refuge officials can plant trees, the more likely it is that endangered forest birds will be able to escape the deadly mosquitoes.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Where the presidential candidates stand on climate\n\nThe Audubon Society, meanwhile, is working to identify “climate strongholds” for particular bird species: places where scientists expect climate conditions to remain relatively stable. The group hopes to find the most stable spots for each climate-threatened species, and to work with land managers to ensure those places are protected.\n\n“We want to focus on places that are less likely to change in the face of all this shifting around,” Langham said. “If you bet on places that are more stable than others, it’s more likely to have a good return on investment.”\n\nMany environmentalists say people have a moral obligation to take action to save species, simply because each one of them is a precious piece of the whole and has an intrinsic right to exist. But there are also implications for human beings as more species are lost and ecosystems are degraded.\n\nFor example, a growing number of bees and other pollinators are being pushed toward extinction, putting food supplies at risk. Shellfish are threatened by the rising acidification of the oceans, and coral reefs have also been dying in places from Australia to the Caribbean. In national forests and parks across the western United States, millions of pine trees have died as rising temperatures and years of drought have allowed bark beetles to flourish.\n\nREAD MORE: The new climate rallying cry: keep it in the ground\n\nIn many ways, humans are deeply intertwined with the natural ecosystems that are now under assault.\n\n“The diversity of life is what helps to make our life rich. Even if someone might not encounter an endangered species or have an opportunity to take a picture of it for Instagram, the human species is part of nature, and we depend on nature for our survival,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, the country’s largest environmental group. “So we need to make sure our natural environment is preserved simply for our own personal self-interest. But beyond that, I think it’s important to keep wonder in our lives, and to recognize that there are things that are bigger than us — whether it’s gazing up at the stars on a camping trip, or encountering uncommon species on a hike.”\n\nBetween 1908 and the 1930s, biologist Joseph Grinnell led hundreds of research expeditions into the wilds of California. He was the director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, and in the wilderness he and his students and colleagues collected animals as specimens for the museum. They also methodically took notes about the wildlife they saw.\n\nMore than a decade ago, scientists began a project to retrace Grinnell’s steps and revisit the locations he studied in order to describe the changes that have occurred since. What they’ve found in the Sierra Nevada mountains points to the impacts of warming: Some types of chipmunks and ground squirrels, for instance, have shifted upslope and are now found at higher elevations.\n\n“Species are moving around quite a bit,” said Steve Beissinger, a professor of conservation biology at UC Berkeley who leads the Grinnell Resurvey Project.\n\nSome species have shifted uphill in the mountains, which allows them to remain in a similar temperature zone as the climate gets warmer. Alpine chipmunks, for instance, have moved upslope and their range has shrunk significantly since Grinnell’s time, Beissinger said. On the other hand, he said, the lodgepole chipmunk has stayed in the same areas where it was found a century ago.\n\n“When we look across all species, we see that they are responding with a lot of variation,” Beissinger said. “The vast majority will probably wind up moving in some way.”\n\nThe species that aren’t able to move or adapt quickly enough will probably be the ones that go extinct. And as animals disappear from the food web as predators or prey, entire ecosystems can be thrown out of balance.\n\nREAD MORE:Researchers map springs across the Mojave Desert\n\nTrained scientists aren’t the only ones who can help spot those changes in the environment. Now anyone can be a citizen scientist and contribute by pulling out a phone, snapping a photo of a plant or animal, and sharing the sighting online. One venue is iNaturalist, a social network run by a team at the California Academy of Sciences that allows users to post photos and crowdsources data on when and where species are spotted.\n\n“It’s bringing the natural world into focus like we haven’t seen, but it’s doing it through this giant connected community of naturalists teaching one another,” said Scott Loarie, co-director of the social media site. “What’s cool is that you can think from a scientific perspective, ‘Wow, it’s creating all this data that we really need,’ but you also think it’s actually just connecting people and getting them engaged with nature, which is valuable in its own right as well.”\n\nTo date, more than 178,000 people have signed up for iNaturalist. They have made more than 2.3 million observations, logging more than 90,100 species.\n\n“If we can keep things growing at the rate that things are growing, by 2020 we’ll have a system where every month we’ll have 75 percent of all vertebrates in the world sort of check in, so you could say month to month, ‘What’s the real status?’” Loarie said. “Like a real-time census of the health of plants and animals around the world, which is really exciting.”\n\nThe data can point to problems if sightings of certain species drop off. Users also can pick up on changes that are “going under the radar,” Loarie said. For instance, last year a 10-year-old girl spotted a bird on a power line in Los Angeles and snapped a photo. It turned out to be a social flycatcher, which normally is found between northern Argentina and Mexico. The sighting was recognized as the first ever recorded in California.\n\n“If we can just unlock the ability for everyday people to collect this kind of data, we can collect it at a much bigger scale,” Loarie said. With global warming progressing rapidly, he said, time is of the essence.\n\n“We need to come up with a system to very quickly tackle the scale of this,” he said. “We really need to know where plants and animals are, how their distributions are changing, and which ones are going extinct, where and why. And we need to kind of do this in the next decade or so.”\n\nWhen the renowned biologist Edward O. Wilson recently presented his vision for confronting the extinction crisis, he set a bold, ambitious goal: to set aside half of the Earth for nature.\n\n“Unless humanity learns a great deal more about global biodiversity and moves quickly to protect it, we will soon lose most of the species composing life on Earth,” Wilson wrote in his book Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life. “I am convinced that only by setting aside half the planet in reserve, or more, can we save the living part of the environment and achieve the stabilization required for our own survival.”\n\nIn his appeal, Wilson called for people to strive against the odds toward that simple goal in order reduce the number of extinctions.\n\n“The biosphere does not belong to us; we belong to it,” Wilson wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: What global warming means for water supplies\n\nLoarie said he thinks Wilson’s goal raises important questions: If nature needs half the planet, which half should it be? And how can those areas be targeted? Better data on species and where they are found can help answer those questions.\n\nStuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University, has examined the question of just how attainable Wilson’s goal might be, and he sees reasons to be hopeful. In an article about Wilson’s proposal in the journal Nature, Pimm pointed out that large tracts of desert lands, the Amazon rainforest and boreal forests are already effectively protected due to their remoteness. He said the challenge will be to safeguard areas around cities, or areas such as grasslands that can easily be turned into grazing lands for livestock.\n\nHe also cited stats that he said show the world’s progress: In the mid-1970s, about 1.9 million square miles of lands were protected in parks and other wilderness areas. Now, that has grown to about 6.5 million square miles.\n\nThat’s about 13 percent of the planet’s roughly 50 million square miles of land area that isn’t covered by ice.\n\n“My sense is that we probably can get to pretty close to half. The challenge is to get the half that we want,” Pimm said in an interview. “And that’s going to be difficult.”\n\nStill, he said he thinks there is a reasonable chance that in the decades to come Wilson’s vision can be achieved.\n\nPimm said he wouldn’t argue with some of the scientific projections that more than a third of all species could be lost by the end of this century. But he said he prefers to focus on solutions.\n\n“There’s really an awful lot we can do,” he said. “The end of the century is 85 years from now, and I hope we smarten up.”\n\nIan James writes about water and the environment for The Desert Sun.

Build an impenetrable wall and no female or male cat will make it into the United States. The species will go extinct in this country.\n\nBut the jaguar's story is bigger than a wall. In Mexico, the cat faces many of the same threats its ancestors did in the United States a century ago. Ranchers see the jaguar as a livestock-killing predator. Roads and development are fragmenting the habitat. The food chain weakens as people alter the landscape.\n\nBefore the jaguar can return to Arizona and New Mexico, it will have to survive south of the border. Conservationists are trying to protect the cat's hunting grounds, trying to persuade ranchers to share the land. And biologists say if the habitat can sustain the jaguar, the rest of the ecosystem will have a better shot at survival.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nOcelots try to survive as habitat disappears\n\n\n\nIn this country, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists the jaguar as endangered and is completing a species-recovery plan. Within the U.S., the agency’s draft plan — proposed a month before Trump took office — focuses on maintaining connections to Mexico.\n\nWithout a wall, there are currently at least seven crucial wilderness crossings that a migrating Mexican jaguar could pad along to meet her mate.\n\nBut any structure impervious to humans would also turn back big cats. For the jaguar — the region’s “apex predator” — sealing the border would seal its fate in this country.\n\nConservation biologists don’t usually speak with such black-and-white clarity about individual threats to wildlife, but on this point there is broad consensus. Jaguars and people are known to cross the border in the same mountains. Building an unbroken barrier to stop the people means extinction in America for the jaguar.\n\nAn American dilemma\n\nAmerica’s borderlands are surprisingly diverse environments, with mountainous “sky island” forests looming above an arid sea of grasslands and cactus crusts, cut through with a few improbable river oases. It’s a series of interconnected ecosystems supporting some of the country’s richest animal varieties, all in a delicate balance that humans love but also change.\n\nThe jaguar's precarious frontier wanderings remain a hint of what's still possible on both sides of the border. Its place atop the region's wildland hierarchy is undisputed, but unsecured.\n\nIncreasing protections for Mexico’s jaguars and their mountainous paths to old stalking grounds in Arizona and New Mexico could eventually cause the big cats to expand their turf, said big-cat expert Howard Quigley, who advised the government on its recovery plan and directs jaguar and mountain lion programs for the international cat conservation group Panthera.\n\nThere is “no doubt in my mind” they could then resume breeding in the country that hounded them to oblivion last century, he said.\n\n\"The wall would eliminate that possibility.\"\n\nThat’s a tradeoff some border residents want.\n\nArivaca rancher Jim Chilton said motion-sensing cameras photographed 350 migrants carrying bundles — presumably drugs — across his ranch northwest of Nogales last year. Americans must choose between national security and wildlife crossings, he believes.\n\n“You can’t have both,” he said.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT | THE WALL\n\n2,000-mile journey in shadow of border wall\n\nThe wall that will make a human smuggler rich\n\nBorder crossers, and the wall that won't stop them\n\nNo fence has stopped drug traffickers at border\n\nBorder ranchers, in a world without a wall\n\nIt’s not exactly a global existential question for a rippling, human-size spotted cat with jaws that can crush a mountain lion’s skull. The jaguar inhabits a more or less continuous band from the Sonoran Desert’s sky island mountains through Central and South American tropical jungles and into northern Argentina.\n\nThe species, Panthera onca, can survive without Arizona’s oak woodlands fringe.\n\nThe question is whether the United States is a lesser country without “el tigre,” its original bad hombre.\n\nWherever they live, jaguars are more than just a curiosity. They are a sign of health for all things, because they top their food chain. Requiring big and relatively wild country, abundant prey and clean water, their very existence indicates a landscape's continuing ecological integrity.\n\nThe government could build in wildlife crossings on remote stretches of the border, and evidence from farther south in jaguar range suggests the animals can negotiate human structures, Quigley said. If Arizona’s would-be pioneering female ran into a wall, she might probe it for an opening instead of turning back.\n\nBut anything big enough for a jaguar is also big enough for a human.\n\nGallery: Border wildlife\n\nMissing a part of itself\n\nRandy Young lives among the big cats about 120 miles south of the border, even if he only ever sees them via motion-triggered camera traps.\n\nA dual citizen, he works there, in the heart of Sonora’s jaguar country. It’s a hideout in a hilly frontier of thornscrub and semi-arid tropical woodlands with twilight vistas of a dozen peaks that have never seen an electric light.\n\nIt is seclusion and abundance like this that make Arizona an afterthought in global jaguar conservation. Northwestern Mexico remains a jaguar breeding ground, with more than 500 of the cats living between Sonora and its southern neighbor, the Sinaloa state.\n\nTo Young, this a reservoir for recovery from which jaguars may multiply and move out, perhaps to the north. He manages the Northern Jaguar Reserve, a remote 55,000-acre Mexican conservation outpost that he manages for the Tucson-based Northern Jaguar Project.\n\nHe knows the jaguar’s powers.\n\nHe believes Arizona is missing a part of itself.\n\nHe recalls a night at the reserve when he heard the only New World cat that roars, a rasp often described as a quickening “uh-uh-uh” bellow. It was the predator that Mexicans know colloquially as el tigre, or the tiger, though it is not known to eat humans like its more feared and endangered Asian cousin.\n\nThat roar in the dark was a rare direct contact, the cat announcing his dominance.\n\nDuring another visit, Young drove over a rise and spied a turkey vulture stooped over a bloodied and dead mountain lion, the back of its neck and head showing telltale jaguar crunches. The bone-smashing jaguar is the rare cat that does not usually go for the throat.\n\nYoung would eventually display the perforated skull at his home in Sahuaripa.\n\nBig cat experts say such a territorial fight is rare, that rivals generally mark their turf to avoid run-ins that can be fatal even for the victor if a battle scar becomes infected. To Young, though, the skull symbolizes centuries of awe throughout the Americas.\n\nVideo: The last cat\n\nAn ambivalent homeland\n\nFor a long time, America was out to get jaguars and any other predators that threatened the lambs and calves that poured into the Southwest with the settlers.\n\nAs Arizona and New Mexico entered the Union in 1912, settlers viewed meat eaters as competition. By then, New Mexico already had killed the last jaguar it would confirm for nearly 90 years. Arizona at statehood had yet to extirpate some two dozen jaguars along a 200-mile highland arc.\n\nStarting in 1915, the U.S. Biological Survey, a forerunner of today’s Fish and Wildlife Service, started helping ranchers and homesteaders protect their flocks from jaguars. Its agents hunted, trapped and poisoned cats, while the states paid bounty hunters.\n\nSEE ALSO:How wall could silence endangered species\n\nAgents worked under the motto “bring them in no matter how,” according to “Borderland Jaguars,” a 2001 science and pioneer literature review by Arizona State University biologist David Brown and Mexican jaguar expert Carlos Lopez Gonzalez.\n\nThe authors left it to readers to decide whether Arizona and New Mexico had hosted a thriving breeding population in the century before extirpation. They found the record unclear, and noted evidence that hunting guides may have captured a few of the jaguars in Sonora and released them in Arizona.\n\nBut their listing of cat killings from the border and the sky islands up through the Mogollon Rim to the Grand Canyon made clear a dwindling incidence of females before the last one succumbed more than half a century ago.\n\nFor years, wildlife managers believed the jaguar had gone extinct in this country, but in 1996 two houndsmen, one in New Mexico’s Peloncillo Mountains and one in Arizona’s Baboquivari Mountains, inadvertently treed separate male jaguars and photographed them before letting them go.\n\nWith evidence of the jaguar's continued survival, U.S. biologists sought to protect the cats under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nArizona balked at the potential bureaucratic hindrances to land use that could come with new federal protections, but the following year the U.S. added jaguars to the list of animals it safeguards within its boundaries.\n\nIn a draft recovery plan, the Fish and Wildlife Service established jaguar “critical habitat” in the sky islands.\n\nArizona objected. While still protecting jaguars from hunting, state game officials argued in 2013 that nothing in the state could be considered “critical” to survival of a species that lives almost exclusively south of the border.\n\n“Recovery of the jaguar is completely dependent on conservation within the 99% of its range that lie outside of the United States,” the Arizona Game and Fish Department wrote to its federal counterparts in 2013.\n\nMan and myth\n\nMany cultures celebrate the jaguar as a mythic creature symbolizing wildness and strength, Young said. “And possibly savagery.”\n\nThe Olmec culture on the Gulf of Mexico considered the jaguar a cave god controlling the land and earthquakes and, later, the cat figured in Aztec creation stories.\n\nYoung is the rare 21st century professional jack-of-all-trades, by turns professional auto mechanic, sculptor, homebuilder, inventor and outdoor adventure guide.\n\nOver the last two years, he has parlayed each of these skills into a job he calls the most fulfilling of his 44 years. He is preserving wilderness for its animal and human inhabitants and fostering trans-border respect for a noble beast.\n\nHe’s also fixing roads by hand, maintaining equipment and creating art for the cause.\n\nIt’s a calling he didn’t know was beckoning until a friend invited him on a weeklong mountain-biking trip from Sahuaripa to the reserve with the jaguar project’s Tucson-based director, who happened to be looking for a reserve manager.\n\nYoung was tiring of his latest jobs in the city, contracting and metalworking, and wanted to get closer to nature.\n\nHe found himself pedaling past townsfolk selling vegetables from wheelbarrows, grinding up the dirt roads and peering over cliffs across rows of mountains with no one on them. He camped under the stars and pondered the privilege of living in a place where big cats of several species outnumbered people for miles around.\n\n“This is way better,” he figured. “Way more of a purpose.”\n\nIt doesn’t pay so great, and he has to find occasional odd jobs when he’s back in Tucson.\n\n“There’s lots of people that make life sacrifices for a job they hate,” he said. “I’m making job sacrifices for a life I love.”\n\nHe would replant native grass seeds to maximize deer health and would round up cattle trespassing onto the reserve to eat that grass. He would protect creeks and ponds from which jaguars rarely wander more than a dozen miles or so.\n\nHe would make it his passion to save the cat at the top of his home continent’s food chain, thereby saving everything under it — all the plants, animals and waters that any species, including humans, could need from their environment.\n\nA worthy neighbor\n\nSahuaripa is a cow town of a few thousand people in low-slung adobe homes, some of which date to the 1600s, fortified with newer flagstone facades.\n\nRanch families with charcoal-stoked grill carts sling local beef tacos and tripe tostadas in the evenings. Life and commerce revolve around the cattle that share the surrounding mountains with jaguars and ocelots.\n\nYoung stands out around town, a strapping, bald figure with spangled sunglasses and mutton-chop sideburns. He knows he appears American, though his mother is Mexican and he grew up in both Chihuahua and New Mexico.\n\nOn street corners, he stops to engage people in Spanish about their families, their town government and their street’s potholes.\n\nHe wants them to know the jaguar man is part of the community, so that maybe they’ll consider the jaguar a worthy neighbor. The first step in establishing a jaguar population north of the border is to protect and grow the cat’s numbers here.\n\nAround town, he has overseen mural paintings in homage to the majestic native cats and has guided summer camps teaching local kids about their ecology. He hopes to start an annual music and art festival blending the species and town names into “Jaguaripa” and invite musicians and artists from Tucson to show Mexicans how much Americans appreciate the animals.\n\nEach fall, he returns to Tucson to lead a thousands-strong All Souls Procession of mourners celebrating the lives of the departed, always wearing a mask he has sculpted. Last year, he wore a jaguar head that he molded in clay and then cast in urethane and hung from a welder’s mask on his brow.\n\nIn Tucson, his goal is to stoke enthusiasm for a wild visitor that might recolonize Arizona if allowed. He wants them to imagine the day the female jaguar in Mexico sets out from his backyard, bound for theirs.\n\nInfusing the spirit of the cat\n\nIn Sahuaripa, the plan is to create a generation that might accept jaguars as the ultimate indicators of environmental health instead of fearing and persecuting them.\n\n“If I can get the town to identify with Jaguaripa at all, that’s a big coup in guerrilla marketing,” Young said. “If I can get people to take pride and wear the (jaguar) shirts and stuff, I won.”\n\nThe county’s economic development director is on board. Carlos Martinez used another rare Sahuaripa resource to explain why preserving the environment is in everyone’s interest.\n\nOld-timers made and sold barrel cactus candy, he said, until they hacked down practically every barrel cactus in the county doing it. Suddenly, candy production ceased. Then the deer and javelina that once enjoyed cactus fruit declined.\n\n“That made the jaguar eat more cattle,” he said.\n\nYounger residents see losing native plants and animals as a problem, he said.\n\nIn Sahuaripa and in Sonora’s metropolitan capital of Hermosillo, environmental educator Santa Napoles with the non-profit Conciencia works to build support for coexistence. In the jaguar hills, she tells tomorrow’s cowboys and cowgirls how saving their whole environment is the best way to reduce predator conflicts. In the big city, she preaches saving jaguars to protect a healthy environment for humans.\n\n“When you find a jaguar in one place, that means that ecosystem is complete, it’s healthy,” she said. Jaguars need clean air, water and food, “all stuff we need also.”\n\nCaptive genes\n\nA captive jaguar family at Hermosillo’s zoo, Centro Ecologico de Sonora, provides city dwellers with both a hint at their country’s wild majesty and a lesson in the conflicts on the ranches.\n\nA rancher trapped a Sonoran jaguar years ago but took pity when he saw it and did not shoot it. The cat had ruined his teeth by gnawing on the trap’s steel cage and could not return to a life hunting wild prey.\n\nFor a time, the Phoenix Zoo fed and cared for him and then sent him to Hermosillo, where he has since bred with a female from Chiapas and produced two cubs. In March, Napoles, the educator, visited the youngest, a 6-month-old female named Tutu’uli, the Yaqui word for beautiful.\n\nHer handlers turned her loose to romp in the grass and pounce at fish in a pond at a natural area behind the visitor exhibits. She crouched and launched herself at a zookeeper’s thigh, playing with claws retracted.\n\nShe’s being groomed as a people pleaser, but her genes may yet bolster the wild cats if breeders can isolate her cubs from human contact.\n\n“She can be enthusiastic about the hunt,” Napoles said, something her older brother — a 110-pound juvenile who cuddles with his keepers — has lost. The hunting instinct, along with Tutu’uli’s fondness for water, make her a good candidate for breeding cubs for potential reintroduction to the mountains.\n\n“They have a lot of hope that her descendants may be released in the wild,” Napoles said.\n\nA plan for recovery\n\nMaps in a U.S. courtroom can matter as much to species conservation as the habitat itself. Only a lawsuit and a federal judge could define the jaguar’s territory in a state where it scarcely lives anymore.\n\nArizona Game and Fish supports jaguar conservation and the Endangered Species Act, state officials told their federal counterparts, but calling unoccupied territory essential to recovery “will lead to erosion of current conservation efforts by confusing and alienating conservation partners” north and south of the border.\n\nFederal biologists, on a judge’s order, nonetheless outlined nearly 1,200 square miles of critical jaguar habitat in wooded or scrubby mountains of southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. The designation gives Fish and Wildlife review powers for major projects occurring on those federal lands.\n\nThe draft plan that biologists are considering leaves unanswered a question that most such species goals address: It doesn’t say how many jaguars should live in the U.S. before the country can consider them no longer endangered.\n\nInstead, the plan relies mostly on measuring population health and increasing numbers and distribution in Mexico, while maintaining at least two trans-border crossings free of barriers and with sufficient protected habitat to entice traversing jaguars.\n\nA continuous wall, if that’s what the U.S. builds, would by definition kill the recovery.\n\n“Fences designed to prevent the passage of humans across the border also prevent passage of jaguars,” according to the draft recovery plan. That “would likely adversely affect the presence and persistence of jaguars in the U.S.”\n\nNormally, conservationists could use the Endangered Species Act in a legal fight to thwart big projects that a judge might decide imperils a listed species. But with the 2005 REAL ID Act, Congress authorized the Department of Homeland Security to override all competing laws in securing the border.\n\nMany who doubt a wall’s effectiveness in stopping human movements say wildlife is collateral damage in a pointless border war.\n\n“I’m super concerned,” said Tadeo Pfister, who grew up in Nogales and is a Sky Island Alliance program manager working with Mexican organizations to help preserve border wildlife corridors. “And I don’t think it’s going to do anything for our national security.\n\n“We could work together with (Mexico) for a fraction of what it costs, this silly wall.”\n\nA friend or a foe?\n\nSahuaripa County’s ranches are rustic by American standards. They lack electricity and running water. Cowboys ride them on horseback and corral cattle in pens woven from mesquite trunks and limbs.\n\nUntil the Northern Jaguar Project’s hired hands started trucking in latrines — a sight that led skeptical cowboys to accuse them of transplanting and releasing jaguars from the boxes — there were few outhouses. The program offers them as a favor to ranchers and as an environmental upgrade for the arroyos that send water toward its own reserve.\n\nThe Northern Jaguar Project also makes coexistence financially rewarding for participating ranchers. It pays for evidence of prowlers on their land.\n\nA rancher’s first instinct has long been to trap or shoot a jaguar before it can kill a calf. It’s the same instinct that led U.S. agents to hunt and essentially eradicate jaguars from the Southwest from the early- to mid-20th century.\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Northern Jaguar Project has worked to reverse the instinct.\n\nThe group’s biologists have strapped motion-sensing trail cameras to trees on lands owned by willing Mexican ranchers and rewarded them for every jaguar, ocelot, mountain lion or bobcat photographed in any given 24-hour period.\n\nA jaguar photo is worth most: 5,000 pesos, or about $260. Bobcats are worth a tenth that, while the others are valued in between.\n\nThe reward is meant to approximate what a rancher might otherwise pay a trapper to remove a cat. Trapping jaguars is illegal but not strictly enforced in Mexico.\n\nRecipients must agree to stop any hunting of deer or javelina on their land so the cats will have sufficient prey and won’t need to stalk cattle.\n\nRichar Vasquez has seen the results, both in his pocket and on the land.\n\nThe slender, middle-aged cowboy runs nearly 300 cattle for a ranch owner in the mountains east of Sahuaripa and has another 180 on his own place about two hours down the winding dirt roads. Both ranches protect cats and their prey, causing a notable surge in deer numbers, he said.\n\nIt means jaguars are less of a threat to people’s livelihoods, he said.\n\n“What are you going to do with them anyway?” he said. He has no intention of staying up nights to shoot or trap jaguars when they’re active.\n\nRisks and rewards\n\nYoung’s crew in March was digging a latrine pit when he stopped by to check on the ranch where Vasquez works. The cowboy offered instant coffee from a kettle on his fire and sat on a plastic chair under the half-enclosed, palm-thatched palapa where he cooks and sleeps.\n\nHe praised the jaguar program that has rewarded him monthly for seven years.\n\nA jaguar recently killed one of his horses, crushing the back of its skull and likely costing him 15,000 pesos to replace, he acknowledged. But the cameras on his property had netted him nearly that much — 14,500 — last December alone.\n\nThat was an exceptional month, with eight mountain lions, four bobcats and three ocelots, but he said the cats pay something every month, year-round. It helps him buy animal feed during dry months.\n\nSome other ranchers still despise jaguars, he said. They verbally “throw punches” at him because he cooperates with the conservationists. If anyone loses a calf to one of the predators, he said, “In their eyes, I killed the cow.”\n\nVasquez accepts as a neighbor the elusive spotted cat, which he has never actually seen in his 43 years of life in these mountains. He has affixed a smoke-tinged picture of one on a mesquite post supporting his shelter.\n\n“That animal is just like the rest of us,” he said. “When it is hungry, it has to find food.”\n\nLessons learned\n\nBiologists who worry about splitting and isolating animals have been here before.\n\nA border security buildup after the 2001 terrorist attacks threatened to cut off numerous species who carried their bloodlines north and south through the ages, preventing the Southwest’s black bears, pronghorns, big cats and others from becoming inbred or dying out locally.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP:Every mile of U.S.-Mexico border\n\nAnimals with a narrower range of genes are less able to adapt to change and more likely to go extinct.\n\n“In reality,” University of Arizona biologist Melanie Culver said, “our worries were never realized.”\n\nThat’s because the hundreds of miles of barriers built during the ensuing Bush and Obama administrations weren’t really impervious to big mammals. Impassable fences sprang up at urban or high-traffic crossings. Elsewhere, the government let mountains and desert provide natural barriers or built vehicle blockades that animals could easily squeeze through or leap over.\n\nA solid wall of 30 feet or higher, as the current administration has sometimes suggested, would end migrations.\n\nNone of the species Culver studies — including jaguars, mountain lions, ocelots and bears — have a “natural break” in their populations at the border, she said. All have individuals who traverse the border and could become stranded in one mountain range or another.\n\n“Now we may have cause to be worried again,” Culver said. “An impervious barrier is not what you want to have.”\n\nA wild frontier\n\nThe Northern Jaguar Reserve needs no gate or toll booth to separate people from its coatis and cactuses.\n\nThe mountain drive from Sahuaripa to its base camp covers less than 50 miles but takes six hours in a 4-wheel-drive pickup.\n\nOn his first trip up, Young had eagerly watched for all the “eagles” that residents back in town had told him lined the road. They were teasing him: The only eagles, and practically the only signs of human life, were the stylized birds on roadside cans of Tecate Light beer.\n\nHe visits for weeks at a time, sometimes alone and sometimes with a crew. When not repairing his truck or delivering supplies to cowboys, he might stack rocks into erosion-stopping road gabions or fix fences through which cattle have wandered onto the reserve.\n\nHe’s a caretaker with time to wander and learn the land, where it’s recovering from years of overgrazing when it was a ranch, and where it might need help with native grass seed. The ultimate plan is to buy land to grow the reserve and reinvent the healthiest possible environment for the dozens of jaguars roaming the region.\n\nThis part of Sonora gets around 20 inches of rain a year, making it more than twice as wet as Phoenix but not radically wetter than Patagonia or other Arizona mountain areas where cameras periodically detect male jaguars.\n\nA ridge of organ pipe cactuses ascends from camp and intersects with a line of paloverde and ocotillo trees. Short palm trees and yuccas line a creek dribbling past the cabins, and in spring the hills explode with yellow brittlebrush.\n\nCoatis scamper down trees and up rock cliffs when startled. Gray hawks screech. The reserve is a slice of nature fit for a national park, which the program is petitioning Mexico to create. That wouldn’t mean the same sort of public access as it would in the U.S, but a layer of protection from future mining claims underlying the private land.\n\n“I don’t see this as for tourists,” Young said. “This is for the jaguar.”\n\nAmong arid landscapes, this is as good as it gets for el tigre.\n\nMoving in the shadows\n\nAside from abundant prey, jaguars need water they can access every day. The mountains have it, in streams that flow seasonally and maintain watering holes in dry months. It also borders the Rio Aros — big water in solitude.\n\nNow, with a dozen ranchers accepting camera payments for the cause, the jaguars have an expanding safe zone.\n\nHere and in Arizona, biologists say, jaguars prefer to move under cover of vegetation. It often means following either an oak-lined ridge top or a shaded canyon. At the reserve, one particular dry wash deep in an orange canyon and shaded by palms and big mesquites has proven the most productive spot for trail cameras.\n\nThere, project staffers have opened the cameras to find video of a jaguar couple, sometimes strolling up the wash, sometimes mating. The vegetation is not so much thick as it is a continuous strand of limbs overhead, filtering dappled light that melds with a jaguar’s spots to conceal it.\n\nIt’s the same effect that oaks and pinyons have farther north in the Patagonia and Santa Rita Mountains, two Arizona ranges that have delivered jaguars from Mexico almost to Tucson’s doorstep in this decade.\n\nWhen a jaguar lurked in the Santa Rita Mountains for three years earlier this decade, almost nobody saw it in person. Numerous trail-cam snapshots confirmed its movements, but among the tens of thousands of days that hunters chased the deer and Montezuma quail there, only one person reported laying eyes on it.\n\nThriving in the Southwest?\n\nNo one knows how many jaguars could ever live in Arizona or the border region.\n\nThe federal draft jaguar plan takes a stab at it by listing biologists’ modeling of the borderlands habitat potential: 42, with six of those on the U.S. side, a figure based on observed cat densities in Sonora.\n\nSkeptics used that estimate to blast the federal proposal for spending millions of dollars and undermining national security for a half-dozen cats.\n\nPatagonia resident, attorney and consultant Dennis Parker in March submitted comments on behalf of southern Arizona cattle interests and counties calling the plan “unlawful, scientifically baseless, irresponsible, outrageously wasteful of taxpayer dollars, and insidiously threatening to both the future of the Endangered Species Act and national and citizen security.”\n\nSEE ALSO:Roaming Arizona jaguar is a male after all\n\nParker argues the plan is legally flawed in part because it treats a handful of U.S. jaguars as “essential” and relies on an international nongovernmental agency — the International Union for Conservation of Nature — to approve any downgrade in U.S. protections based on jaguar populations throughout their range.\n\nThere’s nothing illegal about consulting the IUCN, said Steve Spangle, field supervisor for U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s Arizona Ecological Services Office. The Endangered Species Act requires use of the best available science, and the organization is “highly regarded in scientific circles.”\n\nHe added that his agency initially declined to designate critical jaguar zones in the U.S. until a judge sided with conservationists who sued to require it. Jaguars continue to arrive and stay in Arizona, he said, because they have found something of value in the U.S. portion of the range.\n\nArizona officials still doubt the importance of their state to the species.\n\n“We’re at the very fringe of historical range, and then, even in the absence of any type of effective barrier to movement, we’re not seeing a lot of movement across the border,” said Jim deVos, the Game and Fish Department’s assistant director for wildlife manager. “A single male every couple years doesn’t make a population.”\n\nOn the jaguar's trail\n\nQuigley, the Panthera cat conservationist, and his colleague Alan Rabinowitz, a leading expert and lifelong student of jaguars, were saddling up for a March mule ride through the Santa Ritas, a range pointing north from the Patagonias toward Tucson.\n\nThey had followed a jaguar to Arizona, a male called El Jefe, who repeatedly triggered trail cams in the Santa Rita over three years — long enough that Tucson school kids gave him the name, meaning “the boss.”\n\nIt hadn’t tripped a camera in a year, but its long foray into what the two biologists considered hostile territory for a water-loving species fascinated them. To a jaguar, Quigley said, Arizona’s sparse woods must look the way Alaska does to most Americans: livable, but not for everyone.\n\n“This isn’t jaguar habitat, to me,” Quigley said.\n\n“This looks harsh,” Rabinowitz later agreed. He more often studies jaguars in lusher climates such as Central America or Brazil’s Pantanal, where they make a show of their unfeline affinity for water by swimming after abundant prey.\n\nThe Southwest’s oak woodlands are suitably remote and preserved, he said, but drier and sparser than most of the species’ haunts.\n\nJaguars started out around the Caspian Sea before moving to the Americas, and they evolved through shifting climates and a mass extinction that killed 80 percent of large mammals during the Pleistocene.\n\n“They’re unbelievably resilient animals,” Rabinowitz said.\n\n“They’re survivors,” Quigley said, “as El Jefe showed us.”\n\nEl Jefe went off radar in the fall of 2015 — possibly dead, or to another range, or back to Mexico — but the cat researchers used his former haunts as a launching point for a multi-year awareness campaign that will take them to various points along the “jaguar trail” from Arizona to Argentina.\n\nWithout a wall, Quigley said, jaguars would recolonize the U.S., as long as Mexico can nurture and expand the Sonoran population of hundreds.\n\nRabinowitz bristles at the political backlash he sometimes attracts from fellow conservationists for not focusing on Arizona jaguars or calling the proposed wall a life-or-death prospect for the species. He said he thinks the habitat and chances are better south of the border, and so that’s where conservationists should focus.\n\nEven if a breeding population establishes itself in the U.S., he said, its long-term survival would depend on its connections to a healthy Mexican core.\n\n“I’ve spent most of my professional life trying to save jaguars,” said the author of best-selling non-fiction about the species and children’s book called “A Boy and a Jaguar.”\n\n“I would love to see jaguars in the United States.”\n\nThe border wall would end that possibility, he agreed, but for species conservation, that means little next to the poaching that occurs in Latin America.\n\n“To me,” he said, “this (wall debate) is a fight about Americans wanting an American jaguar.”\n\nA true nature encounter\n\nThe riders passed yuccas and spindly ocotillos rising through a canyon where El Jefe had regularly roamed and tripped cameras. They rose past old prospector pits and the piled tailings of an abandoned mine, topping out on a ridge shaded by oaks and pinyons.\n\nJack Childs, a former mountain lion hunter, rode along with them. At one point the group spooked a group of deer that bounded over a ridge — cat food the old hunter said is abundant in the area.\n\nEl Jefe tripped many cameras in these mountains, from desert lowlands to snowy peaks. He seemed to favor small cliff bands near the mountaintops, from which he could spring down on deer, Childs said.\n\n“It’s a testimony to the habitat,” he said. “He made a good living here for three years.”\n\nChilds traded his gun for cameras after he and his wife treed a male jaguar in 1996, an awe-inspiring run-in with a rare cat he would eventually name Macho B.\n\nThe massive male had a bulging stomach from a recent meal, and it lay on a limb calmly as if waiting for the nuisance dogs to move on. It gave Childs time to film and soak it in. “We just figured we had been blessed with a true nature encounter,” he recalled.\n\nThe jaguar his dogs treed went on to live more than a decade in Arizona — sometimes crossing the border past his trail cams, Childs said — before a researcher who said he was acting at the state’s request bungled a capture attempt. Macho B, then the only known jaguar in America, had to be euthanized.\n\nBut Childs remained engaged in jaguar tracking and was part of a team that installed and checked cameras tracking El Jefe in recent years for Culver’s team at the University of Arizona.\n\nChilds, now 75, is a retired land surveyor and not a biologist. He admits he doesn’t know the technical definition of a resident species or critical habitat.\n\nTo him, though, the jaguars keep proving they can make a living in Arizona and that they belong.\n\n“If they live here for five years and they have fairly defined home ranges,\" he said, \"I call them a resident animal.\"\n\nChilds’s work has helped document seven jaguar border crossings. If El Jefe doesn’t come again, some other jaguar might. They should have the option, he said.\n\n“If this is the kind of habitat they can colonize, they will colonize it,” he said. “I just think they should be allowed to live here if they choose to do so.”\n\nPainful losses, then help\n\nYoung sped on the bumpy drive back from the reserve to the civilization of Sahuaripa, occasionally noticing his truck’s careen near a cliff edge.\n\nHe was heading home from the wild side of his job to focus on the people part: building relationships in town and working with a visiting scientist who was flying in to help assess the jaguar range’s health.\n\nAfter stopping for tacos that evening, he headed for a rancher’s Sahuaripa home to talk about his experience in the program and buy some Bacanora, the smoky agave moonshine that many locals ferment, for colleagues he would visit in Hermosillo.\n\nThe 72-year-old rancher, Rogelio Armando Aguayo, said in his lifetime here he had seen two jaguars, both crossing a road. But jaguars killed three large calves he owned.\n\n“It hurt a lot,” he said.\n\nIn years past, he wanted to strike them from the land, he said. Now he sees them as part of his environment and sometimes helpful, when they scare away coyotes and mountain lions.\n\nNorth of the border, the predator itself isn’t what scares ranchers. It’s the bureaucratic impediments that emanate from the Endangered Species Act.\n\n“It means much of my land — my private land — is now subject to the zoning requirements of the federal government,” said Chilton, the Arivaca rancher.\n\nThe idea of a wall is “devastating,” Young said. It cuts off the flow of jaguars just when Arizonans were beginning to celebrate their return.\n\nTHE WALL NEWSLETTER:Sign up to receive a free weekly email roundup of news about the border, immigration and the proposed border wall.\n\nJust like the Tucson school kids who named El Jefe when cameras caught him prowling the Santa Ritas, Yaqui students from Hiaki High School south of Tucson named the latest interloper Yo’oko, or “Jaguar Warrior,” and studied his role in their heritage.\n\n“So many people have gotten so happy and so passionate,” Young said. “It really redefined wildness to have (jaguars) there.”\n\nFor Young, extending the wall along all of the wild frontier would mean blocking Southwestern life in the same way that Northwestern reservoirs have blocked endangered salmon.\n\n“You’re basically building the longest dam ever built,” he said.\n\nIt would limit the options for the jaguars he’s protecting in the Sierra.\n\nAnd it might block an adventurous female from a date in Arizona.\n\nREAD THE REST OF THE SERIES:\n\nOcelots try to survive as habitat disappears\n\n\n\nEnvironmental coverage on azcentral.com and in The Arizona Republic is supported by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.

His grandmother used it. So did his parents and his friends.\n\nBlunt (yes, that's his real last name) started selling to friends in the neighborhood when he was 16. He was usually careful, buying in bulk from a trusted supplier and selling to customers who'd call him to meet up.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of illegal sales, it was $80 worth of pot that got him in trouble. He was found with a handful of baggies stashed in his pants when police officers came for him, tipped off by someone Blunt thought was a friend.\n\n\"We were out there trying to make money to help support our families at a time when people didn't have a lot money. We didn't think we were hurting anyone,\" said Blunt, now 39. \"I liked weed. I knew people who liked weed. Why not facilitate them getting good weed? That's how I looked at it.\"\n\nHis arrest in 2004 and his conviction left Blunt with a 10-year felony probation, allowing police to stop and search him anytime, for any reason. Meanwhile, all around Oakland, young black men like him were getting arrested while most of the white guys who were selling weed were left alone.\n\n\"It affected everybody in my circle because it was only targeted to us. I knew white people that was selling weed that never went to jail,\" Blunt said. \"The war on drugs was just about putting as many of us in jail as possible. It tore up a lot of families.\"\n\nThe war on drugs has for decades disproportionately devastated minority communities by punishing people like Blunt and creating a cycle of poverty, incarceration and limited employment options, legal and social justice experts say.\n\nNow, lawmakers and legalization advocates across the country are demanding not just cannabis legalization but remedies to address decades of demonstrably racist policing, from laws that automatically expunge criminal records for marijuana dealing and possession to policies that would give minority communities assistance in building cannabis businesses.\n\nThe same year as Blunt's arrest, Oakland's voters ordered police officers to make marijuana enforcement their lowest priority, below even jaywalking. But a decade later, the problem was laid bare: Officers were still arresting black men for marijuana crimes at rates staggeringly higher than for whites.\n\nAccording to the city's own statistics, 77 percent of the marijuana arrests in Oakland in 2015 were of African-Americans. Whites represented just 4 percent of those arrests, even though the city’s population is about 30 percent white and 30 percent black.\n\nSimilar data have been reported throughout the U.S. While marijuana legalization has reduced the overall number of marijuana arrests, people of color are still being targeted by police.\n\nEven in states with largely white populations, black people using or selling marijuana still face high arrest rates.\n\nIn Colorado, which in 2012 became the first state to legalize marijuana, the total number of marijuana arrests decreased by 52 percent between 2012 and 2017, from 12,709 to 6,153, according to state statistics. But at the same time, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans – 233 per 100,000 – was nearly double that of whites in 2017, and that's in a state that's 84 percent white.\n\nIn Alaska, of the 17 marijuana arrests in 2016, 29 percent were of African-Americans, even though they represent just 4 percent of the state’s population, making Alaska’s marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans nearly 10 times higher than that of whites. The state made recreational marijuana legal in 2014.\n\nAnd in Washington, D.C., where marijuana is legal, a black person is 11 times more likely than a white person to be arrested for public consumption of marijuana, according to Metropolitan Police Department statistics.\n\nHealth statistics show that whites and African-Americans use marijuana at roughly equivalent rates, which means the disparity in arrests is driven not by use but by police.\n\nYears of 'discriminatory enforcement'\n\nCalifornia has taken the lead in trying to amend years of racist drug policies.\n\nIn 2016, the state approved legal recreational marijuana in a ballot measure that also allowed people with pot arrests to get their records expunged. So few people took advantage of the opportunity, however, that state lawmakers passed a new law last fall ordering prosecutors to automatically review and potentially reduce or dismiss sentences and records for low-level marijuana offenses. It's the first statewide law of its kind.\n\nThough such efforts have the potential to make a difference, advocates say, it would have been better to include, from the very start, automatic expungement and other provisions to aid minority communities.\n\n\"Once the train has left the station, it's hard to attach new boxcars,\" said Christine De La Rosa, who owns marijuana businesses in California and Oregon and is lobbying to pass legal recreational pot in New York state. \"People are starting to understand and to put the pieces together: This child's father has been in jail for 16 years on a minor possession charge, and then right across the street at the marijuana convention you have a bunch of white guys in ties getting rich.\"\n\nSimilar debates over social justice reform and marijuana laws are unfolding in cities and states with legal marijuana and those without it. In Seattle, prosecutors have sought to abolish hundreds of convictions against people arrested with small amounts of pot. In New Jersey and New York, lawmakers are looking to legalize pot and expunge marijuana records once they do.\n\nIn Baltimore, State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby argues that police and prosecutor resources are better spent focusing on the city's extraordinarily high murder rate than on marijuana cases. Last month, Mosby announced that her office would no longer prosecute any marijuana possession cases, regardless of amount or prior criminal record, unless there was demonstrated intent to distribute. And she announced her office would vacate about 5,000 marijuana-related convictions dating back to 2011.\n\nMaryland decriminalized possession in 2014, but police still can and do issue citations. In a white paper released by her office, Mosby said that of the 431 marijuana citations issued by Baltimore police in 2017, 95 percent of them went to African-Americans, even though the city is roughly 60 percent black and 30 percent white. And of those citations, more than 40 percent were issued in one majority-black neighborhood.\n\nDrug laws have been \"disproportionately enforced in communities of color, and that's creating an erosion of public trust,\" Mosby told USA TODAY. \"We're moving toward legalization, and it makes absolutely no sense as the top prosecutor to be complicit in that discriminatory enforcement.\"\n\nAs a prosecutor, Mosby said, she's all too aware of how a criminal record can hurt someone for decades, even generations. In Baltimore, even though simple marijuana possession is a civil infraction, someone caught with a little bit of cannabis but without an ID can be arrested and booked, which turns the civil case into a criminal one.\n\n\"When you think about those collateral consequences, it's got impacts on housing, employment, adoption, mobility, property rights,\" Mosby said. \"It's a greater realization that these failed policies did not work and we need to take a different approach.\"\n\nWho gets to sell legal marijuana\n\nKevin Sabet, CEO of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said states should decriminalize marijuana and provide drug treatment rather than punishing users.\n\nThat could help lots of Americans targeted by the war on drugs. But he doubts it will help people who have been shut out of the legal weed industry because of their records. His group argues that the licensing systems created to sell marijuana are primarily benefiting companies racing to become the next Big Tobacco.\n\n\"The pot industry is largely rich, white, male, and despite lip service by some legalization advocates, this won’t change anytime soon,\" he said. \"The pot industry requires major institutional capital, and unless a state is handing out seven-figure checks to certain populations, license preference programs won’t make a dent.\"\n\nTo understand how this situation occurred, you first have to understand not just the laws governing marijuana legalization, but the regulations implementing the stores and licenses.\n\nIn general, the first states that legalized recreational marijuana made it hard for anyone with a criminal record to enter the marijuana business and gave preference to people already operating medical marijuana businesses, which were in many cases subject to even tougher licensing laws because those stores came first, when regulators were at their wariest.\n\nAnd because small-business loans are usually reserved for people without drug convictions, an arrest for simple possession also shut many would-be entrepreneurs out of now-legal cannabis business opportunities.\n\nThe end result? Tech workers, real estate investors and guys who owned construction companies have been the market leaders for years now, joined increasingly by white politicians like former House Speaker John Boehner, who backed the war on drugs and then, after leaving office, joined the board of a cannabis company in April 2018.\n\nA first-of-its kind survey by Marijuana Business Daily in 2017 found that whites made up 81 percent of people who had either started a marijuana company or had an ownership stake. New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, cited those statistics at a hearing this month, suggesting that most marijuana legalization systems were actually compounding the racial wealth gap.\n\n“It all comes down to money in the bank, time and community support,” said Adam Powers, who with his twin brother, Andrew, has worked in dispensaries and as cannabis consultants in Washington state. The Powers brothers, who are African-American, say they frequently deal with marijuana store owners looking to launch stores the pair compare to a Starbucks experience: non-threatening, consistent and accessible. And bland.\n\n\"From a logical standpoint, I can agree with it,\" Powers said. \"You make the industry super-hard to get into, that only people who are squeaky clean can get into it, because you know all eyes are on you. However, that is the approach always, always, that you take to whitewash things and make it clean. That's literally what you say before you fire the black people and the minorities.\"\n\nPowers, 31, said social justice was a clear motivating factor for many voters who supported legalization in Washington; they just didn't realize that legalizing pot sales wouldn't immediately right decades of wrongs.\n\n\"My life as a minority is a little bit easier knowing, hoping, that's one less reason for someone to bug me over something I use medically or recreationally, like alcohol,\" he said.\n\nFears of being targeted by police – especially federal law enforcement – kept many African-Americans without arrest records from immediately joining the semi-legal cannabis industry in its early days. For them, waiting to see how things shook out just made sense.\n\nActor and pot entrepreneur Whoopi Goldberg took a different approach. A longtime advocate for both racial equality and marijuana legalization, Goldberg, 63, co-founded a medical marijuana company in 2016, counting on her celebrity and age to insulate her from the unfair policing faced by young black men, she said.\n\n“When you look at who is in jail for marijuana, it kind of explains it all,” she said. “Black folks with marijuana went to jail a lot more than white folks with marijuana. I think it’s always been guy-oriented, and in particular white guys, because they could get away with it.”\n\nHelping drug dealers go legal\n\nFor many marijuana legalization activists, it's now up to local governments to diversify the legal pot industry by clearing conviction records and handing out subsidies. If white men have unfairly benefited from marijuana legalization, then it's only fair that minority communities be given extra help now because they suffered more, the thinking goes.\n\n\"We actually do have to overcorrect,\" said Kassandra Frederique, 32, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which is lobbying to legalize marijuana in the Empire State. \"People from our communities, black and brown communities, were the one first ones to be criminalized. Why shouldn’t we be the first ones to benefit?\"\n\nIn California, several cities have created cannabis equity programs to help former drug dealers go legal. The programs include business development, loan assistance and mentor relationships. In September 2018, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation to partially fund such programs. The bill stated it would help ensure \"that persons most harmed by cannabis criminalization and poverty be offered assistance to enter the multibillion-dollar industry as entrepreneurs or as employees with high-quality, well-paying jobs.”\n\nIn Massachusetts, regulators have also launched an equity program after acknowledging that while the state's population is 22 percent Latino or African-American, that same demographic makes up 75 percent of people imprisoned under mandatory minimums for drug crimes. The Bay State's equity program is specifically reserved for residents with a drug conviction or those who are married to someone with a drug conviction.\n\nYears after he was arrested, Blunt is now the first Oakland resident to benefit from the city's special license preference program. Under the equity program, longtime Oakland residents who were hurt by the war on drugs are getting priority, preference and special assistance to open up marijuana stores so they can sell cannabis legally. Blunt, who got his criminal record cleared once he finished his sentence, actually had to get it temporarily reopened so equity program managers could verify his arrest.\n\nBlunt tried to break into the industry on his own a few years back but couldn't crack into California's majority-white cannabis club scene. The equity program helped him launch his marijuana store, Blunts+Moore, in November. He sees the national push for more equity programs as a key component to easing the damage caused by the war on drugs.\n\n\"We're not just budtenders, not just security guards anymore. We're owners now,\" he said. \"To be able to sell this legally in my city, literally 10 blocks from where I caught my case, I'm fine – I wasn't going to let anything stop me. I'm the new kid on the block, and I'm here to change the game.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/03/20/council-removes-city-manager-following-worries-over-police-beating/443411002/", "title": "Asheville council removes Gary Jackson after police beating concerns", "text": "ASHEVILLE – City Council on Tuesday announced the dismissal of City Manager Gary Jackson as council members continued to grapple with community outrage over the police beating of a man accused of jaywalking.\n\nThe unanimous decision amounts to the biggest fallout to date after video of the beating became public.\n\nJackson's dismissal was effective Tuesday.

I wish the very best for everyone,\" Jackson said.\n\nCity residents and council members have expressed anger and disappointment after the leaking of police body camera video showing an officer beating a man police said had been jaywalking after he crossed a deserted street at night.\n\nCouncil members – and Jackson – said they had not known of the Aug. 24 beating before the Citizen Times published the video on its website Feb. 28.\n\nAfter an Aug. 25 complaint, Police Chief Tammy Hooper said she immediately told Assistant City Attorney John Maddux and not long after that Jade Dundas, who was interim assistant city manager at the time. But by law, the video could only be viewed by police and beating victim Johnnie Rush.\n\nThe attack drew furious community criticism, inflaming already tense relationships with minority communities. Rush is black. The officer who repeatedly struck him in the head while he was pinned to the ground is white.\n\nThat officer, Chris Hickman, resigned Jan. 5. It was the same day Hooper said she had planned to fire him. He has since been charged with two counts of assault, including felony strangulation.\n\nMore:Revisiting the Asheville police beating: Should Johnnie Rush have run?\n\nMore:Boyle: Asheville dropped the ball, big-time, in Rush beating case\n\nSharon Smith with Black Lives Matter was one of those calling for Jackson to leave after news of the beating.\n\n“Black Lives Matter is pretty much fed up with people making excuses for the blatant anti-black racism practices in this city. We demand it stop immediately, beginning with the city officials who have obviously abused their authority,” Smith said March 13, the first regular council meeting after publication of the video.\n\nKim Roney, who called for Jackson’s dismissal during her unsuccessful campaign for council last year, said city residents and elected officials “have the capacity and the will to be better” and welcomed Jackson's departure.\n\nThe city needs someone in the job “to move us towards creative, courageous change,” she said. “It’s not what we’ve had in a city manager.\"\n\nJackson was not without supporters despite the controversy.\n\n“Managing city operations in Asheville is like herding sheep, cats and driverless Ubers in the same pack,\" said Carl Mumpower, who was on the council at the time it hired Jackson and is now chairman of the Buncombe County Republican Party.\n\n\"That Mr. Jackson was able to successfully do so for so long under such a unique parade of elected officials is testimony to his competence and skills,” he said.\n\nThe head of a local police advocacy group said the firing raised questions about the reasons behind it.\n\n“I don’t know that much about what happened to Mr. Jackson,\" said Fraternal Order of Police President Rondell Lance \"I’ve known Mr. Jackson for years. He’s always been open and receptive for us to come talk to him about police issues.\n\n\"For them to all the sudden say, well, you’re gone, that is surprising. I don’t know if it’s just council trying to appease the cries from the community or whether there’s something legit. I don’t know but it causes you to kind of go, what is going on here?\"\n\nManheimer had lauded Jackson when his retirement was announced, saying he \"has served Asheville faithfully and effectively. ... He has served with dignity and integrity. The city of Asheville owes Gary a huge debt of gratitude for his leadership and effectiveness throughout his tenure.\"\n\nAssistant City Manager Cathy Ball will serve as interim city manager until a new one is found, according to the city.\n\nThe city said transition planning for a new city manager will be led by Vice Mayor Gwen Wisler, who will work pro bono.\n\nWisler said the city will stay on the same timeline for replacing Jackson it had settled on when his retirement was announced. That would mean it will be several more months before council hires a new city manager.\n\nJackson’s removal follows substantial changes announced Friday among some of the city’s most important officials.\n\nThose included the removal of Dundas as interim assistant manager and his transfer back to capital project manager. Taking over as interim assistant city manager was Peggy Rowe, who heads human resources.\n\nThe police chief, who had before reported to an assistant city manager, would now report directly to the city manager.\n\nAlso, the council would create a new office of equity and inclusion, expanding that from a one-person position and mandating that it report directly to the city manager.\n\nMore:Commissioners tell Asheville council to take action on police issues\n\nMore:Ex-officer appears in court after arrest in police beating incident\n\nThe announcement about Jackson on Tuesday was made at the same meeting where council members voted unanimously to pursue historic overhauls of city policing.\n\nThat could mean empowering a citizen body to review all use of force occurrences, pushing lawmakers to legalize the viewing of body camera footage by employees in the new equity department and funding an outside legal position to advocate for people filing complaints against law enforcement.\n\nIt could also mean starting an “aggressive” plan to hire minority officers, something that has been a stated goal of the department for decades. By January, 8 percent of officers were African-American, while the overall black population was 12 percent, according to census data and numbers provided by police to the Citizen Times .\n\nThe council's vote to replace Jackson came amid confusion over whether they had followed proper procedure.\n\nWhen the public portion of the work session ended Tuesday, Citizen Times reporters asked Manheimer about a state law that says, “Final action making an appointment or discharge or removal by a public body ... shall be taken in an open meeting” and handed her a copy of the statute with that passage underlined.\n\nCouncil then went into a previously planned closed session. Manheimer had first said council would not take any action following the closed session, but council returned to open session a few moments later to say it would after all.\n\nSeveral minutes later council returned to open session to remove Jackson.\n\nCouncil members also talked about aspects of Jackson’s contract and why he would be paid his salary and regular benefits for six more months.\n\nManheimer and Kapoor said Jackson’s contract mandated the payments unless he was given six month’s notice or unless he had engaged in criminal activity.\n\nHalf a year’s pay for Jackson would equal $97,607, according to information from his personnel file.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/08/18/michael-brown-ferguson-race-trayvon-martin-dewayne-wickham/14241205/", "title": "Wickham: Will Ferguson cops change?", "text": "DeWayne Wickham\n\nUSATODAY\n\nThe early morning call came from a man who is deeply entrenched on the front line of this nation's most enduring civil rights battle.\n\n\"This is by far the worst case I've encountered,\" attorney Benjamin Crump said of the police killing of Michael Brown, a black teenager shot dead by a Ferguson, Mo., cop after being stopped for jaywalking. Crump made the cellphone call to me last week shortly before Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a nighttime curfew in the St. Louis suburb, in an attempt to stop the disturbances that have erupted there in the wake of Brown's death. He later sent in the National Guard as nighttime violence spiraled out of control.\n\nCrump, the Brown family's attorney, said the way the black 18-year-old was killed on Aug. 9 is even more chilling than the killing of Trayvon Martin, the black Florida teenager whose 2012 death became a worldwide cause célèbre. Brown's death has turned Ferguson into a place of daytime protest marches and nighttime confrontations between the town's mostly black residents and its overwhelmingly white police force. It also has made Ferguson the nation's latest epicenter of racial conflict.\n\n\"Trayvon Martin was shot once. He was murdered at night by a wannabe cop,\" Crump said. \"Brown was shot multiple times in the middle of a street, in broad daylight, as he held his hands in the air in the universal symbol of surrender.\"\n\nPolice offer a different explanation for Brown's death. They say Darren Wilson, a white, six-year police veteran, shot Brown in self-defense. But, Crump said, \"Several witnesses are telling federal investigators amazingly consistent stories of how Brown was shot as he held his hands in the air.\" So far, the U.S. Department of Justice has only said that the FBI has \"conducted several interviews of witnesses on the scene at the time of the shooting.\"\n\nUncovering the truth of what happened to Brown won't be easy. But the damage done by the handling of this situation by those who are supposed to enforce the law will be infinitely harder to undo.\n\nFerguson's police chief, Thomas Jackson, seems more intent on absolving Wilson of blame than discovering what actually caused him to take Brown's life. Without even the pretense of a full investigation, Jackson announced that Brown attacked Wilson, pushing him back into his patrol car and struck him in the face during a struggle for his gun.\n\nHow the police chief was able to speak with such certainty about what provoked Wilson to shoot Brown several times, but unable to answer the charge that his officer gunned down Brown as he held his hands in the air to surrender, suggests that Jackson is in the wrong job. He ought to be the town's Fraternal Order of Police president, not its top cop.\n\nThis became even more apparent when Jackson — after days of delay — finally identified Wilson as Brown's killer. At the same time, the police chief released a surveillance video that allegedly shows Brown stealing some cigars from a neighborhood store minutes before his deadly encounter with the cop.\n\nUnless summary execution is the penalty for such a petty crime in Ferguson, the only relevance this video could serve would be to make Brown a less sympathetic victim for the prosecutor or grand jury that likely will decide whether the officer will be charged with a crime. An autopsy done at the request of Brown's family by Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, concluded that the teenager was shot at least six times.\n\n\"What could (Brown) possibly have done to be executed like that?\" Crump asked, as he ended our call without waiting for an answer.\n\nFor me, the more troubling question is: When the national spotlight dims in Ferguson, what kind of police force will it be left with — and will Thomas Jackson still be the town's top cop?\n\nDeWayne Wickham, dean of Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication, writes on Tuesdays for USA TODAY.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including ourBoard of Contributors.To read more columns like this, go to the opinion front page or follow us on twitter @USATopinion or Facebook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/05/08/pedestrian-deaths-up-sharply-between-2009-16/589491002/", "title": "Pedestrian deaths up 46% between 2009-16", "text": "Eric D. Lawrence, Chris Woodyard, Zlati Meyer, Kristi Tanner\n\nDetroit Free Press and USA TODAY\n\nPedestrian fatalities in the U.S. have skyrocketed 46% since 2009, creating an emerging public health crisis as researchers grasp to understand the reasons.\n\nThe increases far outpace growth in overall traffic deaths, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nAlmost 6,000 pedestrians — people who might have been out for a walk after dinner, hurrying to get to work or rushing to cross a street — were killed by motor vehicles on or along America’s roads in 2016, the latest year for which numbers are available. That's almost twice the number of deaths tied directly to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Put another way, more Americans are dying each year as they walk than have died in combat in Iraq since 2003.\n\nThe question for policy makers and others is what explains the dramatic increase.\n\nMore Money:From Toys R Us to Pilates studios: Malls fill empty stores with latest fitness fads\n\nMore Money:Americans more likely to buy electric cars, AAA study finds\n\nMore Money:Frontier Airlines adds two new cities as part of 9-route expansion\n\nAre phones, pot causing more pedestrian deaths?\n\nDistraction behind the wheel, texting while walking and even marijuana legalization have all been tagged as potential culprits in past research.\n\nIn addition, a new study released Tuesday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows an 81% increase in single-vehicle pedestrian fatalities involving SUVs between 2009 and 2016, based on federal records.\n\nAt a time when SUVs have overtaken passenger cars in new vehicle sales and automakers are shifting their production plans — Ford, for instance, recently announced it was dropping most of its passenger car lines in the U.S. — the implications for America’s most vulnerable road users, pedestrians, could be stark.\n\nDavid Harkey, Insurance Institute president, said one reason SUVs have an outsized impact on pedestrian fatalities has to do with their design.\n\n“SUVs have higher front ends, and often the design for the vehicle is much more vertical than passenger cars,” Harkey said. “We do think that the number of SUVs on the roadways now and the size of the vehicles is playing some role.”\n\nThe institute, best known for its video-recorded crash tests using dummies inside vehicles, has not performed such tests with pedestrian dummies to examine the impact of SUVs versus passenger cars.\n\nReached for comment, a spokesman for a top auto industry advocacy group said that he was unaware of specific research on SUVs and pedestrian fatalities, but that huge strides are being made in accident prevention.\n\n“Safety continues to be a priority for automakers,” said Wade Newton of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, “and companies are working to advance pedestrian-sensing automatic emergency braking — with some versions already on the market.”\n\nWhatever the combination of reasons, pedestrian fatalities reached 5,987 in 2016, their highest level since George H.W. Bush — the first President Bush — was in the White House.\n\nThe USA Today Network is investigating the phenomenon of rising pedestrian fatalities, an urban problem primarily plaguing either cities with high poverty rates or warm-weather spots such as Florida and Arizona. Our analysis so far has found that African Americans are killed at a disproportionate rate compared with their population nationwide.\n\nNationally, more pedestrians die in collisions when they are jaywalking along busy arterial roads. More of those fatalities also occur at night and involve males. Many of these crashes also involve alcohol, though federal safety researchers say that does not explain the increase. In 2016, pedestrians accounted for 16% of traffic deaths; in 2007, that figure was just 11%, according to NHTSA.\n\nThe varying factors at play highlight a problem with many components and many unanswered questions.\n\n“There’s a lot of unknowns in this space right now,” said Jana Lynott, a senior strategic policy adviser with the AARP Public Policy Institute.\n\nUrban troubles\n\nThe crisis is felt most keenly in America’s cities, and its effects are nationwide. The highest rankings in 2010-16 among cities with more than 200,000 people were not just older industrial centers such as St. Louis and Newark but also in Sun Belt cities such as Phoenix, Baton Rouge, La., and Miami.\n\nIn Detroit, which had the highest rate among larger cities, nearly a quarter of the 118 people who died in traffic crashes in 2016 were pedestrians. Despite its troubling ranking, the city in 2016 saw improvement in its fatality numbers, which dropped after 65,000 streetlights were installed over a three-year period.\n\nThe dramatically increasing rate of pedestrian fatalities has caught the attention of city planners, safety agencies and researchers seeking to drill down on why more people are dying as they walk. They are developing strategies, including suggestions for improving pedestrian infrastructure and slowing driver speeds, for cutting those numbers substantially.\n\nNHTSA has begun a major examination into the effect of electronic device usage on pedestrian deaths. That process could help clarify the role that distraction, particularly connected to cell phone use, plays in pedestrian fatalities. NHTSA said no studies show “a direct link between the behavioral effects of distraction and pedestrian crash risk,” but the agency says distraction-affected motor vehicle crashes lead to many deaths and injuries.\n\nThe Governors Highway Safety Association earlier this year suggested that marijuana legalization could be one reason for the rise, noting that the seven states and Washington, D.C., where recreational use of pot was legalized between 2012 and 2016 had a 16.4% increase in pedestrian fatalities for the first half of last year, while other states saw a decline. That suggested link has drawn skepticism from some who call it hard to prove. The study also noted the increase in cell phone usage, with the number of smartphones in active use in the U.S. increasing by 236% from 2010 to 2016.\n\nSome cities have responded to the carnage by taking action.\n\nNew York targets drivers\n\nIn 2017, 101 pedestrians were killed in New York City, the lowest number since the city began keeping that statistic in 1910. The number has dropped 45% since Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was elected in 2014, implemented a strategy called Vision Zero, a multi-agency effort that uses engineering, education and enforcement. Compare that with the 184 pedestrian deaths in 2013.\n\n“We are proud of the fact that here in New York, we are, at the moment, bucking the disheartening national trend,” said Polly Trottenberg, commissioner of the city’s Department of Transportation.\n\nUnderpinning all that is lots of data, she explained. The city identified where the accidents were happening — about 10% of streets or intersections are responsible for 50% of them — and began redesigning the roadways, using methods including installing plastic lane bollards to prevent drivers from making sudden, sharp left turns and tweaking walk/don’t walk signs to change before the traffic lights do to give pedestrians several extra seconds of crossing time.\n\nOfficials lowered the city’s default speed limit from 30 m.p.h. to 25 and increased the number of school zones outfitted with cameras from 20 to 140. One oft-cited success is Queens Boulevard, a 12-lane road in the eponymous borough, which had been nicknamed the Boulevard of Death for the 185 deaths there, 138 of them pedestrians, since 1990. In 2015 and 2016, the number was zero.\n\nProfessional drivers, such as cabbies, truckers and city bus drivers, underwent special training, and a public-safety campaign worked to explain to civilian drivers that the choices they make behind the wheel are critical. There is no similar education effort for pedestrians.\n\n“We focus our education efforts on folks who are driving 4-ton vehicles,” Trottenberg said. “They’re the ones who are in control of life or death.”\n\nBut making these Vision Zero changes doesn’t come cheaply, so other municipalities that wish to emulate New York’s success didn’t just happen in a New York minute.\n\nThe city has spent more than $700 million since 2014 and has $1.6 billion allocated to use through the summer of 2022, according to the New York City DOT.\n\nThe New York Police Department has also taken action.\n\nThe department agreed to change traffic-enforcement officers’ shifts after DOT accident data showed a huge spike in serious injuries and fatalities later in the day when Daylight Saving Time ends in the fall. Officers also wrote many more tickets for behaviors known for causing accidents, such as speeding, failing to yield to a pedestrian, using a cell phone while driving and texting while driving — close to 685,000 in 2017, up from 7.3% in 2016 and 20.2% in 2014.\n\nAnn Arbor effort\n\nIn Ann Arbor, a campaign is under way.\n\nIn a video being aired on local TV, an elderly man waves to a stopped driver as he crosses the street.\n\n“If your dad was crossing, you’d stop,” a female narrator says before viewers are reminded they would do the same thing for a favorite aunt, their high school biology teacher, even someone wearing a chicken suit because they love chickens.\n\nThe videos are part of Ann Arbor’s effort to educate drivers on the requirement to stop, not just yield, for pedestrians in crosswalks in the city that is home to the University of Michigan.\n\nThe video launched last week as an ad on TV stations with a message that will reach not only viewers in Ann Arbor, but also in nearby Detroit.\n\nAnn Arbor’s crosswalk ordinance requires drivers to stop for a pedestrian if the pedestrian is still on the curb and has not yet stepped into the crosswalk. That approach has prompted grousing from some residents who believe it encourages bad behavior on the part of pedestrians, even though the ordinance also prohibits pedestrians from stepping in front of a vehicle that has no time to yield.\n\nThe city also has a growing network of midblock crossings — 137 as of last year and 35 with enhanced warning devices, such as flashing lights, according to a city report. Driving along some of the city’s busier residential streets dotted with crosswalks, it’s easy to see why some residents think that many more of those crossings should have warning lights. The city has paired the infrastructure expansion with ticketing of drivers, which officials credit with doubling the stoppage percentage in some cases.\n\nRobert Kellar, a city spokesman, said Ann Arbor has no jaywalking ordinance, and he does not appear ready to recommend one.\n\n“When pedestrians can cause the driver of a vehicle to be killed,” that might be the time for a jaywalking ordinance, Kellar said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the focus is on making streets safer.\n\n\"If we can design our streets to protect our most vulnerable users, we can create a better environment for everybody,\" said Nat Gale, program manager for Los Angeles' Vision Zero program, noting the high number of pedestrian fatalities. \"What we find is our walkers are overrepresented. They represent 15% of traffic collisions, but half of deaths.\"\n\nAfter identifying the corridors that have the highest number of deaths, the team went about finding solutions.\n\nSome intersections, for instance, were given \"walk\" signals that activate before the main traffic light turns green. That way, drivers see pedestrians in their field of vision.\n\nCrosswalks are being made more visible. Some, for instance, get bold white stripes to make them more visible to drivers, like the Beatles on the cover of their Abbey Road album. Pavement markers help, too.\n\nThe city also has more \"scramble crosswalks,\" where intersections are closed to cars entirely so pedestrians can cross however they'd like, including diagonally. One is at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, the intersection next to the theater where the Academy Awards are held.\n\nDistracted pedestrians\n\nSome cities are passing laws against walking and texting when crossing streets.\n\nHonolulu, which had seven pedestrian deaths in 2016, is one of them.\n\n\"The hope is more municipalities will adopt similar language looking at pedestrians and vehicles,\" said Council member Brandon Elefante, who led the effort to the pass the law.\n\nHe said he got the idea after visiting a local high school where a \"youth for safety\" club had formed.\n\n\"They invited us to come and look at their campaign to educate their peers, who were basically texting in a crosswalk,\" Elefante said. They thought a law was needed.\n\nThe law passed 7-2 on the council. There was opposition from some people who thought it was government overreach. At first, the fines were going to be high, up to $500 for a violation.\n\n\"We lowered it to $99\" for those who violate the law three times in a year. Now, the minimum for the first violation is a minimum of $15 and maximum of $35 for a first violation, then at least $35 and not more than $75 for the second. The third is between $75 and $99.\n\nThe law, however, has been in a warning phase. Since it was enacted, there have been 88 violations. But they have been decreasing, so much so that by March, only 14 were written, Elefante said. Under the law, you can hold a cell phone, you just can't use it in a crosswalk.\n\n\"It's actually millennials who advocated and conceived a law,\" he said. \"They are concerned about their peers. Now it is a law.\n\n\"The story and law have really taken off.\"\n\nAnother city that has adopted a similar law is Montclair, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb of about 40,000.\n\n\"We're in our warning phase, our education phase,\" said Jon Hamilton, director of administrative services and human resources. \"We have been putting up signage around the city, engaging with our local schools so we can get our message out to them.\"\n\nFrom January to April 16, however, police had issued 30 warnings. As in Honolulu, the numbers have been decreasing as the word gets out. The youngest violator was 13 and the oldest 51.\n\n\"The feedback we have gotten has been overwhelmingly positive,\" Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the law was prompted by an accident in which a woman was injured. \"We want to make this a pedestrian-friendly city.\"\n\nContact Eric D.

And it was cold. The windows were busted. Two scruffy wool blankets covered a three-inch plastic mattress. He had to use both blankets – one to cover his feet, the other for his upper torso. But it was so cold Senghor eventually got up and put one of the blankets in the broken window. As he looked out, he saw two cats playing around a garbage can. He envied their freedom.\n\nRE-ENTRY:Is America failing its prisoners?\n\n“It just was ... dark and lonely sitting in that cell and realizing that this was the next however many years of my life, if not the rest of my life,” says Senghor, author of Writing My Wrongs: Life, Death and Redemption in an American Prison.\n\nSenghor, who was sentenced to 17 to 40 years for second-degree murder, served 19 years in prison, spending seven years in solitary confinement. He was released from prison on June 22, 2010. He walked in at the age of 19, and didn't walk out until he was 38.\n\nSenghor is now 45, and the past seven years have been a mixed bag. It was hard to find a job. For a couple of years, he said, his job applications were dismissed almost immediately because of his felony conviction.\n\nAs difficult as starting over was for Senghor, he had it better than others. He lived in Michigan, a state with one of the lowest employment restrictions for former felons in the country — 94. The state with the highest number, Louisiana, has 389 employment restrictions. Nationwide 6,392 of the 48,000 restrictions on former felons are on employment.\n\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\n\nAccording to a 2015 study by the Center for American Progress, state laws bar people with certain convictions from more than 800 occupations nationwide. It found that more than 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals remain unemployed a year after being released.\n\nAnd men who have been incarcerated earn an average of 40% less than those who have never been incarcerated, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe inability to work and support loved ones is a particularly difficult reality for men whose identity is often wrapped up in how well they can provide for their families.\n\n“We have all these barriers in place,\" says Glenn E. Martin of finding employment. He founded JustLeadershipUSA, an organization dedicated to cutting incarceration in half by 2030. \"Then you have this ... narrative about if you're not able to achieve those things then you're not a real man.”\n\nMartin served six years in prison for robbery. He says the criminal justice system is about punishment and punitiveness, not rehabilitation or correction, transformation or second chances. Our system knocks people down a few notches at sentencing, he says, but has no way of bringing them back up.\n\nMore than half of men are rearrested within five years of being released from prison.\n\nBeyond employment challenges, strict rules regarding parole and probation make successful re-entry challenging for men, says Senghor. Any encounter with police, he notes, can get an inmate sent back to prison. As an African American man returning to a low-income neighborhood, it’s difficult to avoid law enforcement, Senghor points out. Something as small as jaywalking can get black men detained in communities where stop-and-frisk measures are disproportionately employed.\n\nAnd Senghor remembers growing up in such a community in Detroit. At 17 he was shot while standing on a street corner. And he developed a paranoia that turned into hyper-violence, he explained during a TED talk.\n\nThat defensive posture — is what caused him to pick up a gun, and what eventually led to his arrest and incarceration.\n\nIt took a long time for Senghor to drop that way of thinking. And some men never do as they rack up more serious criminal infractions and technical violations while they are on parole.\n\n“We should be figuring out ways…to do away with a lot of these technical parole violations which aren't crimes,\" Senghor says, \"but you're punishing the person as if they've committed a new crime and you're creating the stigma that anybody who's going back just can't get it together when in reality a technical violation really isn't something worthy of a person being incarcerated for.”\n\nSenghor is working on that issue as the director of strategy and innovation for #cut50, an organization co-founded by Van Jones that works on criminal justice reform policies including re-entry initiatives and reducing the restrictive nature of probation and parole. He is also a consulting producer for the show “Released,” on the OWN network. It shows the challenges of people recently released from prison.\n\nSenghor describes America’s justice system as “dysfunctional, broken, outdated, and not designed to foster rehabilitation efforts or to keep communities safe.” He says systemic racism, a failed mental health system, poverty, drug addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder contributes to mass incarceration more than anything else.\n\n“We have a system that fails,\" Senghor says. \"And we still dump money into the system to further support the things that are proven not to work.”\n\nLottie Joiner is a 2017 John Jay/Harry Frank Guggenheim Crime Reporting Fellow and a Fund for Investigative Journalism/Schuster Institute Social Justice Investigative Reporting Fellow.\n\nVisit Policing the USA or the Re-entry project for more podcasts, videos and columns and interviews with male, female and juvenile inmates across America in coming installments of this series.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/06/ladybug-storm-riot-going-sweaty-sparty-news-around-states/39552525/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The Russian protest band Pussy Riot is planning a July 11 concert in Birmingham to benefit Planned Parenthood after the state passed the nation’s toughest anti-abortion law.

It asks the city to immediately start cleaning up camps and disposing of waste, the Anchorage Daily News reports. City officials say the letter fails to offer realistic solutions to a complex issue and did not acknowledge work already occurring.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona farmers will soon begin planting commercial hemp under a 2018 state law that just took effect. The state law allowing industrial hemp farming and processing was to take effect in August after state agriculture officials set up a licensing and certification program. But state lawmakers moved it up after the federal farm bill passed in December and legalized industrial hemp nationwide. Brian McGrew runs the program for the department and said it expects to begin issuing licenses this week.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court has revived part of Monsanto Co.’s lawsuit stemming from the state’s ban of an herbicide that farmers said had drifted onto their crops and caused widespread damage. The court reversed a Pulaski County judge’s decision to dismiss parts of the company’s lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Plant Board’s composition and a requirement that pesticide registrants must submit research conducted by University of Arkansas researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A huge blob that appeared on the National Weather Service’s radar wasn’t a rain cloud, but a swarm of ladybugs over Southern California. Meteorologist Joe Dandrea says the array of bugs appeared to be about 80 miles wide as it flew over San Diego on Tuesday. But Dandrea tells the Los Angeles Times that the ladybugs are actually spread throughout the sky.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A grand jury says a central Colorado sheriff’s department wrongly billed inmates more than $16,000 to cover the costs of jailing them. But the grand jury’s report says members did not have enough evidence to indict former Lake County sheriff Rodney Fenske or jail supervisors. Prosecutors say all the involved officials have left the sheriff’s office. The new sheriff, Amy Reyes, closed the jail this year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanbury: A battery-powered glider crashed into the roof of a Danbury home, injuring the pilot and scaring a woman and her two children who were watching TV. Neighbors described hearing a small explosion when the aircraft ran out of power and became partially embedded in the attic.

Dyke March will return to the streets of the capital Friday after a 12-year hiatus. The Washington Post reports the gay rights march, first held in 1993, is billed as a more radical and inclusive protest ahead of Saturday’s Pride celebration. March organizers say the event’s return was prompted by the erosion of LGBTQ community services, legal protections and establishments. This year’s theme is displacement.\n\nFlorida\n\nPinellas Park: A man faces a misdemeanor domestic battery charge after police say he poured ketchup on his girlfriend of 11 years as she slept. According to an arrest report, Heather King told investigators she woke up in the middle of the night to find Peter Wagman pouring ketchup on her and cursing at her after a quarrel. Wagman was ordered to have no contact with King.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Emory University received its largest one-time research grant with a $180 million gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund research and analyses on high child mortality rates in impoverished communities.

The bridge has been closed since May 8.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers have agreed to prohibit the creation of most new freestanding emergency rooms in a bid to protect the state’s fragile rural hospitals. Sen. Fred Mills, a St. Martin Parish Republican, says stand-alone emergency departments drain profitable services from rural hospitals that operate on narrow margins.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Two Maine brothers whose canoes capsized on remote Umsaskis Lake say fast-thinking Boy Scouts from New Hampshire helped save their lives. Michael Fiori, 67, of Brunswick, said he was shivering after more than an hour in the 50-degree water when the Scouts, who were camping nearby, found him on the shoreline and warmed him with heated stones wrapped in towels. The Scouts contacted a ranger who found Larry Fiori, 70, of Kennebunk. He was in the water about three hours and was found clinging to a floating gas tank and his shredded life jacket. He was hospitalized with hypothermia. “If it wasn’t for the Scouts, I don’t think either one of us would have survived,” Michael Fiori said Wednesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nCannon: A Maryland appeals court says a known Baltimore gang member must reimburse a family he scared away when he threatened to blow up their house.

An administrative judge is scheduled to hear DiMasi’s appeal next week.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: Michigan State University says its Sparty mascot will no longer participate in most parades due to concerns about heat stroke or other health issues for those wearing the costume. School spokeswoman Emily Guerrant says the policy is expected to be reevaluated later this year. She says there have been no near-death experiences for students who have worn the Sparty suit at parades, but there were concerns some “pushed themselves too hard” in hot weather.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors have charged a Minneapolis man with carelessly disposing of embers from a hookah and accidentally causing the fire that destroyed a historic pavilion on a city lake. Nouh Elmi, 23, is charged by summons with negligent fires, a felony. The complaint says Elmi dumped hot coals from the water-cooled tobacco pipe behind garbage cans at the building on Bde Maka Ska, also known as Lake Calhoun. The May 16 fire destroyed the pavilion’s Lola on the Lake restaurant concession. The building was later razed.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Supreme Court has changed the rules to say a person seeking to become a lawyer who fails the bar exam three times must return to law school for at least 12 semester hours before retaking it. The passage rate has dropped from 79% in 2014 to 48% last year. The order will take effect with the February 2020 bar exam. Some justices disagreed, arguing instead for a three-failure limit. Justice Josiah Coleman wrote that the court had no data on whether candidates who fail three times would be competent to practice law after 12 additional hours of law school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: An animal rescue has named a litter of puppies born during an outbreak of severe weather after Kansas City TV meteorologists. Midwest Animal ResQ of Raytown says the puppies were born May 24, when tornado warnings were issued. One day earlier, storms injured about two dozen people in Jefferson City and killed three others elsewhere in the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge says Montana’s secretary of state does not have the authority to unilaterally override Gov. Steve Bullock’s veto of a bison bill. District Judge Mike McMahon on Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction blocking Secretary of State Corey Stapleton from beginning the process of publishing the vetoed bill in state law. The dispute threatens the efforts of a conservation group that is acquiring land to try to create the nation’s largest private wildlife reserve, which could one day be home to 10,000 bison.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Homeowners with major flood damage to their property may be able to get a tax break using a state Department of Revenue form.

Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a brief news conference Sunday, Bolsonaro said the voting reflected the poor economic conditions felt by poorer Brazilians, and promised to appeal to voters who are worried about rising prices.\n\n“We have a second round ahead where everything becomes the same, the (television advertising) time for each side becomes the same. And now we are going to show it better for the Brazilian population, especially the most affected class, the consequence of the ‘stay at home, we’ll see the economy later’ policy,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nBolsonaro, who has routinely discredited the Brazilian electoral system and threatened to not accept its results, managed to beat Lula in the southeast states, the most populous of the country.\n\nMore than 123 million Brazilians waited in long lines to vote in the world’s fourth largest democracy, while another 32 million abstained. According to TSE President Alexandre de Moraes, the extensive queues were caused by new biometric security checks and higher than expected voter turnout.\n\nSeveral other presidential candidates were in the running but trailed far behind the two frontrunners.\n\nSimone Tebet of the Brazilian Democratic Movement came third with 4.1% of valid votes, and Ciro Gomes of the Democratic Labour Party received 3.05% of the vote.\n\nGomes said in a news conference Sunday that he is “deeply concerned” about Brazil’s political polarization. “I have never seen a situation so complex, so challenging, so potentially threatening to our fortunes as a nation,” he said.\n\nAfter voting alongside his wife, Rosangela da Silva, at a Sao Paulo school on Sunday, Lula told reporters: “We don’t want more discord, we want a country that lives in peace. This is the most important election. I am really happy.”\n\nHe also referenced the 2018 elections, where he had been unable to run – or vote – because of a corruption conviction that was overturned last year.\n\n“Four years ago I couldn’t vote because I had been the victim of a lie in this country. And four years later, I’m here, voting with the recognition of my total freedom and with the possibility of being president of the republic of this country again, to try to make this country return to normality,” Lula said.\n\nSupporters of Brazilian former President Luiz Inácio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they watch the vote count of the legislative and presidential election, in Sao Paulo, Brazil on October 2.

Bruno Kelly/Reuters Prev Next\n\nLula vs. Bolsonaro on the campaign trail\n\nWhile there were nearly a dozen candidates on the ballot, the race was dominated from the outset by Lula and Bolsonaro, two titans of Brazilian politics who engaged in a bruising campaign season marked by bitter verbal attacks and a series of violent incidents between rival supporters.\n\nBolsonaro, 67, ran for re-election under the conservative Liberal Party. He has campaigned to increase mining, privatize public companies and generate more sustainable energy to bring down energy prices. He has vowed to continue paying a R$600 (about $110) monthly benefit known as Auxilio Brasil.\n\nHis government is known for its support for ruthless exploitation of land in the Amazon, leading to record deforestation figures. Environmentalists are warning that the future of the rainforest could be at stake in this election.\n\nBolsonaro has also been widely criticized for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 686,000 people in Brazil have died from the virus.\n\nLula, 76, focused his campaign on getting Bolsonaro out of office and highlighted his past achievements throughout his campaign.\n\nHe left office with a 90% approval rating in 2011, and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through the “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\nHis campaign promised a new tax regime that will allow for higher public spending. He has vowed to end hunger in the country, which has returned during the Bolsonaro government. Lula also promises to work to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nLula, however, is also no stranger to controversy. He was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\nFollowers of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva react as they listen to the partial results after polls closed in Rio de Janeiro on October 2, 2022. Silvia Izquierdo/AP\n\n‘If they are clean elections, no problem’\n\nBolsonaro, who has been accused of firing up supporters with violent rhetoric, has sought to sow doubts about the result and said that the results should be considered suspicious if he doesn’t gain “at least 60%.”\n\nOn Saturday, he repeated claims that he expected to win in the first round of presidential elections “with a margin higher than 60%,” despite being 14 points behind in the most recent poll that day.\n\nBoth Bolsonaro and his Liberal Party have claimed that Brazil’s electronic ballot system is susceptible to fraud – an entirely unfounded allegation that has drawn comparisons to the false election claims of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThere have been no proven instances of voter fraud in the electronic ballot in Brazil.\n\nThe Supreme Electoral Court has also rejected claims of flaws in the system, as “false and untruthful, with no base in reality.”", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha Kara Fox Rodrigo Pedroso Caitlin Hu", "Camilo Rocha", "Kara Fox", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/10/europe/french-presidential-election-results-intl/index.html", "title": "French election: Emmanuel Macron to face Marine Le Pen in French ...", "text": "Paris (CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron will face Marine Le Pen in the second round of the country's presidential election, setting up a rematch of their runoff contest in 2017.\n\nCentrist Macron and Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, were the top two candidates in the first round of Sunday's vote, picking up 27.8% and 23.2% of the ballots respectively, according to the French Interior Ministry.\n\nTwelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24.\n\nThe first round of the 2022 contest was marked by voter apathy, with participation estimated at 73.3%, according to an analysis by pollster Ifop-Fiducial for French broadcasters TF1 and LCI -- the lowest in a first round in 20 years.\n\nWhile Macron received more votes than any of the other candidates in the first round, he is a polarizing figure whose approval rating has sagged during his first term.\n\nIn a speech after polls closed on Sunday, he urged citizens to vote in the second round.\n\n\"Nothing is settled and the debate that we will have in the coming 15 days is decisive for our country and our Europe,\" he said. \"I don't want a France which, having left Europe, would have as its only allies the international populists and xenophobes. That is not us. I want a France faithful to humanism, to the spirit of enlightenment,\" he said.\n\nMacron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002. Polls have given him a consistent edge over the rest of the field, but the race has tightened significantly in the past month.\n\nPolling by Ifop-Fiducial released on Sunday showed that Macron would win a second-round contest against Le Pen by just 51% to 49%.\n\nLe Pen's support has steadily risen in recent weeks. Though she is best known for her far-right policies such as drastically restricting immigration and banning Muslim headscarves in public places, she has run a more mainstream campaign this time around, softening her language and focusing more on pocketbook issues like the rising cost of living, a top concern for the French electorate.\n\nMarine Le Pen addresses her supporters on Sunday after the first round of the French presidential election.\n\nIn her speech Sunday, Le Pen vowed to be a president for \"all the French\" if she wins the second round, and called on those who didn't vote for Macron to support her in the second round.\n\nLeftist firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon came third, with 22% of the vote. He enjoyed a late surge in support and was considered a possible dark horse candidate to challenge Macron.\n\nWho Melenchon's voters choose to back in the second round could decide the presidency, experts say. Melenchon told his supporters that \"we must not give a single vote to Mrs. Le Pen,\" but did not explicitly back Macron.\n\nNo other candidate received more than 10% of the votes. Far-right political commentator turned presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to Ifop polling, came in fourth at 7.1%.\n\nThe other candidates on Sunday's ballot have quickly begun throwing their weight behind the top two. While Zemmour called on his backers to vote for Le Pen, the others urged their supporters to steer clear of her.\n\nThe candidates from the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, have already backed Macron.\n\nSocialist Anne Hidalgo said a Le Pen victory would instill in France \"a hatred of everyone set against everyone,\" while Republican Valerie Pecresse said she was sincerely worried for the country because \"the far right has never been so close to winning.\"\n\n\"The project of Marine Le Pen will open France to discord, impotence, and collapse,\" said Pecresse.\n\nA woman picks her ballots in the first round of the French presidential election in Lyon, central France, on Sunday.\n\nThe rematch\n\nMacron's political rise shattered the playing field, as his centrist political party has pulled supporters away from the traditional centrist parties, the Socialists and the Republicans. Both its candidates polled under 5% on Sunday.\n\nSurveys ahead of the race showed that a second round of Macron vs. Le Pen was the most likely outcome. Macron handily beat Le Pen five years ago, but experts have said that a second contest between the two would be much tighter than the 2017 race.\n\nMacron is no longer a political upstart and must run on a mixed record. While his ambitious plan to bolster the European Union's autonomy and geopolitical heft won him respect abroad and at home, he remains a divisive figure when it comes to domestic policies. His handling of the yellow vest movement , one of France's most prolonged protests in decades, was widely panned, and his record on the Covid-19 pandemic is inconclusive.\n\nMacron's signature policy during the crisis -- requiring people to show proof of vaccination to go about their lives as normal -- helped increase vaccination rates but fired up a vocal minority against his presidency.\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron (center), next to his wife Brigitte Macron (left), speaks to a resident before voting for the first round of the presidential election on Sunday.\n\nMacron has, so far, done very little campaigning. Experts believe his strategy was to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates. Polling showed him consistently leading all candidates, and he was considered a shoo-in to make the second round.\n\n\"The widespread dissatisfaction with Macron (especially among the young) means that the outcome is uncertain and unpredictable. Le Pen will continue to exploit this, and a major political upset therefore remains possible,\" said CNN European affairs commentator Dominic Thomas of the second round matchup.\n\n\"However much they may dislike Le Pen, there is a world of difference between her and Macron, and how she would disrupt European and global politics.\"\n\nLe Pen is the daughter of another famous far-right presidential candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The elder Le Pen made it to the runoff against Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Marine Le Pen has managed to perform better than her father in the first round of each of the past two presidential elections.\n\nLe Pen has tried to portray herself as a very different candidate to the one who lost to Macron in 2017 , when she attempted to position herself to the forgotten French working classes as her country's answer to then-US President Donald Trump. While her economic nationalist stance, views on immigration, euroskepticism and positions on Islam in France are unchanged, Le Pen has sought to broaden her appeal.\n\nThe contest was at first predicted to be a referendum on the dominance of the extreme right in French politics, but the war in Ukraine -- another key issue for voters -- upended the race.\n\nAccording to Ifop polling, Macron's support peaked in early March, as potential voters rallied around the flag and rewarded the president for his attempts to mediate the conflict in Ukraine before Russia's invasion, even if it was a failure.\n\nMany experts also expected the war to hurt the Le Pen, who had been a vocal admirer of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who has become a pariah in the West due to the Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine in late February. Le Pen visited the Russian president during her 2017 campaign; this time around, she was forced to scrap a leaflet with a photo of her and Putin from that trip after Russia's unprovoked attack on its neighbor.\n\nThomas, the CNN European affairs commentator, explained that the forthcoming debates will be crucial if Macron is to convince voters that Le Pen's previous support for Putin should disqualify her.\n\n\"He will be vulnerable on a range of domestic issues, but she will have difficulty convincing the electorate of her foreign policy credentials, especially given her longstanding links with Russia,\" he said.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger", "Joseph Ataman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/americas/brazil-elections-analysis-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Brazil election: With Bolsonaro and Lula facing off, anything could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrazilians head to the polls Sunday to select their next president in what has been one of the country’s most contested and polarizing elections in recent history.\n\nAlthough there are nearly a dozen candidates on the ballot – and several other seats up for grabs – the October 2 race is dominated by two frontrunners: right wing incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro and leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of the Workers’ Party.\n\nThe race is extremely heated. Bolsonaro and Lula, as he is popularly known, have used Twitter, YouTube, televised debates and massive political rallies to present their positions and attack each other at every turn. And violent rhetoric among their supporters has left many voters feeling fearful of what is yet to come.\n\nAccording to a Datafolha poll conducted in August, more than 67% of voters in Brazil are afraid of being “physically attacked” due to their political affiliations. And the country’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal has issued a ban on firearms within 100 meters (330 feet) of any polling station on election day.\n\nBoth candidates have been seen on the campaign trail flanked by security and police, even wearing bullet proof vests at times. Bolsonaro wore his as he kicked off his reelection bid last month in the city of Juiz de Fora, at the exact location where he was stabbed in the stomach during the 2018 presidential campaign. Lula was seen also wearing a vest during an event in Rio de Janeiro, the same city where a homemade stink bomb was launched into a large crowd of his supporters back in July.\n\nLula and Bolsonaro: Ideological opposites\n\nThe race pits two titans of contemporary Brazilian politics – and polar opposites – against each other.\n\n“These are two well-known figures, two of the largest and most unique populist leaders in Brazilian politics from the past 20 years,” Antonio Lavareda, director of Brazilian polling group Ipespe, told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.\n\n“For the first time, we have a president who is being evaluated based on his nearly four years in office and a former president who already has a consolidated image.”\n\nBolsonaro, 67, who is often referred to as the “Trump of the Tropics,” is running for reelection under the conservative Liberal Party. At the center of his campaign and his reelection plan is what he says is the right for freedom: freedom of expression, freedom to live and freedom to use the country’s natural resources for future development and growth, including in mining and other agricultural businesses. Bolsonaro’s job creation strategy is based on investing in industry to promote job growth, especially in tech. The former paratrooper also supports expanding access to gun ownership for self defense.\n\nBolsonaro’s record from his first term could be a liability. He was widely criticized in Brazil and abroad for his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, which killed more than 685,000 people, and for a spike in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon under his presidency, among other things.\n\nLula, 76, was president of Brazil for two consecutive terms from 2003 to 2011. On the campaign trail, he has mostly focused on getting Bolsonaro out of office and has leaned heavily on the achievements of his previous presidential terms. He left office with a 90% approval rating and is largely credited for lifting millions of Brazilians from extreme poverty through “Bolsa Familia” welfare program.\n\n“I don’t need to make any promises to you,” Lula said during a recent campaign stop in Sao Paulo. “My policies are endorsed by the legacy of my previous eight years in power, which were very successful for this country and all sectors of society.”\n\nLula was convicted for corruption and money laundering in 2017, on charges stemming from the wide-ranging “Operation Car Wash” investigation into the state-run oil company Petrobras. But after serving less than two years, a Supreme Court Justice annulled Lula’s conviction in March 2021, clearing the way for him to run for president for a sixth time.\n\n“I didn’t need to be president again. I could keep my title as the ‘best president in history’ and go live the last few years of my life in peace. But I saw this country destroyed. I saw education run by a guy who didn’t like education. So, I decided to go back,” Lula said in July, when he officially accepted his party’s nomination.\n\nSowing doubt about the vote\n\nSeveral polls show Lula in the lead. The latest poll, released on Thursday by respected research group Datafolha, showed him ahead of Bolsonaro by 14 points, just three days before the Sunday vote.\n\nAfter Datafolha ruled out blank and undecided voters, its model found Lula at 50% among valid voters, versus the 36% who said they would support Bolsonaro. This margin increased in the hypothetical scenario of a second round, showing Lula with 54% of the vote versus Bolsonaro’s 39%, according to Datafolha. Other national pollsters, such as Ipec and Ipespe, has increasingly undermined supporters’ faith in the vote itself.\n\nWithout presenting proof, Bolsonaro has claimed that the country’s electronic voting system could be rigged and even said it had been tampered with in the past. There is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996.\n\nHe has also cast doubt on his country’s election authorities. During his recent trip to London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral, Bolsonaro told Brazilian broadcaster SBT, “If we don’t win during the first round of voting, something abnormal happened within the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.”\n\nCritics have warned that such talk could lead to outbreaks of violence or even refusal to accept the election result among some Brazilians – pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot incited by then-US President Donald Trump after he lost the vote.\n\nThere have already been several reports of political discourse among Lula and Bolsonaro supporters turning violent, even deadly.\n\nOver the weekend, police registered two fatal incidents in states on opposite ends of the country. In the northeastern state of Ceara, a man was stabbed to death in a bar after identifying himself as a Lula supporter, according to police. And authorities in southern Santa Catarina state say a man wearing a Bolsonaro T-shirt was also fatally stabbed during a violent discussion with a man whom witnesses identified as a Workers’ Party supporter.\n\nPolice say they are investigating both incidents and that arrests have been made.\n\nThe hostility is attracting global concern. UN human rights experts issued a statement earlier this month urging Brazilian authorities, candidates and political parties to ensure a peaceful vote.\n\n“We are concerned that this hostile environment represents a threat to political participation and democracy and urge the State to protect candidates from any threats, acts of intimidation or attacks online and offline,” the experts said.\n\n“All those involved in the electoral process must commit themselves to peaceful conduct prior, during and after elections. Candidates and political parties must refrain from using offensive language which may lead to violence and human rights abuses.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback ¿Lula o Bolsonaro?

This could have a direct impact on whether people go to the polls,” Creomar de Souza, a political scientist and founder of Brasilia-based Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, told CNN Brasil.\n\n“We’re seeing cases and incidents of violence and other types of aggression and humiliation, which are making people feel scared.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they don’t know what they want. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the high-wattage personalities vying for Brazil’s presidency, there are fewer undecided Brazilians this year, De Souza pointed out.\n\n“If you look at the metrics in this election, we have the lowest number of undecided voters since Brazil’s return to democracy.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., will go toe-to-toe this fall for the House seat representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.\n\nFlowers has raised more than $8 million in his bid to unseat the polarizing Congresswoman, some of which came from out-of-state donors who just don’t like Greene. Flowers faced a small business owner, Hollie McCormack, and a former Rome city commissioner, Wendy Davis, in the district’s Democratic primary.\n\nHours before the Associated Press called the race in Flowers’ favor, he deemed himself the primary winner, writing on Twitter “on November 8th, I will unseat Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\n- Ella Lee, Associated Press\n\nIncumbent v. incumbent: Rep.

Brian Kemp in the general election.\n\n“I think she just needs to tell the truth about all the many ways that Brian Kemp has not served our state and our community,” said Ali.\n\nAli pointed to the Peach State’s high maternity mortality rates as one reason why Abrams will win in the gubernatorial election.\n\n“I think Brian Kemp's record speaks for itself. And Stacey Abrams ain’t gotta do nothing but point to it,” Ali said. “And Georgians will make their decision for what works best for them.”\n\n– Mabinty Quarshie\n\nParty crossing in the primary\n\nAVONDALE ESTATES, Ga. – With tight primary races on the Republican side, some Democrats outside Avondale Estates City Hall said they voted in the Republican primary.\n\nAnn Kruger, a psychology professor at Georgia State University, said she voted in the GOP contest to register her opposition to the former president.\n\n“I came to vote in the party that is not my affiliation to vote against Trump-endorsed candidates,” Kruger said.\n\nGeorgia is an open primary state, meaning that people can cast a ballot in either party’s nomination contest. Typically, Kruger said she votes for Democrats.\n\nFellow Georgia State University Professor Deirdre Oakley said she also considered voting in the Republican primary despite being a Democrat.

The former football star is running for Senate in Georgia as a Republican.\n\nWarnock was Georgia’s first Black Senator, and Walker is also Black. Though Georgia will have another African American Senator no matter which candidate wins, Warnock and Walker have vastly different views of what it means to be Black in America. While Warnock has been outspoken on racial issues, Walker has downplayed the effects of racism in America.\n\nThe contest between Walker and Warnock could be tight, with RealClearPolitics’ latest polling data between the pair placing Walker a half point ahead of incumbent Warnock. But claims of stalking and abuse by Walker’s past partners and other women could upend his bid for office in the coming months.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock renominated by Democrats\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock easily won his primary race in Georgia as he seeks to seize his first full term in office.\n\nThe Atlanta minister, who serves as pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, became the Peach State's first Black senator when he defeated Republican Kelly Loeffler in a special election runoff in 2021.\n\nWarnock is likely to face former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican, who has the support of former President Donald Trump and establishment GOP lawmakers.\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAbrams wins Democratic nomination for Georgia governor\n\nStacey Abrams will once again be the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor after sailing through the primary contest unopposed.\n\nAbrams lost the 2018 contest for governor against Republican Brian Kemp by less than 2% and refused to concede in the ensuing months, citing voter suppression.\n\nFour years later, Abrams has become a rising star in the Democratic Party nationally as a voice for voting rights. She has led massive registration drives that many have credited with making Georgia a battleground state.\n\nIn 2020, Abrams was rumored to be on the short list of President Joe Biden's potential running mates.\n\nShe was also heavily recruited to run for U.S. Senate but bypassed after citing her renewed passion to oppose election law changes being pushed in Republican-controlled state legislatures.\n\nIf elected in November, Abrams would be the Peach State’s first Black governor.\n\n– Phillip M.

So far, only Democrat Stacey Abrams’ primary bid for governor has been called in her favor. She will face either Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp or former Sen.

Henry Cuellar is up against Jessica Cisneros in the primary runoff in South Texas.\n\nCisneros has campaigned against Cuellar for his anti-abortion stance amid the Supreme Court draft opinion leak earlier this month indicating the court will overturn Roe v.

Cuellar is the only Democrat in the House who opposes abortion rights.\n\nSome leaders in the Democratic Party, including House Majority Whip James Clyburn and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are supporting Cuellar, to the ire of abortion supporters in the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statewide office, George P.

Wade.\n\nThe headline race is a Georgia rematch between Republican incumbent Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is struggling to gain traction this time around.\n\nSummer polls show Kemp’s popularity remains strong after beating a Trump-backed challenger, but the Abrams campaign received some good news this week after a Quinnipiac University survey found the race \"too close to call.\"\n\nKemp held 50% of likely voters compared to 48% for Abrams in a poll with a 2.7% margin of error.\n\nBesides the candidates, voters in multiple states have other choices to consider in the form of ballot initiatives dealing with major public policy questions.\n\nThere will be least five states — California, Michigan, Montana, Kentucky and Vermont — are asking voters to weigh-in on abortion.\n\nAnother five — Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota — will give people the chance to legalize marijuana for residents age 21 or older; and Colorado is giving voters the opportunity to allow the use of certain psychedelics.\n\nBelieve it or not, voters in five states are going to be asked whether slavery and/or involuntary servitude should be abolished too. The issue is part of a larger criminal justice reform movement aimed at prison labor.\n\nPolls show Biden's approval ratings inching up\n\nBiden's approval rating has improved following a series of legislative wins like the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the most significant gun control bill in decades, coupled with falling gas prices.\n\nA Siena College/New York Times poll this week found 42% of respondents approved of how Biden is doing his job as president, compared to 53% who disapproved.\n\nIn the same poll, respondents said they were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate than the Republican candidate in their district, 46%-44%. The poll surveyed 1,399 registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points.\n\nIn the most recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls, Democratic candidates led in two Senate battlegrounds.\n\nIn a poll of Ohio released Monday, GOP candidate J.D. Vance and Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan were virtually tied in the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman, with Ryan leading Vance 46.6%-45.6%.\n\nOhio poll:In key US Senate race, Democrat Tim Ryan leads Republican JD Vance by a point\n\nIn Nevada, incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces Republican Adam Laxalt in what is expected to be one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. An August survey conducted by Suffolk University and the Reno Gazette-Journal found Cortez Masto leading Laxalt, 45%-38%.\n\nNevada poll:Democrats' midterm prospects look better despite headwinds in Suffolk poll\n\nWhat are the key issues?\n\nThe Supreme Court’s landmark decision rolling back Roe cracked open one of the fiercest debates in U.S. history months before the election.\n\nNow Democrats are hoping that it will energize their base in swing districts and battleground states as dozens of anti-abortion laws are being triggered in multiple states.\n\nAbortion effect:Channeling abortion outrage, Democratic women push for upsets in Senate elections\n\nConservatives have argued the high court’s ruling tossed abortion back to the states where it belongs, but Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, introduced a bill that would prohibit abortion nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nProgressive-leaning candidates and activist say that is further evidence of the importance of keeping Democrats in power to codify reproductive rights.\n\nBut Republicans are banking on other concerns being at the forefront of voters' minds: namely a 40-year inflation high that has only slightly eased in the past year as wages remain flat.\n\nAugust’s inflation levels were up 8.3% from the year prior, according to the U.S. Labor Department.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll released this summer found one out of five voters said the economy in general was the top concern. Another 11% inflation cited inflation as the most important issue.\n\nRising prices:Are we stuck with blistering inflation? High prices leave experts wondering when we'll see relief\n\nConservative leaders also are hoping that they can make the fall elections about crime and immigration as well, which was been thrust to the forefront as Republicans governors have been sending planes carrying undocumented migrants to Democratic states.\n\nIn many ads, GOP candidates put a spotlight on a spike in crime rates for major U.S. cities and have tried to connect those increases to the 2020 protests against police brutality.\n\nDemocrats in some districts and states, such as Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke, however, have not shied away from focusing on violence.\n\nThe May 24 shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and the fight over a national gun control policy could be a decisive factor in several races.\n\nWhat could also define many of these races is what candidates have said about the last election. There are hundreds of Republican candidates, including some running to oversee election rules as secretaries of state, on the ballot this year who echo Trump's groundless claims of a stolen election in 2020.\n\nThe 2024 implications\n\nThe result of the midterms will set the table for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nIf Democrats suffer significant loses, it will intensify the party's debate about whether the 79-year-old Biden is fit to run for reelection.\n\nA USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll in late August found liberals want a unifier, but Democratic lawmakers, activists and voters are saying it might be time for new blood.\n\nDemocrats divided:'We need a change maker': Dems want more from Biden on abortion and climate\n\nOn the Republican side there is a different type of conversation, chiefly on what Trump will do and if the GOP should move past the controversial former president.\n\nThe same USA TODAY/Ipsos survey, for instance, showed GOP voters want a fighter who will battle for \"the freedom and dignity of all Americans.\"\n\nMany point to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is up for reelection this year, as the most likely heir apparent, which is why Democrats are salivating at the idea of defeating him this fall – a long-shot according to most analysts.\n\nAre midterm campaigns in the debate avoidance era?\n\nOne feature of the 2022 cycle is the increasing resistance of Democratic and Republican candidates to face their rivals on the debate stage.\n\nIt took weeks of back-and-forth negotiations for Georgia Senate candidates Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock to agree to one debate on Oct. 14.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Fetterman and Oz finally agreed to a single face-off on Oct. 25 after much strife and haggling.\n\nNorth Carolina Democratic Senate candidate Cheri Beasley and Republican Rep. Ted Budd also agreed to a sole debate on Oct. 7.\n\nDemocrat Katie Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, declined to debate Republican Kari Lake in their gubernatorial race.\n\nIn Ohio, Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance has not agreed to debate Democrat Tim Ryan, despite Ryan agreeing to three debates. And Nevada voters may not get one at all after Cortez Masto agreed to three debates but Laxalt has not made it clear if he will do any.\n\nUp for debate?:Midterm candidates dispute rules and dodge debates in a new campaign normal\n\nBut there are still important debates happening for voters to contrast the candidates.\n\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will debate Democrat Beto O’Rourke on Sept. 30. DeSantis and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist both agreed to debate on Oct. 12. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio debates Democratic Rep. Val Demings on Oct. 18 – in one of the most closely-watched Senate races this year.\n\nAnother competitive race to watch: Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican Blake Masters face off on Oct. 6\n\nWhen does early voting start?\n\nAmericans will get to cast their ballots as soon as next week in some places with early or in-person absentee voting options.\n\nThe first states to cast ballots this election cycle are Minnesota, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming, who allow early voting beginning Sept. 23.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Illinois and Michigan allow votes too.\n\nMost states allow early voting beginning in October:\n\nOct. 9: Maine\n\nOct. 10: California\n\nOct. 11: Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico\n\nOct. 12: Arizona, Indiana, Ohio\n\nOct. 17: Georgia\n\nOct. 19: Iowa, Kansas, Rhode Island, Tennessee\n\nOct. 20: North Carolina\n\nOct. 21: Washington\n\nOct. 22: Massachusetts, Nevada\n\nOct. 24: Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, Texas\n\nOct. 25: Hawaii, Missouri, Louisiana, Utah\n\nOct. 26: West Virginia\n\nOct. 27: Maryland\n\nOct. 28: Delaware\n\nOct. 29: Florida, New Jersey, New York\n\nOklahoma and Kentucky don’t allow for ballots to be cast early until Nov. 2 and 3, respectively. However, in Kentucky, excused early voters can cast ballots beginning Oct. 26.\n\nIn six states – Alaska, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin – early voting dates vary by county and location. And in four others – Alabama, Connecticut, Mississippi and New Hampshire – in-person early voting is not allowed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/california-special-election-devin-nunes-seat/index.html", "title": "California special election: Six candidates compete to replace Devin ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPolls have closed in California’s 22nd Congressional District where voters cast their ballots in the special election to replace Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who resigned in January to head the Trump Media & Technology Group.\n\nSix contenders were vying to fill the vacant seat in a district covering portions of Fresno and Tulare counties from Clovis to areas south of Visalia. But the winner may only end up serving in Congress for a few months after the district was sliced into pieces by the state’s non-partisan redistricting commission. It will cease to exist in its current form when the new Congress is sworn in next year.\n\nNunes’ loyalty to former President Donald Trump made him a polarizing figure in California and nationally. But the race to replace him among four Republicans and two Democrats – most of whom are not well-known – has been relatively congenial, focusing largely on local issues like drought and the struggle to get more water to farmers in the Central Valley.\n\nAs of Monday, less than 16% of the mail ballots that were sent to each voter eligible to vote in Fresno County – about 40,657 ballots – had been returned by the 258,752 voters who were eligible to participate. Less than 14% of the mail ballots sent to the 156,269 eligible voters in Tulare County had been returned as of Monday, according to county officials. All registered voters in the district were sent a mail-in ballot.\n\nTuesday’s election was the first step toward filling the district’s vacancy, under its current lines, through the end of the year. June’s California primary and November’s general election will be held under the new lines drawn by California’s redistricting commission, with the winner taking office in 2023 for a regular two-year term. Under the new maps, much of Nunes’ old district will become part of the new 21st District, anchored by Fresno, where veteran Democratic Rep. Jim Costa is the front-runner in what is considered a safe seat for his party.\n\nUnder California’s top-two primary system, county officials will determine whether any candidate has received the majority of the votes (50% plus 1). If not, the top-two finishers, regardless of party, will proceed to a runoff on June 7, when California holds its statewide primary election. A runoff could produce even more confusion, because the names of one or more of the special election candidates could appear twice on the June ballot if they’re competing for a second office.\n\nThe brevity of the potential assignment in Washington created a split among the candidates between those who say they’re only interested in this seat and those who are simultaneously seeking another congressional office for the term that begins in 2023.\n\nRepublican Connie Conway, who has the most name recognition in the field as a former minority leader in the state Assembly and a former Tulare County supervisor, argued voters should support her because she would serve in a “caretaker” role and not use the office as a “stepping stone” to another congressional office.\n\nFormer California State Assembly member Connie Conway, a Republican, has argued that she would be the most qualified \"caretaker\" for the remainder of former Rep. Devin Nunes' term. From Connie for Congress\n\n“There’s just a lot of district work that I really want to see happen until the very end; I think that’s very important,” Conway told CNN, noting the troubleshooting role congressional offices play on everything from passport delays to problems with Social Security benefits. Conway said she has built relationships with most members of the California delegation on both sides of the aisle. “I think I’m the right person at the right time to finish the job.”\n\nOthers like Republicans Matt Stoll and Michael Maher, as well as Democrat Eric Garcia, viewed the Nunes seat as a starting point as they vie to represent the new 21st District, where they will face Costa.\n\nStoll, a retired Navy fighter pilot who has said he wants to be a part of a “red tsunami” in November, told CNN he is trying to build momentum in the special election as “a springboard” for the contest in the 21st District. He described the remaining months of Nunes’ term as a time when he could build alliances with like-minded members “to roll back every aspect of the progressive agenda and what Joe Biden stands for.” He listed examples that ranged from school curriculum that he says is intended to “indoctrinate our children in socialist ways,” to environmental lawsuits in the Central Valley that have limited the flow of water for farmers, to limits on domestic oil drilling, which he says have thwarted America’s potential for “global energy dominance.”\n\nRetired Navy fighter pilot Matt Stoll hopes to be part of a \"red tsunami\" this year as he runs as a Republican for both the vacant seat in California's 22nd District and a seat in the new 21st District. Courtesy Matt Stoll campaign\n\nAt the other end of the ideological spectrum, Garcia argued that if Democrats can gain control of Nunes’ seat, it would serve as an important symbolic victory for the residents of the San Joaquin Valley, who have been “suffering in silence” from the region’s decades-long challenges with poverty, air pollution and contaminated water supplies. Garcia told CNN he would focus on just one piece of legislation to aid the Valley’s struggling families – reinstating the enhanced monthly child tax credit that ended in 2021 after Democrats’ efforts to extend it collapsed.\n\n“I don’t see (the special election) as a stepping stone. I see it as an opportunity to finally bring representation to a district that has been neglected for 10 years,” said Garcia, a therapist and Marine veteran who unsuccessfully challenged Nunes in 2020 and decided to run in the district again after the US Capitol insurrection.\n\n“Generations upon generations of my family live in this valley and we’re suffering with bad air, bad water. I’m just sick of it,” Garcia said. “I want to be a voice for those people who have no voice and have been left behind.”\n\nDemocrat Eric Garcia, a Marine veteran, said he decided to run again for the 22nd District after the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. From Facebook/Eric Garcia for Congress\n\nCommitment to immigration reform in an agricultural region\n\nThe sense that the region’s voters have been neglected was a unifying sentiment among the candidates, including Republican technology executive and former congressional aide Elizabeth Heng, who founded The New Internet, an encrypted internet browser that she said does not track or sell the information of its users.\n\nAs the daughter of Chinese-Cambodian immigrants who grew up in Fresno working in her parents’ grocery store, Heng told CNN she has been frustrated by what she called the lack of progress on top issues for the district’s voters. She pointed to the scarcity of water, the need for both immigration and education overhauls, and what she views as a hostile climate for those trying to start or maintain businesses. She noted that she ran to address those same concerns as the 2018 Republican nominee in the 16th Congressional District, which she lost to Costa by 15 points.\n\n“Even just the basic civil discourse here – it has completely deteriorated – and we need to have new faces, new leaders that can bridge the divide,” said Heng. She argued she could be a “leading voice” in “getting our immigration policy resolved once and for all” as the daughter of refugees who escaped the Khmer Rouge.\n\nAs the daughter of Chinese-Cambodian immigrants, Republican Elizabeth Heng said she could be a leading voice for an immigration overhaul. Courtesy Elizabeth Heng Campaign\n\n“We need to come up with new ideas to be compassionate about the individuals that are already in our country – and on top of that, DACA recipients that through no fault of their own are in the state. We need to have a pathway to citizenship for them,” she said, referring to immigrants who came to this country as children and were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that is now in limbo.\n\nAll of the Republican candidates supported Trump’s border wall.\n\nMaher, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, has said he hopes to foster a less polarizing conversation around immigration. He said he would work on legislation to “create a clear pathway for people to come in and work and be able to return home.” When asked whether he favors a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in this country, or even a narrower solution for the “Dreamers,” Maher wouldn’t commit to a specific plan.\n\n“This is not an issue that one congressman from the Central Valley is going to come and say, ‘I’m going to solve this entire thing,’” he said, adding that he is working with the Latino community in the Central Valley as well as business owners and farmers to determine the best solution based on the region’s labor needs.\n\nRepublican Michael Maher, a Navy veteran, said he would align himself with the consensus of the Central Valley rather than the views of one party. From Maher for Congress\n\nUnpredictability in a field of lesser-known candidates\n\nEven longtime political observers of the region were skittish about making predictions in an unusually timed special election among a field of lesser-known candidates and low spending.\n\nHeng led the field in fundraising, according to the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, after raising $214,900, followed by Garcia with $205,715.\n\nAs the Central Valley got more competitive during Nunes’ final terms, the veteran congressman enjoyed a comfortable lock on his district not only because of his rising national profile within the GOP as House Intelligence Committee chairman, but also his huge war chest. He held his seat with a comfortable 8-point margin in the 2020 – a slightly better showing than Trump, who defeated Biden by just over 5 points in the 22nd District. Nunes had poured more than $20 million into the race to dispatch Democrat Phil Arballo, who spent about a quarter of that amount and is now running in the new 13th District.\n\nIn the most recent breakdown of party registration available from the state, nearly 39% of voters in the current 22nd District were registered as Republicans, 34% as Democrats and 20% as “no party preference.”\n\nDuring a Fresno County Republican Party forum earlier this year, Conway, Maher and Stoll all pledged to support Trump if he were to run for president in 2024. Heng said she believes there are some “great” potential GOP contenders including Trump, but said she believes all of the candidates should “earn the support” of voters through the primary process.\n\nAll four GOP candidates said they would favor an audit of the 2020 presidential election during that recent forum, though Conway said her support would depend on what entity was conducting the audit. There is no evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, and even GOP-led partisan “audits” have confirmed Biden’s victory.\n\nDemocrat Lourin Hubbard has embraced policies like eliminating federal taxes on overtime, which he says would help lower- and middle-income families. Amanda Brazzell/Courtesy Lourin Hubbard Campaign\n\nThe Republican registration edge in the district hasn’t stopped the Democrats vying for Nunes’ seat – Garcia and Lourin Hubbard – from championing some progressive policies that go well beyond even what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed as a presidential candidate.\n\nHubbard told CNN he favors eliminating all federal taxes on overtime to help lower- and middle-income families. He supports canceling student loan debt, favors tuition-free community college, and would also like to see “debt-free public college” where the state and federal government defray the costs of four-year public universities. He also wants the federal government to guarantee every person in America a union job that pays at least $20 an hour. A manager at the state water resources control board, Hubbard said he is shaping a proposal that would ask the government to pay off existing medical debt of up to $25,000 or $50,000 for all Americans – noting it is one of the top reasons people go bankrupt – but said he had not yet calculated what that would cost.\n\nIn his pitch to voters who hesitated about supporting a Democrat, Hubbard asked them to consider whether “voting for the same party, the same person, over the last 20 years really made a difference or an impact in your everyday life.”\n\n“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,” he said. “So with this special election – and me not running for anything else – I’ve kind of been freed up to say: ‘Let’s just try something new.’”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/politics/primary-elections-ranked-choice-voting-what-matters/index.html", "title": "Ranked-choice voting, nonpartisan primaries and other efforts to ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nAmerican democracy is changing right now in important and optimistic ways in red and blue states.\n\nAnger at the lack of choices in the two-party system fueled the ranked-choice voting experiment in reliably Republican Alaska, which pairs with a similar experiment in the liberal haven of New York City. In ranked-choice voting, voters rank candidates in order of preference. Learn about the entire process.\n\nThere is ranked-choice voting in Maine. There are nonpartisan primaries in California and technically no primary at all in Louisiana.\n\nWhile political parties are consolidating their power with redistricting in states where they can – Texas and Illinois, for instance – voters, given the chance, often choose to take power away from the parties.\n\nI talked to Nick Troiano, executive director of the nonprofit Unite America Institute, one of a number of state and national groups pushing to overhaul American democracy by taking control of primaries away from political parties.\n\nOur conversation, conducted by phone and edited for flow, is below.\n\nWhat’s the problem with primaries and democracy?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: In a nutshell, what’s wrong with the primary system?\n\nTROIANO: I think the primary system is the biggest solvable problem fueling political polarization today. And that’s because:\n\nFirst, most of our elections are in safe districts that are effectively decided in primaries. Second, turnout in those primaries is very low. And third, those who do turn out aren’t very representative of the electorate as a whole.\n\nAnd so, therefore, candidates and elected officials are rewarded for pandering to their base and punished for reaching across the aisle to solve problems.\n\nWhy do nonpartisan primaries help?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Your group pushes nonpartisan primaries. Why do those solve the problem, if you’re still relying on a small subset of voters in a primary?\n\nTROIANO: Fundamentally, nonpartisan primaries make the general election the election of consequence, when most voters are turning out.\n\nIn a system of nonpartisan primaries, every voter gets to participate and cast a ballot that matters, not just those who belong to the majority party in a given state or district.\n\nIt gives a lot more power to voters, as well as better choices too.\n\nHow do we know these work?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Is there any hard evidence that these actually cut down on polarization?\n\nTROIANO: Yes, plenty.\n\nSeveral states have had nonpartisan primaries for a long time, including Louisiana, which doesn’t have primaries, essentially. California, Washington and Nebraska and now most recently, Alaska.\n\nAt least one study from USC found that new members of Congress elected under nonpartisan primaries are 18 percentage points less extreme than new members elected under partisan primaries.\n\nThe reality is that these reforms take some time not only to implement but to truly affect who runs for office and who gets elected. There is sometimes a delay in us seeing results from the moment of adaption. That’s why I think we’re still learning a lot.\n\nThere is still partisanship\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Let’s take the examples there – California and Washington are reliably blue states with mostly Democratic congressional delegations. Nebraska and Alaska are reliably red states with mostly or entirely Republican delegations. We still have the problem, or the reality, of two parties controlling things, right?\n\nTROIANO: Well, I think the Alaska system is an improvement over top two, because it not only advances four candidates to the general election, but it includes ranked-choice voting, which levels the playing field for independent and third-party candidates by eliminating that spoiler effect.\n\nSo I would expect to see more competition in the Alaska system versus states that have had other kinds of nonpartisan primaries.\n\nNationwide, bipartisan movement\n\nWHAT MATTERS: I think a lot of Americans would be kind of surprised that these experiments are going on right now. What is the larger lay of the land? Are there other states moving in this direction?\n\nTROIANO: Yes, there’s a growing movement across the country to solve the primary problem in different ways.\n\nJust within the last year, several states have expanded the use of ranked-choice voting on a bipartisan basis, including Virginia, Colorado and Utah, and other states have opened primaries to independent voters, such as Maine.\n\nIn November, Nevada will be the next state to have a ballot initiative with the same Alaska policy of top five primaries and ranked-choice voting.\n\nSo there are different flavors of reform bubbling up across the country in recognition that if we truly want to change the outcomes of the political system, we have to reform our elections.\n\nRed states, blue states\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You have real reform happening in a blue state like Maine and a red state like Alaska. It’s happening in California and Utah, which runs counter to the idea that Americans can’t agree on anything.\n\nTROIANO: Exactly. I think this issue can unite Americans left, right and center that they should have the power to choose their representatives – and that their representatives should represent them, not the party bosses or special interests.\n\nAnd so much like the Progressive Era reforms 100 years ago, I think we’re entering a new era of reimagining what democracy can be in the 21st century.\n\nRecognizing that what we have now not only isn’t working, but it’s actually a threat to the republic, in terms of growing extremism.\n\nOpposition based on power, not party\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The people or entities that stand to lose in this kind of change are political parties. What kind of opposition do these kind of movements run into from the parties?\n\nTROIANO: The good news is that I’d be worried if we were not attracting political opposition – that would mean the status quo isn’t threatened by these reforms.\n\nI think there is bipartisan support and there is bipartisan opposition to reform, and the fault line is not based on party. It’s based on power.\n\nOn one hand, you have those who want to protect their power at all costs. And on the other, you have leaders who want to put country over party. And I think the politicians would be smart to know where the voters are on this issue. Because the current system is not sustainable in its current form.\n\nGiven the chance, voters choose to change things. Politicians fight them\n\nWHAT MATTERS: It was voters who chose ranked-choice voting in Maine and Alaska, not legislatures. Voters in Maine had to vote for change twice. When voters are given the option to change the system, they take it. But that often the requires overcoming the institutions that have built up around them.\n\nTROIANO: Winning these reforms at the ballot is necessary but not sufficient. The movement needs to remain engaged to protect them as well, because the political establishment will fight tooth and nail to keep its power over a dysfunctional system. But as we’ve seen time and time again, people will ultimately prevail.\n\nWhat about long waits for results?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: One major gripe with ranked-choice voting in particular – you see the same thing with automatic runoffs in Louisiana and Georgia – is that it takes time to count these votes or wait for the runoff to occur. You don’t have the immediate decision. We see that in Alaska. That was the case in New York, where it took quite a long time to figure out who won the Democratic mayoral primary. Is that a flaw?\n\nTROIANO: The extended post-election counting period in those cases were because those municipalities and states were required to wait a certain length of time to count mail ballots. The actual tabulation for ranked-choice voting happens very quickly, which is why it is also called instant runoff.\n\nAnd so ranked-choice voting is a much better, faster and cheaper way of holding runoff elections than we see in states that require voters to actually go back to the polls.\n\nChanging the outcome of elections is not the point\n\nWHAT MATTERS: One of the big opponents to ranked-choice voting was then-Gov. Paul LePage of Maine. He won without a clear majority some years ago. Is there another example of an election in recent US history that you think might have had a different outcome under ranked-choice voting?\n\nTROIANO: I think the main purpose of these reforms isn’t necessarily about changing who wins, but in giving every voter an opportunity to fully express themselves and to improve the incentives that our elected leaders have to represent them.\n\nRight now, we only have about 10% of the public electing more than 80% of Congress because of partisan primaries. And that’s what produces a very unaccountable Congress.\n\nThe larger effect could be on Congress\n\nWHAT MATERS: Is Congress more important in terms of ranked-choice voting than the presidential election would be?\n\nTROIANO: I think all elections can benefit by ensuring that whoever wins has majority support.\n\nThe power of the Alaska reform is that it doesn’t have to exist in all 50 states for it to have a transformative impact on Congress.\n\nImagine if five more states voted the way Alaska did. That’s 10 more US senators who would be liberated from the grips of party primaries and empowered to put country over party. And that’s a coalition that could truly help address some of the country’s largest challenges in Congress.\n\nThe goal is for Congress to represent more of the country\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What is the ideal future for US presidential and congressional elections?\n\nTROIANO: Instead of 10% of the country electing 83% of Congress, the ideal future is that Congress actually represents a majority of Americans so that the public can see their hopes and desires translated into public policy. That’s what democracy is all about.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What are the specific places to keep an eye on?\n\nTROIANO: I think I touched on Nevada because that’s going to be a significant ballot campaign for November.\n\nI should mention eight municipalities will have ranked-choice voting on the ballot in November as well, including Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. There are many legislative campaigns underway, whether for reforms like ranked-choice voting or open primaries across the country.\n\nHow did this start?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Is there a tipping point in recent history or some moment that you can point to when these reforms started happening more quickly?\n\nTROIANO: We’re giving an award to (former) Gov. (Arnold) Schwarzenegger in the coming weeks, and recognizing the 10-year anniversary of passing both redistricting reform and nonpartisan primaries in the largest state in the country, California.\n\nAnd I think Gov. Schwarzenegger was ahead of his time in seeing growing political polarization and knowing that part of his legacy was going to be solving that in a generational way.\n\nPrimary reform and redistricting reform in California a decade ago proved that even the hardest reforms can pass in the biggest states, and others have followed suit. Ranked-choice voting passed in 2016 in Maine, and the combination of nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting passed in Alaska in 2020. And now we’re seeing an accelerating movement.\n\nI can’t help but draw the parallel again to the Progressive Era a century ago. Direct primaries were invented in 1904 in Wisconsin, and within four years, a majority of states adopted them. So there’s historical precedent for the notion that a proof of concept can be established in one state and spread like wildfire once people realize its true value.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

That was nearly double the number of absentee and early votes in 2016, when 2.8 million votes total were cast in Indiana. The sheer volume of votes this election could prolong the wait for a final tally.\n\nUpdates:Live coverage from elections in Kentucky and Indiana\n\nVoters — some who waited in line for hours — were drawn to the polls by the wildly polarizing presidential race between Trump and Joe Biden. The two candidates spent the campaign attacking each other over personal and policy issues, while pitching their distinctly divergent views for the future of America on hot-button topics ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy to health care to racial justice.\n\nEarly results revealed a core constituency of about 60% of Indiana voters backing Trump, as well as the two statewide candidates on the GOP ticket, Gov Eric Holcomb and Attorney General candidate Todd Rokita. Holcomb declared the winner just minutes after all the polls closed.\n\nHoosiers also voted in one of the country's most closely wacthed and hotly contested congressional races, where Republican Victoria Spartz and Democrat Christina Hale were vying for the seat being vacated by Republican Susan Brooks. That race hovered near a 50-50 split for most of the early evening and was too close to call at press time.\n\nFor many Hoosier voters, Trump's handling of the economy before the pandemic and his staunch support for the Second Amendment were key to winning their votes.\n\nTani Hull, a 72-year-old retiree, voted at Greenbriar Mobile Home Park on Pendleton Pike for the first time since 1970. Hull felt strongly about casting a vote for President Trump, even though she hasn't liked his maskless rallies or his tweets. Still, she said she was swayed by the way he helped with the pre-pandemic economy and brought jobs back from Mexico and China.\n\nJorge Dominguez, 31, tried to vote multiple times before Election Day but was unsuccessful. So he waited in line Tuesday to cast a ballot for Joe Biden. Dominguez said he is a first-time voter who came to the U.S. as a small child and gained citizenship through his father. He takes issue with Trump's immigration policies, citing \"kids in cages and stuff.\"\n\n“I just want to make my voice heard,\" he said. \"We’ve had a rough four years, and I don’t want to go through that again.”\n\nBrittany Rissler is an office designer, a job hard hit as many work from home during the pandemic. She wore a mask of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to vote in Noblesville and said racial justice, stemming from issues of police brutality and inequality, is the most important to her this year.\n\n“It’s been so eye-opening,\" Rissler said. \"Something needs to happen.”\n\nHyde Heckman, a Republican, said she voted a split ticket. Heckman said she feels the party has moved away from her core moral values since Trump was elected, and the 2018 school shooting in Noblesville motivated her to get more involved.\n\nFor some, like Linda Ford and her daughter, Amarr Boss, going to the polls together is a rite of passage. Ford, 52, and Boss, 18, went to the polls together Tuesday. It was Boss' first time voting.\n\n“My mom took me to the polls when I turned 18, and I’m 52 now. We’ve come a long way just to be able to have this privilege,” Ford said, adding that to be both Black and a woman makes voting even more of a privilege.\n\nFord said she wants her daughter \"to understand the importance of\" voting.\n\n\"If you don’t get out and vote, you can’t control what’s going on,\" Ford said. \"You can’t really complain about what’s going on because you didn’t take part in trying to make a change.”\n\nJeff Pea, a 43-year-old electrician, stood outside at the Hamilton County Fairgrounds holding campaign signs. For Pea, important issues include gun rights and keeping privatized medicine so he can choose his own doctor. That's why he voted for Trump.\n\n“The reason I support Trump is I look at him like how I would be if I’m president,\" Pea said. \"I’m going to speak my mind, I might not make everybody happy all the time, but I’m going to have the best intentions for the country at heart.”\n\nTrump carried Indiana easily in 2016, when he defeated Hillary Clinton with 57% of the vote to Clinton's 38%. Whether the incumbent can win in Indiana by that margin, particularly with the high turnout, remains to be seen. But with 28% of the voted counted at 8 p.m., Trump was seeing a slightly larger level of support as in 2016.\n\nIndiana has only gone blue once since 2000. That was in 2008, when Hoosiers picked Barack Obama over John McCain. But even then, Obama carried the state with slightly less than half the votes cast — 48.9% to 47.9%.\n\nThat race also attracted the largest voter turnout, as a percentage of registered voters — 62% — since before 2000. Turnout in 2016 was 58%, and based on early voting the 2020 election could set a new record for turnout.\n\nWith 60% of the voted counted at 9:15 p.m. Tuesday night, Trump had 60% of the vote. If that pattern, which emerged shortly after the polls close at 6 p.m., holds Trump will likely end up with more votes and a higher percentage of the total.\n\nContact Tim Evans at 317-444-6204 or tim.evans@indystar.com.

I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?\"\n\nAs Trump's support erodes among voters ages 65 and older, women and suburban voters, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has taken a double-digit lead in several national polls and widened margins in battleground states.\n\n'Would you please like me?' Trump appeals to suburban women during Pennsylvania rally\n\nThe former vice president's position has brought back memories from 2016 when Democrat Hillary Clinton led in polls three weeks from Election Day, before Trump's victory. Trump faces a problem unlike four years ago: The majority of voters – 95% or higher in most polls – say they have already decided who they're backing and can't be persuaded.\n\nAdding to the troubles for the president: More than 26 million people have voted early, and Democrats have a major advantage in mail-in voting.\n\n\"I think it's vitally important that the current president move out of the White House and on to his business practices,\" said Bob Lowe, 72, a retired superintendent from Le Center, Minnesota, who voted for Biden after backing Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in 2016.\n\n'Staggering numbers': Early voting breaks records in 2020, fueled by a big mail ballot lead for Democrats\n\nLowe, a political independent, is \"not enamored by either candidate\" but called Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic \"nothing short of abysmal\" and said his \"personality, actions and behaviors demean the office of the president of the United States.\" He said he made up his mind in August and doesn't have any friends or family members still undecided: \"I think the lines have been drawn, perhaps for some time.\"\n\nBiden polling above 50%, a mark Clinton rarely reached\n\nThere are fewer undecided voters in this year's election and not as many considering a third-party candidate. Biden has eclipsed an important mark. He consistently wins support in polls from more than 50% of voters, while Clinton typically polled in the high- or mid-40s in October before the 2016 election.\n\nStrong opinions about Trump after his four years in the White House have proved challenging for the president. Biden, lacking the high negative marks that Clinton did, turned into an elusive target for the Trump campaign. It has made for a remarkably stable race with little tightening in polls compared with past elections.\n\nTrump has not led in the Real Clear Politics' average of national polls since Biden became the Democratic nominee in August. Biden's lowest mark has been 48.7%. Trump's highest has been 43.3%.\n\nAn NPR/Marist University poll released Thursday found Biden ahead of Trump 54%-43% among likely voters. Only 2% say they are unsure whom they will vote for, and 1% say they back a third-party candidate. Only 5% of voters say they could be persuaded to change their opinions.\n\nThe week in polls: Biden hits double-digit lead in national average, surges in Florida, Michigan\n\n\"It's an incredibly low number,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. \"President Trump's strategy from the time he took office was to keep the base hopping. Because of his personality, it ends up a referendum on him when he really needs to make it a choice, and he hasn't been able to do that.\"\n\nMiringoff said, \"There's very few people who are looking over the choices right now. That makes it very uphill for the president. It's a very steep incline for him. People are comparing it to 2016, but I think it's a very false comparison.\"\n\nIn the Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Biden held a 51.3%-42.3% lead over Trump among likely voters as of Saturday. Trump was at roughly that same position in 2016, 42.2%, but Clinton's polling average was lower than Biden's, at 47.7%.\n\nThe percentage of undecided voters in October polls four years ago generally ranged from 4% to 9%. The 2016 race was much more fluid.\n\nClinton and Trump received sizable bounces after their party's conventions. Trump captured the lead in late July. In the last month of the race, Clinton got a boost after the release of Trump's \"Access Hollywood\" recording – in which he made vulgar comments about women – followed by a bounce for Trump after FBI Director James Comey announced an investigation into emails on Clinton's personal server.\n\nElection week? Maybe not: Arizona, Florida and others could give early indication of who is winning\n\nFewer voters consider third-party candidates\n\nIn addition to more undecided voters in 2016, more voters were willing to vote for Johnson and another third-party candidate, Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Johnson finished with 3.3% of the vote and Stein 1.1%, enough to be a factor in several battleground states that Trump won by narrow margins.\n\nIn an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken Oct. 8-10, 2016, Johnson polled at 9% and Stein at 2%. This year's third-party candidates – Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins and rapper Kanye West – barely register in most polls and Hawkins and West won't be on every state's ballot.\n\n\"It runs counter to the idea that there's a hidden Trump vote,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"Part of the reason in 2016 that some of the states tipped Trump was because of the presence of third-party candidates, both Libertarian and Green, and a higher undecided.\"\n\nMore:Could Kanye West's 2020 bid hurt Joe Biden and give a 'Hail Mary' boost to Donald Trump?\n\nPaleologos said 2020 hasn't mirrored 2016 because Biden has not become polarizing like Clinton and Trump. The Trump campaign has tried to bring down Biden's favorability ratings – painting him as a socialist, calling him mentally unfit and pushing corruption accusations about his son Hunter – but the attacks have largely fallen flat.\n\nPaleologos said that four years ago, many voters disliked Clinton \"with a higher intensity\" than they disliked Trump.\n\n\"This time, you don't have that,\" Paleologos said. \"You certainly have a negative on Trump, people who feel unfavorable to him, but it's not matched to an unfavorable for Biden. There's less interest in waffling. And there's less interest in voting for a third-party candidate.\"\n\nTrump sticks to game plan\n\nFour years after Democrats felt burned by polls, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon sought to dispel any complacency and early celebrating among the left last week.\n\n\"There is still a long way to go in this campaign, and we think this race is far closer than folks on this website think,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Like a lot closer.\"\n\nAs cases spike, Trump's ad strategy targets senior citizens: He recovered from COVID-19, so can America\n\nBiden leads senior voters by about 20 percentage points in some battleground states. Despite seeing his support among seniors nosedive during the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has not altered his approach to try to persuade voters.\n\nA combative Trump was on display during Thursday's town hall in Miami hosted by NBC News that featured uncommitted voters. Trump refused to denounce QAnon, falsely said 85% of people who wear masks get the coronavirus and said he couldn't remember whether he tested negative for coronavirus before the first presidential debate. \"So cute,\" he said to moderator Savannah Guthrie as she pressed him on QAnon conspiracy theories.\n\nMore:Trump, Biden dueling town halls gave voters a different view of the candidates\n\nOne voter at the town hall, Paulette Dale, a registered Republican who said she's leaning toward voting for Biden, told the president, \"I have to say, you have a great smile. You're so handsome when you smile.\"\n\nYet even she's made her mind up. The Miami New Times reported Friday Dale is sticking with her plans to vote for Biden on Monday when early voting in Florida kicks off. \"I wish he would smile more and talk less,\" Dale, a retired professor at Miami Dade College, told the newspaper.\n\nTrump won many late-breaking voters in 2016, but this year, he's struggled to keep his coalition intact.\n\n\"Biden's doing better among white voters. He's made some inroads into people without college education,\" said Miringoff, who oversaw the NPR/Marist poll. \"And he's made significant inroads into people who are over 65. It's really a different slice of the electorate.\"\n\nMike Loewenstein, 72, a self-described moderate conservative from Ocala, Florida – a retiree-heavy community where Trump campaigned Friday – voted for Trump four years ago. He has second thoughts about doing so this year, arguing Trump \"blew his leadership role\" addressing the pandemic. \"A national emergency of that size, he blew it as a leader. He blew it politically.\"\n\nMore:Trump courts Florida seniors as polls show him lagging with voting bloc\n\nLoewenstein, a retired call center director, is not sold on Biden either and said he plans to review last week's dueling town halls to see whether \"anybody actually said anything that makes sense to me.\"\n\n\"I'm looking at what they've actually accomplished versus what's said,\" Loewenstein said. \"Once I make up my mind, I'll make up mind, and I'll just do it.\"\n\nGilbert Lightbourne, 66, an automotive consultant from Miami Gardens, Florida, decided months ago.\n\n\"(Trump's) very divisive. I don't think right now he's the person to run the country. Too much drama, let me put it that way,\" said Gilbert, a Democrat who plans to vote for Biden. \"I'd just like to get this over and done and our country headed in the right direction.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/26/chicago-mayor-election-2019-toni-preckwinkle-lori-lightfoot-bill-daley/2991807002/", "title": "Chicago mayor's race: City will elect its first black female mayor", "text": "CHICAGO – Former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle are headed to an April 2 runoff to decide who will become the nation’s third-largest city’s next mayor, topping a crowded field of 14 candidates.\n\nThe winner will become Chicago's first black woman mayor, and will make Chicago the largest U.S. city to be led by one. If Lightfoot prevails, she will also be the city's first out LGBT mayor.\n\nLightfoot had 17.5 percent of the vote and Preckwinkle had 16 percent with 96 percent of precincts counted. Neither achieved the outright majority needed to forestall a runoff.\n\nFormer U.S. Commerce Secretary Bill Daley, who had 14.8 percent of the vote, conceded late Tuesday and congratulated Lightfoot and Preckwinkle.\n\nLightfoot, 56, grew up in Ohio and came to Chicago to attend law school at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"This is what change looks like,\" she said. \"It's true that not every day, a little black girl in a low-income family from a segregated steel town makes the runoff to be the mayor of the third-largest city in the country.\"\n\nPreckwinkle, 71, a former alderman and head of the Cook County Democratic Party, has long been a force in Chicago politics. As she celebrated moving on to a runoff, she aimed to tie Lightfoot to the administrations of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and former Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nEmanuel appointed her to the Chicago Police Board and the city's Police Accountability Task Force. Daley named her in 2002 as chief administrator of the Office of Professional Standards, a disciplinary arm of the Chicago Police Department that has since been abolished.\n\nPreckwinkle also jabbed at Lightfoot's lack of experience in electoral office.\n\n\"It's not enough to stand at a podium and talk about what you want to see happen,\" Preckwinkle said. \"You have to come to this job with the capacity and capability to make your vision a reality.\"\n\nPolls leading up to the vote Tuesday showed at least six candidates with a serious shot at finishing in the top two, but none coming close to a majority.\n\nThe top contenders going into Tuesday included Preckwinkle, Lightfoot, Daley, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, former Chicago school board president Gery Chico and businessman Willie Wilson. Daley, Chico and Mendoza conceded within three hours of the polls closing.\n\n\"Tonight's results were not what we hoped. But we cannot dwell on what could have been,\" Daley told supporters. \"We must look forward to how we can help shape our city’s future.\n\n\"Chicago is a part of me. It always will be. While I may not be its next mayor, I won’t stop fighting to move our city forward.\"\n\nA victory by Daley, the son and brother of mayors, would have meant the return of one of the nation’s most famous political clans to the fifth floor of City Hall. His father, Richard J. Daley, and his brother, Richard M. Daley, served a combined 43 years.\n\nLightfoot raised about $1.2 million for the campaign, least among the top three. Preckwinkle raised $4.6 million; Daley raised $8.7 million.\n\nTogether, the 14 candidates and independent groups hauled in nearly $30 million to besiege Chicagoans with an inescapable loop of television and digital advertising, campaign calls and mailers.\n\nAlso on the ballot were races for city council, clerk and treasurer.\n\nPreckwinkle cast her ballot at an elementary school in the city’s Hyde Park neighborhood.\n\n“This is a historic moment for the city,” she said. “I am proud of the work of my campaign and feel optimistic as we head into tonight.\"\n\nElection officials said turnout was low. Only a third of the city's 1.58 million registered voters cast a ballot.\n\nMost of the field, including Preckwinkle, entered the race after Emanuel announced in September he would not seek a third term. Lightfoot announced her candidacy before Emanuel's announcement, boasting that she didn't fear taking on \"Goliath.\"\n\nEmanuel, a former congressman, White House chief of staff to President Barack Obama and cabinet secretary under President Bill Clinton, is a prodigious fundraiser who amassed $10 million in campaign contributions before announcing he wouldn’t seek reelection.\n\nHe had become a polarizing figure in the city.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union called a 7-day strike in 2012, the first work stoppage in the school district in 25 years. Emanuel drew criticism for closing 50 Chicago Public Schools during his first term, the vast majority impacting black and Latino children.\n\nAnd he saw his standing plummet in the city’s African-American community after the court-ordered release in late 2015 of chilling police video that showed Jason Van Dyke, a white officer, firing 16 shots at Laquan McDonald, a black teen.\n\nEmanuel had resisted releasing the video. It spurred weeks of protests.\n\nCliff notes:Chicago votes for a new mayor: 5 things to know about historic race\n\nAlderman's shakedown:In corruption-plagued Chicago, high-level shakedown charges loom over mayoral race, candidates\n\nAnother Daley:Will Chicago elect a third Mayor Daley? It's starting to look like a distinct possibility\n\nThe next mayor will inherit major challenges, including unusually high levels of gun violence, a woefully underfunded municipal workers pension program, and a shrinking population.\n\nChicago recorded 561 homicides last year, an improvement over the previous year but far more than in larger New York and Los Angeles. The city suffered nearly 2,000 homicides from 2016 to 2018, a period when most of the nation saw homicide rates near historic lows.\n\nSome voters remained undecided right up until they arrived at their polling places. Juan Toleltino, 63, said he was torn between Daley, Mendoza and Chico.\n\nWhoever wins, he said, must address the killings and shootings.\n\n“The first thing I want to see them do is deal with the gun violence,” Toleltino said. “We got to get it under control.”\n\nThe city is also weighed down by roughly $28 billion in unmet municipal worker pension obligations. At the same time, the population has plummeted – Houston is on pace to pass the city as the nation’s third largest in the next decade – while the chasm between rich and poor has grown.\n\nIn 1970, about half of Chicago’s census tracts were classified as middle-income areas, according to a study by the Voorhees Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Only 16 percent of the tracts were classified as middle income in 2017, according to the study.\n\nThe difficulties are particularly notable in huge swaths of the city’s South and West sides, predominantly African-American neighborhoods that have lost the most population.\n\nThe race was shaken up last month when federal authorities announced charges of attempted extortion against Alderman Ed Burke, a powerful 50-year veteran of the city council.\n\nBurke, who won reelection to another four-year term Tuesday, is accused of shaking down the operators of Burger King restaurants in Illinois. He has pleaded not guilty, and is running for re-election.\n\nFour of the top candidates, including Preckwinkle, had ties to the alderman and found themselves scrambling to distance themselves.\n\nPreckwinkle received more than $100,000 from a Burke-sponsored fundraiser last year. Mendoza was married at Burke’s home. Burke endorsed Chico, who worked as an aide to the alderman 30 years ago. Daley's family has received about $30,000 in political donations from Burke over decades.\n\nWhile political corruption has grabbed headlines, financial stability was cited by 18 percent of voters as the top issue facing the city – a higher concern than any other issue, according to a 270 Strategies poll published Sunday.\n\nBetsy Tavizon said she voted for Preckwinkle – the “least worst” of the choices.\n\nTavison, 29, said she was looking for a candidate who spoke to her concerns about the rising cost of living in the city. She thinks about leaving Chicago because she finds it difficult to imagine a scenario in which she’d ever be able to become a homeowner.\n\n“It was a difficult decision,” Tavizon said. “I didn’t make my choice until last night.\"\n\nDane Lopez, 41, was most concerned about the impact gentrification was having on his neighborhood, Humboldt Park. His neighborhood, home to one of the country’s biggest Puerto Rican communities, has become more affluent over the last two decades, and rising real estate prices, rents and property taxes have made it difficult for many of his longtime neighbors to keep up.\n\nHe decided to vote for Mendoza, in part because she was the only candidate to visit his church and ask for the community’s support.\n\n“She said she’s going to put the focus in the community,” Lopez said. “It was difficult sorting out who to vote for, but she was one that connected the most to my values.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/26"}]}

He added that it meant a lot to have his mother in attendance.\n\n“I’m nothing without my family,” Judge said. “They mean the world to me. They’re the reason I’m here, the reason why I’m the person I am and getting to share this moment with my mom and also trying to give a little nod to Roger Maris Jr., it means a lot.”\n\nJudge is the sixth player in major league history to hit at least 60 home runs in a single season, but downplayed his record-setting season.\n\n“I haven’t really been thinking about numbers or stats and stuff like that,” he told reporters. “I’m going out there trying to help my team win.”\n\nAfter hitting his 394-foot home run, Judge received a standing ovation from the Toronto crowd and was greeted by teammates as he touched home plate.\n\nThe Yankees, crowned AL East champions on Tuesday, went on to defeat the Blue Jays 8-3. Judge’s next chance to break the record will come on Friday when the Yankees host the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n“I keep saying over and over, Aaron Judge; everyone should just watch and take notice,” Yankees head coach Aaron Boone said last week after Judge hit his 60th home run. “I can say this because I’ve lived this, and he’s shown this: he puts his focus on being a great teammate and winning. He knows everything else will take care of itself.”\n\nWith seven regular season games remaining, Judge is unlikely to reach the major league single-season record of 73 home runs.\n\nBut many have brushed the record aside because it’s currently held by Barry Bonds who – along with other players of that era – was embroiled in performance-enhancing drug scandals and allegedly used steroids. Bonds and Sammy Sosa have denied those allegations.\n\nJudge disagrees, telling Sports Illustrated recently that “73 is the record In my book.” But Maris’ son, Roger Maris Jr., said on Wednesday that Judge should be “revered for being the actual single-season home run champ.

Still, he was able to get back on his bike and reach the finish shortly after his countryman Steve Cummings won the first of four stages in the Pyrenees with a solo attack on the Col d'Aspin climb.\n\n\"I had no time to react,\" Yates said after getting his chin stitched up. \"It's a good thing it was just me on my own.

The last time we saw the Crimson Tide, it was losing in stunning fashion, 44-16 to Clemson in the College Football Playoff national championship game. That was followed by dramatic turnover in the coaching staff. But even if urgency does not have to be manufactured in Tuscaloosa this offseason, there’s also not much reason for concern – the dynasty is not crumbling away.\n\nBut at least one thing has to get fixed.\n\n“I never noticed my hip at all until the first day of spring practice,” Saban told USA TODAY Sports. “I ran out on the field and it felt like I got a hip flexor. It didn’t feel like it was some injury or something like that, but it never went away and it actually kept almost getting worse.”\n\nSaban has exhibited vitality that makes him seem younger than his age. He said if he weren’t coaching he would postpone the procedure for as long as he could – “If I was a normal guy,” he put it, “I would wait and not do this right now” – which is why in one way, the decision serves as a tangible answer to an annual offseason question.\n\nFollow every game: Live NCAA College Football Scores\n\n“I don’t want to coach for one more year,” Saban told reporters after Alabama’s spring game. “I want to coach for a lot of more years.”\n\nBut the job entails an active, physical lifestyle, even during the offseason.\n\nSPRING OUTLOOKS: ACC | Big Ten | Big 12 | Southeastern | Pac-12\n\nLIONS UNCERTAINTY:Penn State's projected quarterback Stevens to transfer\n\nLOOKING AHEAD:Early Top 25 college football teams for 2019\n\n“I don’t want to be in position where I can’t do that,” he said.\n\nAnd Saban, who was limping while moving around the Alabama football facility earlier this week, said the pain is pronounced in certain activities – and nonexistent in others. Climbing stairs, running, sometimes even bending over to tie his shoes is painful.\n\n“That’s what gets me,” he said. “But turning and swinging a golf club? It hurts more to get out of the cart than it does to swing the club.”\n\nSaban expects to be up and around shortly after the procedure, which is scheduled for Monday. But his golf season, which typically begins after spring practice and runs into the summer, will be curtailed.\n\n“The only thing I hate about it is, I’ll have to not play golf for six weeks or so,” he said. “… But this is the best time for me to do it. I do a lot of speaking and evaluating and film work and stuff like that, but we’re not practicing. Other than playing golf, I probably wouldn’t be very active.

Ramaphosa is expected to be elected swiftly in a parliament vote and sworn in as leader of one of Africa’s biggest economies.\n\nZuma said earlier that he’s done nothing wrong and resisted the party's push to resign. That set the stage for his almost certain removal in a parliamentary vote scheduled for Thursday.\n\nMore:South Africa's President Jacob Zuma's resigns: Here's what you need to know\n\n“I’m being victimized here,” Zuma said, complaining that Ramaphosa and other party leaders had not given him clear reasons why he should leave.\n\nZuma, who took office in 2009, has been embroiled in corruption scandals throughout most of his two terms. Late last year, South Africa's top court ruled that he violated the constitution when he paid for multimillion-dollar upgrades to his private home with state funds.\n\nA judicial commission could soon begin to examine allegations of influence peddling and illegal contracts to Zuma cronies. Prosecutors are also mulling reviving corruption charges tied to an arms deal two decades ago.\n\nOn Wednesday, police raided the home of prominent business associates of Zuma accused of being at the center of the corruption scandals that have infuriated the country.\n\nThe ongoing scandals have sunk the popularity of the ANC, which holds stature as a key player that fought white minority rule and is credited with the dismantling of apartheid in 1991.\n\n\"He has really put the country in a state of turmoil,\" said Kealan Anderson, 25, a fiber optic technician in Johannesburg. \"It will be in the best interest of the country for him to not be in charge.\"\n\nEbrahim Fakir, a political researcher and commentator here, noted that Zuma was forced out of office by the rule of law without violence — and not by a coup. .\n\n\"His resignation makes us exceptional on the African continent,\" Fakir said. \"Zuma saved himself, but it did show that if he refused to go, the party, parliament and the constitution would have kicked in its safeguards.\"\n\nPoliticians from the party looking to next year's elections worry about the corruption probes.\n\n\"There is a question of the next election and people retaining their jobs, but it's also (about law enforcement) now starting to move forward on prosecutions and arrests,\" Fakir said. \"There are two fears — a loss of support and also the shame and embarrassment of your people being caught.\"\n\nSome voters, like Zubair Rwat, 40, said they will take a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\"This was simply the start of the ANC election campaign — a good start, nonetheless,\" said Rawat, an anesthesiologist in Johannesburg. \"But to get my vote I want them all to be prosecuted and all the money retrieved.\"\n\nDana Toerien, 26, a scriptwriter in Johannesburg, is cautiously optimistic. \"We need to see action rather than words before we can make any concrete judgments.\"\n\nZuma still has allies, especially in his home state of Kwazulu-Nata, and his legacy as a freedom fighter was revered. Zuma has been part of the ANC for almost six decades and led the intelligence arm of the movement's underground military wing. He was jailed for 10 years on Robben Island where Nelson Mandela, the country's first black president, was also held.\n\nThe ANC paid tribute to that legacy.\n\n\"Having taken the difficult decision to recall ... Zuma, the African National Congress nonetheless wants to salute the outstanding contribution he has made and express its profound gratitude to him for the role he has played ... spanning over 60 years of loyal service,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nDurando reported from McLean, Va.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/09/14/rodrguez-a-2525-rookie-mariners-beat-padres-6-1/50736707/", "title": "Rodríguez a 25/25 rookie, Mariners beat Padres 6-1", "text": "AP\n\nSEATTLE (AP) — Julio Rodríguez hit the fourth leadoff home run of his rookie season, Eugenio Suárez and Carlos Santana both went deep, and the Seattle Mariners beat the San Diego Padres 6-1 on Wednesday.\n\nSeattle rebounded quickly from being shut out for the first time in nearly three months and split the brief two-game set.

He singled in the fifth after Aaron Hicks reached on an error, putting runners on first and second.\n\nTorres lined a single to right, and Alex Verdugo’s throw to the plate was too late to get Hicks. Catcher Connor Wong thought he had Torres making too big of a turn and fired the ball to first but it sailed wide and into the outfield.\n\nJudge came around to score, and Torres beat Verdugo’s second throw home for the three-run, Little League homer that gave New York a 3-0 lead.

The actress, a graduate of California State University in Hayward (now California State University, East Bay) who studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, appeared in films such as 1973's \"Counselor at Crime,\" 1974's \"The Trial of Billy Jack\" and 1975's \"Johnny Firecloud.\"\n\nShe went on to co-found the National American Indian Performing Arts Registry.\n\n'Never thought I'd live to see the day':Oscars apologize to Sacheen Littlefeather for mocked speech\n\nIn 2018, Littlefeather revealed she was battling Stage 4 breast cancer.\n\nHer death came weeks after she received a long-overdue apology from the Academy Awards. Nearly 50 years ago, the actress and activist rejected an Oscar on behalf of \"The Godfather\" star Brando, who boycotted the ceremony to protest Hollywood's negative portrayals of Native Americans. Littlefeather delivered a speech on his behalf, which was roundly mocked and booed by many members of the audience.\n\nOn Sept. 17, Littleweather was honored in \"An Evening With Sacheen Littlefeather,\" billed as a program of \"conversation, reflection, healing and celebration\" at the Academy Museum in Los Angeles.

The fantasy of American Indians has replaced the reality of American Indians in people's minds.\"\n\nThe 12 most shocking moments in Oscars history:From Marlon Brando to 'Moonlight'\n\nLittlefeather became the first Native American woman to speak on stage at the Oscars. Wearing a buckskin dress and moccasins, she delivered a 60-second speech explaining that Brando could not accept the award because of \"the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry.\"\n\nLittlefeather and Brando met through her neighbor, “Godfather” director Francis Ford Coppola. She had known Brando for about a year before he called her the night before the Oscars ceremony, invited her to his house and asked her to attend in his place.\n\nThe 1973 Oscars were held during the American Indian Movement’s two-month occupation of Wounded Knee in South Dakota, which Brando referenced in the speech she delivered.\n\nAs she exited the Oscars stage after the speech, \"I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them,\" she told Variety recently. \"I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement.\"\n\nPolitical speeches at the Oscars were then still a rarity, and some in attendance saw the brief address as a break in decorum — and one that raised a subject not everyone was eager to consider.\n\n\"I don’t know if I should present this award on behalf of all the cowboys shot in all the John Ford Westerns over the years,\" Clint Eastwood said later in the evening, while presenting the award for best picture. Presenting best actress, presenter Raquel Welch cracked: \"I hope they haven’t got a cause.\"\n\n\"I went up there thinking I could make a difference,\" Littlefeather told People magazine in 1990. \"I was very naive. I told people about oppression. They said, 'You’re ruining our evening.' \"\n\nLittlefeather described the overwhelmingly white crowd as \"a sea of Clorox.\" She said some audience members did the so-called \"tomahawk chop\" and that Brando’s house was later shot at.\n\nIn the years since, Littlefeather said she had been discriminated against and personally attacked for her brief appearance. On Sunday, the Academy shared a quote from the civil rights activist that read: \"When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive.\"\n\nHer family asked that donations be made to the American Indian Child Resource Center of Oakland, California.\n\nContributing: Jake Coyle, The Associated Press, and Kim Willis, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/entertainment/sacheen-littlefeather-dead-marlon-brando-intl-scli/index.html", "title": "Sacheen Littlefeather, Native American activist and actress, dead at ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSacheen Littlefeather, the Native American actress and activist who made history when she declined the Best Actor Oscar on behalf of Marlon Brando, has died at the age of 75.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced her death on Monday in a post shared on Twitter.\n\nThe tweet, accompanied by an image of the Apache and Yaqui actress, read: “Sacheen Littlefeather, Native American civil rights activist who famously declined Marlon Brando’s 1973 Best Actor Academy Award, dies at 75.”\n\nWhile no cause of death was immediately given, Littlefeather disclosed in a Facebook post in January last year that she had metastasized breast cancer.\n\nSacheen Littlefeather speaks on behalf of Marlon Brando at the 45th Academy Awards.

Gone were Green’s iconic go-go boots, replaced by sneakers. Online, mayhem ensued.\n\nNow, M&M’S is making another, bigger change — this time, it’s adding a brand new character to the mix. Meet Purple: She’s peanut, she sings, and she doesn’t wear high heels (she sports lace-up boots).\n\nThe purple peanut M&M is the first new character in 10 years, according to the brand.\n\n“Purple has been in the works for a very long time, for years,” said Jane Hwang, Global Vice President of M&M’S. “This was about ensuring that the entire crew, the entire cast of spokescandies, were reflecting the world that we’re living in.”\n\nM&M'S\n\nPurple has a specific personality — quirky, confident and just a little awkward. Her debut comes with a song, “I’m Just Gonna Be Me,” which can be seen in a video online and streamed on platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that a purple M&M is coming to bags of Peanut M&M’S, however.\n\nThe new character will appear in stores, on the M&M’S website and on some limited edition packaging, said Hwang. And customers will be able to buy purple M&M’S online, an option that was already available. But when it comes to a regular bag of peanut M&M’S, purple fans are out of luck.\n\nThat could be a new source of outrage.\n\nIn the mid-90s, people voted for blue to replace tan in bags of the candy. In 2002, M&M’S once again asked people to vote, this time for a color that would be added for just a limited time. Purple won, but didn’t stick around for long.\n\nOnline, people frequently ask why there are no purple M&M’S. Some bemoan the missed opportunity in the 1990s to make purple a permanent addition to the lineup. Some even think the vote was rigged.\n\nStill, the new character, while not an actual new candy, is an acknowledgment from M&M’S that people are pining for purple.\n\n“We’ve heard for a long time that purple is certainly a consumer favorite,” said Hwang.\n\nBut the brand is really focusing on the characters, rather than the actual edible candies, she noted.\n\n‘Give green her boots back’\n\nWhen M&M’S made changes to its characters’ footwear early this year, the idea was to make them more current and relevant, with characters that, Mars hopes, will make people feel like they belong. The new footwear was supposed to help telegraph that message. Orange finally got a pair of shoes with tied laces, Brown got lower heels, and others also got subtle updates to their style.\n\nBut there was an outsized reaction to Green’s new kicks.\n\nAn opinion piece in the Washington Post declared “The M&M’S changes aren’t progressive. Give Green her boots back.” In a provocatively-headlined article, Rolling Stone described the change as “nothing more than tectonic.” Thousands have signed a petition to “keep the green M&M sexy.”\n\nPeople are known to have strong feelings about things online, particularly changes to beloved characters. When Lola Bunny got a new look for the new Space Jam movie, for example, fans were outraged.\n\nBut for M&M’S, reaction to the character makeover was “unprecedented,” said Hwang. “We were incredibly overwhelmed,” she noted. “Now we know for certain that M&M’S is a cultural icon.”\n\nSo when it came to the new purple character, Hwang said, M&M’S didn’t take the reaction to Green into account. Purple “had nothing to do … with the commentaries we saw about Green,” she said.\n\nAnd for now, at least, M&M’S has no plans to restore Green’s look.\n\n“The characters … are continuously evolving to reflect the times that we’re living in,” Hwang said, adding that the brand hopes consumers will “get to know our characters for much more than their footwear.”\n\nSo will the go-go boots ever make a comeback? Hwang answered slyly, “You never know.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/business/mms-characters-logo/index.html", "title": "M&Ms' beloved characters are getting a new look | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nM&M’s branding is getting a refresh.\n\nThe candy’s anthropomorphized chocolate characters are being made over, and the logo is also getting a tweak.\n\nBut the most noticeable change is to the six M&M characters: new shoes. Green has swapped her go-go boots for sneakers. Brown is sporting lower, more sensible heels. Red and Yellow’s shoes now have laces. Orange’s shoes laces are no longer untied. And Blue’s shoes, while little changed, resemble what Anton Vincent, president of Mars Wrigley North America, described as “a bad version of Uggs.”\n\nM&Ms old logo and characters are shown on the left, and the new versions on the right. Changes include new footwear for the six characters and a straightened-out logo emphasizing the ampersand. M&Ms\n\nMars Wrigley, which owns M&Ms, is trying to make the characters — particularly the female ones — more “current” and “representative of our consumer,” Vincent said. The revamped footwear is “a subtle cue, but it’s a cue people really pick up on,” he added, noting that Mars gets a lot of feedback on the characters’ shoes.\n\nThe logo adjustment is also slight: Instead of resting on its side, it’s set up straight. The new orientation is designed to emphasize the ampersand. The logo was last tweaked in 2019.\n\nThe changes are rolling out online this week and they’ll be incorporated into M&Ms’ packaging and other marketing materials this year.\n\nThe changes may be subtle, but even small shifts can help brands avoid falling out of fashion, said David Camp, co-founder and managing partner of Metaforce, a marketing company. “Every brand has to continuously reinvent itself to remain relevant.”\n\nM&Ms were introduced in 1941. M&Ms\n\nBetter gender representation\n\nM&Ms were first sold in 1941, and the characters arrived on the scene in 1954. Old M&Ms commercials starred Red and Yellow, representing regular and peanut M&Ms. In the late 1990s, new characters were added to the mix. Brown, the most recent addition, joined the crew in 2012.\n\nOver the years the brand has switched between highlighting its characters more heavily or less frequently, Vincent noted. Now, it’s putting them front and center.\n\nM&M's packaging circa 2004. Stephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nCurrently, there are two female characters and four male ones. Adding another couple of female characters to balance out the ratio is possible, said Vincent, but there are “implications” for the product itself. Namely, M&Ms would have to add new permanent colors to its mix.\n\nThe solution, then, was to give the female Green and Brown a promotion. They’ll have more prominent placement in ads, with the aim of “a little bit more gender balance,” said Vincent.\n\nM&Ms is using these changes to try to signal its brand identity to customers, who are increasingly drawn to brands they feel align with their own values. “It gives us a good platform to talk about the whole idea around belonging,” Vincent said.\n\nThe company is also is placing more “focus on the characters as it relates to the total brand, and then building ourselves a platform to be able to advocate and talk about this idea,” he added.\n\nOther brands have made adjustments to their logos or mascots to keep them up-to-date. One example is Quaker, which in 2012 altered the face of its mascot like a discreet plastic surgeon. (Quaker is owned by Pepsico (PEP)). Changes included “remov[ing] his double chin and smooth[ing] the rolls and plumpness in his face and neck,” The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The new character’s shoulders are also more visible and his hair shorter, to make him seem more fit, and elongating his neck, the Journal noted.\n\nSome brands like Uncle Ben’s and Aunt Jemima recently have revised their logos, mascots or brand names because of problematic and racist origins.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/11/15/sesame-street-adds-new-character-asian-american-muppet-ji-young/8621812002/", "title": "'Sesame Street' adds new character: Asian American muppet Ji-Young", "text": "Terry Tang\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWhat's in a name? Well, for Ji-Young, the newest muppet resident of \"Sesame Street,\" her name is a sign she was meant to live there.\n\n\"So, in Korean traditionally the two syllables they each mean something different and Ji means, like, smart or wise. And Young means, like, brave or courageous and strong,\" Ji-Young explained during a recent interview. \"But we were looking it up and guess what? Ji also means sesame.\"\n\nAt only 7 years old, Ji-Young is making history as the first Asian American muppet in the \"Sesame Street\" canon. She is Korean American and has two passions: rocking out on her electric guitar and skateboarding. The children's TV program, which first aired 52 years ago this month, gave The Associated Press a first look at its adorable new occupant.\n\nJi-Young will formally be introduced in \"See Us Coming Together: A Sesame Street Special.\" Simu Liu, Padma Lakshmi and Naomi Osaka are among the celebrities appearing in the special, which will drop Thanksgiving Day on HBO Max, \"Sesame Street\" social media platforms and on local PBS stations.\n\nMore:Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka, more celebs join 'Sesame Street' for star-studded 52nd season\n\nMore:'SNL' pokes fun at Ted Cruz vs. Big Bird feud in 'Sesame Street' cold open sketch\n\nSome of Ji-Young's personality comes from her puppeteer. Kathleen Kim, 41 and Korean American, got into puppetry in her 30s. In 2014, she was accepted into a \"Sesame Street\" workshop. That evolved into a mentorship and becoming part of the team the following year. Being a puppeteer on a show Kim watched growing up was a dream come true. But helping shape an original muppet is a whole other feat.\n\n\"I feel like I have a lot of weight that maybe I'm putting on myself to teach these lessons and to be this representative that I did not have as a kid,\" Kim said. But fellow puppeteer Leslie Carrara-Rudolph — who performs Abby Cadabby — reminded her, \"It's not about us ... It's about this message.\"\n\nJi-Young's existence is the culmination of a lot of discussions after the events of 2020 — George Floyd's death and anti-Asian hate incidents. Like a lot of companies, \"Sesame Street\" reflected on how it could \"meet the moment,\" said Kay Wilson Stallings, executive vice-president of Creative and Production for Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nSesame Workshop established two task forces — one to look at its content and another to look at its own diversity. What developed was Coming Together, a multi-year initiative addressing how to talk to children about race, ethnicity and culture.\n\nOne result was 8-year-old Tamir. While not the show's first Black muppet, he was one of the first used to talk about subjects like racism.\n\n\"When we knew we were going to be doing this work that was going to focus on the Asian and Pacific Islanders experience, we of course knew we needed to create an Asian muppet as well,\" Stallings said.\n\nThese newer muppets — their personalities and their looks — were remarkably constructed in a matter of a months. The process normally takes at least a couple of years. There are outside experts and a cross-section of employees known as the \"culture trust\" who weigh in on every aspect of a new muppet, Stallings said.\n\nFor Kim, it was crucial that Ji-Young not be \"generically pan-Asian.\n\n\"Because that's something that all Asian Americans have experienced. They kind of want to lump us into this monolithic 'Asian,'\" Kim said. \"So it was very important that she was specifically Korean American, not just like, generically Korean, but she was born here.\"\n\nOne thing Ji-Young will help teach children is how to be a good \"upstander.\" \"Sesame Street\" first used the term on its \"The Power of We\" TV special last year, which featured Tamir.\n\n\"Being an upstander means you point out things that are wrong or something that someone does or says that is based on their negative attitude towards the person because of the color of their skin or the language they speak or where they're from,\" Stallings said. \"We want our audience to understand they can be upstanders.\"\n\nIn \"See Us Coming Together,\" Sesame Street is preparing for Neighbor Day where everyone shares food, music or dance from their culture. Ji-Young becomes upset after a kid, off screen, tells her \"to go back home,\" an insult commonly flung at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. But she feels empowered after Sesame Street's other Asian American residents, guest stars and friends like Elmo assure her that she belongs as much as anyone else.\n\nThe fact that Ji-Young was created to counter anti-Asian sentiment makes her more special to Kim in some ways.\n\n\"I remember like the Atlanta shootings and how terrifying that was for me,\" Kim said. \"My one hope, obviously, is to actually help teach what racism is, help teach kids to be able to recognize it and then speak out against it. But then my other hope for Ji-Young is that she just normalizes seeing different kinds of looking kids on TV.\"\n\nMore:There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.\n\nMore:‘Sesame Street’ to ‘Ridley Jones’: TV shows are teaching kids about LGBTQ issues, diversity\n\nVanessa Leung, co-executive director of Coalition for Asian American Children and Families, is excited about Ji-Young. The organization was not involved in Ji-Young's creation but previously consulted on anti-racism content for Sesame Workshop. It matters when Asian American families, especially with many of them being immigrant families, can see themselves reflected in an institution like \"Sesame Street,\" Leung said.\n\n\"It sparks curiosity and early understanding of the diversity of our community, the beauty in the diversity of our community,\" Leung said.\n\nJi-Young will be heavily present throughout the show's 53rd season next year, Stallings reassured. She also won't just be utilized for content related to racial justice. She will pop up in various digital programs, live-action and animated.\n\nAs the new kid on the street, Ji-Young is looking forward to showing her friends and neighbors aspects of Korean culture such as the food. She loves cooking dishes like tteokbokki (chewy rice cakes) with her halmoni (grandmother). And she already has one \"Sesame Street\" friend who wants a sample.\n\n\"I would love to try it,\" said Ernie, who joined Ji-Young's interview. \"You know, I've tried bulgogi. I really like bulgogi. I'm gonna guess that maybe old buddy Bert has not tried Korean food.\"\n\nHaving already made several famous friends on \"Sesame Street,\" is there anyone Ji-Young still really wants to meet?\n\n\"The Linda Lindas because they're so cool,\" Ji-Young said, referring to the teenage punk rock band. \"And they rock out and they're cool girls and most of them are Asian. They're my heroes. If we can get the Linda Lindas on 'Sesame Street,' I would show them around.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/11/07/m-judi-dench-james-bond-philomena/3467143/", "title": "Bond's 'M' returns to battle M.P.A.A.", "text": "Bryan Alexander\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nJudi Dench has shot a video as her Bond character %27M%27 who died in %27Skyfall%27\n\nDench%27s spy character is calling for an %22important mission%22 to look into the rating for the movie %27Philomena%27\n\n%27Philomena%27 has an %27R%27 rating due to strong language.

Who taught you the word 'bastard?' You can't use that word.’ And I said, ‘Well, you did. You gave me the record!’”\n\nReview:Steven Spielberg doesn't disappoint with his vibrant, revamped 'West Side Story'\n\nMemorizing the songs of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim ignited a lifelong passion that Spielberg has now put on screen, marking the first musical in his legendary career. This new “West Side Story” (now streaming on Disney+ and HBO Max), set in 1957 and starring Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler as young lovers on opposite sides of a gang war, is an expression of “everything I've always wanted to say about something that I've loved since I was a child,” Spielberg says.\n\nAnd when it comes to the revisions in Spielberg's revamp, Sondheim's lyrics ring true: Something's coming, something good. Rita Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film (which won 10 Oscars, including best picture and supporting actress for Moreno), sees a “sociological awareness” among the \"huge and profound\" differences in Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner’s update. The original “was more song and dance and beautiful, extraordinary music. Here you have that plus all this other amazing stuff.”\n\nSpielberg and his cast break down the biggest changes in the new “West Side Story”:\n\nThere’s now a historical reason for the Jets and Sharks to rumble\n\n“West Side Story” has always been about race, as discontent between the rival gangs – the white Jets and Latino Sharks – lead to fights over turf and ultimately, tragedy. Spielberg grounds their beef by bringing in a concrete piece of the past: New York City's '50s-era slum-clearance projects act as a backdrop to the youngsters’ ill will toward each other. The director works in real details of Puerto Ricans evicted from the San Juan Hill neighborhood as “the excuse to build the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts,” he says, with the Jets also being ejected: \"Both gangs were living under the shadow of the wrecking ball.”\n\n'The best there ever was':Jake Gyllenhaal, Barbra Streisand, more react to Stephen Sondheim's death\n\nTony gets a backstory, Maria is 'more mature'\n\nIn Spielberg's take, Tony (Elgort) understands the consequences of violence more than anyone: He's just been released after a year doing time for a violent incident when he was a member of the Jets. “They've all been down hard roads, but he's been to prison,” Spielberg says. Similarly, Kushner’s screenplay fleshes out many roles in complex fashion: For example, Sharks leader Bernardo (David Alvarez) yearns to be a prize fighter, while his sister Maria (Zegler) is “more mature, not such an angelic and virginal Juliet,” the director adds. Moreno reports Kushner gave every actor, including dancers, a backstory for their screen persona: “Pages of where they come from, who they are, how they feel about all kinds of things.\"\n\n'There's no one way to be Latina':Rachel Zegler does stardom her way with 'West Side Story'\n\nRita Moreno adds a new role to the ‘West Side’ canon\n\nAfter playing the fiery Anita in the '61 film, Moreno is drugstore owner Valentina in the new version, a revamped take on the Doc character from the original, who acts as Tony’s boss, landlord and close confidante. Moreno likes that her character is warm but with a “delicious” sense of humor. “I told Steven: ‘Most people see that other Rita who's funny and raucous. You mined the part of me that is very still, that is thoughtful and thinks a great deal. You have given me the chance to be that person when nobody ever does.’\"\n\n'I'm not that color':Rita Moreno pushed back against dark makeup in original 'West Side Story'\n\nTony and Maria change up their wedding vows\n\nThe musical historically had its romantic leads singing to each other while hiding their romance, be it late night on fire escapes or after hours at Maria's work. In the new film, though, Tony and Maria finally go on a proper date, hopping on a subway train for a museum visit. That ride also serves a place where each voices their concerns about potential violence between their factions, though Maria stands up for her community when Tony asks her to come to the Jets’ defense. “My favorite line in that scene is when she just looks at him and says, ‘Do you think it's easier for us?’ It’s this acknowledgement of the difference between the two of them,” Zegler says.\n\nAnd once they get to their destination, Spielberg tweaks the famous \"One Hand, One Heart\" scene where Tony and Maria exchange wedding vows. “I never quite bought the vows as an idea that spontaneously just seems to happen,” he says. “I wanted Maria to be the one to do it, only in Spanish, to the point that Tony is slow in understanding what she's actually saying. And when he finally understands it, he chokes a bit and wonders, ‘Do I play this game or are we getting serious here?’\"\n\nThe Puerto Rican community garners new authenticity\n\nGone are the days of the ’61 film, where white actors (including Natalie Wood, the original Maria) played Hispanic characters and Puerto Rican native Moreno had to wear makeup to darken her skin. The new movie brings respect and focus on the Sharks and their community – all played by Latino actors – as working toward the American dream.\n\nAriana DeBose, the Afro-Latina actress who plays Spielberg's Anita, appreciates how the Puerto Ricans speak Spanish to each other (and without English subtitles) in the new \"West Side Story.\" “It’s so nice to see a film that does not ‘other’ the language,” DeBose says. “In American society, we're like, ‘Well, English is our first language and everything else is secondary,’ when the reality is that it's actually not true in today's world.”\n\n‘America’ comes down from the rooftop and into the streets\n\nIn the original, Anita and Bernardo sing about their opposite feelings about moving to the U.S. on top of their Manhattan apartment building at night. In his version, Spielberg wanted to open up the boisterous musical number “America” to the larger community on the city streets in the daylight and “let that be an anthem for everyone who either loves it here or hates it here.”\n\nIt was great for DeBose, the lead performer in the song, for multiple reasons. “I’m afraid of heights, so I'm really glad we weren't shooting on a rooftop,” she says with a laugh. “At the end of the day, we are a varied community with lots of different lived experiences and opinions in the context of the number, but there is no lack of Latino joy. And that is such a lovely departure from how we are depicted in the entertainment industry sometimes.”\n\nContributing: Patrick Ryan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/middleeast/marvel-israeli-superhero-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Disney's new Israeli superhero film hits a raw nerve with Arabs", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nJerusalem and Abu Dhabi CNN —\n\nThe classic 1981 Marvel comic page shows the giant green Hulk, tears streaming down his face as he yells at Sabra, an Israeli superhero and agent of the country’s Mossad spy agency. The corpse of a young Palestinian boy, killed in an explosion by apparently Arab “terrorists” at his feet.\n\n“Boy died because boy’s people and yours both want to own land! Boy died because you wouldn’t share!” the Hulk says.\n\nA few panels later, the woman in the white and blue costume with a Star of David on her chest kneels next to the boy.\n\n“It has taken the Hulk to make her see this dead Arab boy as a human being,” the comic says. “It has taken a monster to awaken her own sense of humanity.”\n\nSabra, the Israeli superhero, made numerous appearances in Marvel’s comics over the years, starring alongside top icons such as the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man and the X-Men.\n\nMore than forty years after Sabra was introduced, Disney’s Marvel plans to bring her to film in “Captain America: New World Order,” set to be released in 2024. That has created an uproar among those who fear that reviving Sabra’s character would spread offensive stereotypes about Arabs and the dehumanization of Palestinians in cinema.\n\nCritics say many of the Arab characters she interacted with in the comics are shown as misogynistic, antisemitic and violent, and are questioning whether the troubling portrayals of Arabs will play out differently in the film.\n\n“That comic doesn’t suggest anything positive about how this film will play out,” said Yousef Munayyer, a Palestinian-American writer and analyst based in Washington, D.C. “The whole concept” of turning Israeli spies into heroes “is insensitive and disgraceful.”\n\n“The glorification of violence against Palestinians specifically and Arabs and Muslims more broadly in mass media has a long and ugly history in the West and it has remarkable staying power,” he added.\n\nMarvel Comics\n\nWaleed F. Mahdi, author of “Arab Americans in Film: From Hollywood and Egyptian Stereotypes to Self-Representation,” said the “US-Israeli alliance” in cinematic narrative since the 1960s has celebrated American and Israeli law enforcement and intelligence agencies as good forces “committed to deterring violence that has been chiefly linked to Arabs and Muslims.”\n\n“Marvel’s announcement of adapting the comic character of Sabra is a reflection of this legacy,” he told CNN.\n\nA Marvel Studios spokesperson told CNN that “filmmakers are taking a new approach with the character Sabra who was first introduced in the comics over 40 years ago,” adding that characters in Marvel Cinematic Universe “are always freshly imagined for the screen and today’s audience.”\n\nEven some Israelis say Sabra may not be a superhero for our times. Etgar Keret, an Israeli author, scriptwriter and graphic novelist, told CNN that the original Sabra character was created in a different era with a “simple and clear story”.\n\n“This Sabra was created before two [Palestinian] Intifadas [uprisings], it was created before the failing of the Oslo Accords – it was created in a totally different reality and state of mind,” he said. “And now… it’s tough to keep this kind of icon of simplicity.”\n\nThe superhero’s name is a nickname for a Jewish person born in Israel or the occupied territories, and stems from the Hebrew term for the fruit of a prickly pear. It has been in widespread use since the 1930s, before Israel was established.\n\nBut the word is spelled the same way in English as one of two Palestinian communities in Lebanon where a massacre of more than 1,000 Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite civilians was carried out by Lebanese Christian militiamen allied to Israel during the 1982 Lebanon-Israel war – known as the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, named after the places in which it occurred.\n\nIn 1983 the Israeli government released The Kahan Commission of Inquiry into the events that occurred at the refugee camps and found the Israeli army indirectly responsible. It concluded that the army approved the militiamen’s entry into the area and didn’t take appropriate measures to prevent the killings. Ariel Sharon, then defense minister, was forced to resign as a result of the inquiry’s findings.\n\nMarvel’s Sabra character was created before the Sabra and Shatila massacre and has no relation to it, but the announcement to bring her to cinemas just a week before the massacre’s 40th anniversary has touched a raw nerve with Arabs, who accuse the film studio of being insensitive to one of the most tragic events in the history of the Palestinian people.\n\n“It’s not just in the timing or the name but also in the fact that the massacre itself was led by a Mossad-linked [militia] in territory under Israeli military control,” said Munayyer. “Given all of this, it is hard not to conclude that the people at Marvel are either abjectly ignorant about the region, its history and the Palestinian experience, or that they deliberately aimed to kick a people living under apartheid while they were down.”\n\nAlthough Sabra would not be the first time Israel’s intelligence agency has been given the Hollywood treatment, it is the first time the Mossad has been given a supernatural status to the level of a mega, blockbuster superhero. Experts say that’s a public relations win for the agency.\n\nAvner Avraham, a former Mossad officer and founder of the Spy Legends Agency which consults for film and TV shows portraying Israeli spies, said the new portrayal will help a younger generation learn about the Mossad.\n\n“This is the ‘TikTok’ way, the cartoon way to talk to the new generation, and they will learn about the word Mossad,” Avraham said. “It helps the branding. It will add a different audience.”\n\nSuch exposure can even help Mossad recruit sources and assistance in other countries, he added.\n\n“The fact that they decided to take a Mossad agent, a Sabra, and they didn’t take an Egyptian agent or Italian agent, it shows Mossad is a big name,” Avraham said.\n\nUri Fink, an Israeli cartoonist who says he came up with a similar Israeli superhero character first in 1978, fears however that the “progressives” working at Marvel may turn the Israeli agent into a negative character. “They are not well updated, they don’t have an exact description of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” he told CNN.\n\nAvraham echoed that concern, speculating that she may be portrayed as a character that does good for Israel but “bad things to other people.”\n\nCNN’s Michael Schwartz, Abeer Salman and Mohammed Abdelbary contributed to this article\n\nThe digest\n\nArmed woman demanding access to deposits takes hostages at bank in Beirut\n\nA group of people, at least one of whom was armed, took hostages at a bank in central Beirut on Wednesday, demanding access to deposits, state news agency NNA reported. A woman carrying a handgun entered the bank, “doused herself in petrol and threatened to set herself on fire if she was prevented from withdrawing funds to treat her sick sister,” NNA said. She was able to withdraw about $20,000 from her account before leaving the bank. Lebanon’s Directorate of General Security said on Twitter that the woman wasn’t arrested. She said in an interview with a local TV channel that the gun was “a toy” that belonged to her nephew.\n\nBackground: Faced with an economic meltdown, Lebanon implemented strict restrictions on withdrawals from banks in October 2019, preventing people from getting access to their savings.\n\nWhy it matters: This was the second known hostage situation at a bank in the capital in almost a month. Last month, an armed man stormed a Beirut bank and threatened to kill hostages and himself if he wasn’t allowed to withdraw funds from his frozen account. The man said he needed the sum to help pay for his father’s medical expenses. The stand-off ended when the bank gave Hussein part of his savings. Experts have warned that such incidents are likely to be replicated in the heavily armed country.\n\nIran says it has developed new long-range drones for attacks on Israeli cities\n\nIran has developed an advanced long-range drone to target Israeli cities, Brigadier General Kioomars Heidari told state TV on Monday.\n\nBackground: The drone, named Arash-2, “has unique capabilities,” Heidari said, adding that Tehran is “considering this Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) specifically for an attack on Haifa and Tel Aviv.” Separately on Monday, the director of Israel’s Mossad spy service said that Israel would retaliate against Iran if Tehran used force “against Israel or Israelis.”\n\nWhy it matters: As world powers try to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Tehran’s regional foes – namely Israel and Gulf Arab states – have been expressing concern over a potentially emboldened Iran once sanctions are lifted.\n\nIsraeli officer and two Palestinians killed in exchange of fire at West Bank fence\n\nAn Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officer and two Palestinians were killed in an exchange of fire early on Wednesday along the fence that separates the West Bank and Israel, not far from Jenin.\n\nBackground: According to the IDF, the officer killed was Maj. Bar Falah, 30, from Netanya, north of Tel Aviv. The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed the death of two Palestinian men, naming them as Ahmed Ayman Ibrahim Abed, 23, and Abdulrahman Hani Subhi Abed, 22, both from Jenin. The IDF said both were carrying automatic weapons.\n\nWhy it matters: At least 97 Palestinians have been killed in nearly nightly Israeli military raids this year, especially focused on the Jenin area. The Israeli army says most have been militants killed during violent clashes with Israeli soldiers. But uninvolved civilians have also been caught up in the violence. There has been a marked increase in Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West bank, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights watchdog. Israel also says violent attacks against Israelis, particularly soldiers, is also at a high.\n\nAround the region\n\nSaudi authorities in the holy city of Mecca have arrested a man who said he was performing the Islamic pilgrimage for the soul of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Mecca authorities late on Monday tweeted that security forces apprehended a Yemeni resident who had appeared in a video “violating rules” in the holy city’s Great Mosque, where Muslims perform the Hajj pilgrimage, and the lesser pilgrimage called Umrah.\n\nVideos on social media showed the man holding a placard reading, in both English and Arabic, “This Umrah was performed for the soul of Queen Elizabeth II. We ask God to accept her in heaven as one of the righteous people.”\n\nThe Mecca Region tweeted a video of the man with his face and the placard blurred. It didn’t say which rules the man had flouted but said he was referred to public prosecution. Political signs are prohibited during the pilgrimage.\n\nMany responded in anger and called for the man’s arrest, while others mocked him and questioned his motives.

It blows up the record of $208.8 million set in June by Jurassic World.\n\nReview: 'Star Wars' is back in full 'Force'\n\n\"We’re in territory that we’ve never seen in December,\" says Rentrak senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. \"The enormity of this record-breaking weekend cannot be overstated. This is a true watershed event.\n\n\"I don’t have enough adjectives in my arsenal to describe how massive this is.\"\n\nEven more impressive: The Force Awakens annihilated the opening-day and all-time Friday records with $120.5 million, helped by a monster $57 million in Thursday night previews. It breaks the $91.1 million mark set by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2 in 2011, and the new Star Wars is the first movie to surpass $100 million in a single day.\n\nIt also set a new high for highest theater average with $57,500 in 4,134 theaters, and posted an extra $279 million internationally (except for China, where it will open in January) for a $517 million global debut.\n\nBox office awaits show of 'Star Wars' force\n\nThe blockbuster was buoyed by universal raves: Critics heaped praise — a 95% “fresh” rating on RottenTomatoes.com — and audiences gave it an A at CinemaScore. Add to that acclaim Disney's \"pitch-perfect\" marketing, word of mouth through social media, great casting and repeat viewings, and everything came together for an \"unprecedented\" opening, Dergarabedian says. \"If any of those had not been firing properly, you would not be seeing these numbers. The brand can get you really far, but the movie itself had to deliver.\"\n\nA Rentrak audience survey shows that The Force Awakens audience was evenly split in age (with moviegoers older than 25 representing 54%, and 46% of the crowd under 25) and mostly male (66%). Dergarabedian expects that to shift female over time: \"You’re going to have more women coming to see the movie as they hear about what a great and strong character Daisy Ridley\" plays in Rey.\n\nReview: 'Sisters' throws a so-so party\n\nAmong other newcomers this weekend, the animated Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip racked up $14.4 million, and the Tina Fey and Amy Poehler comedy Sisters made $13.4 million. The top five was rounded out by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 with $5.7 million and Creed with $5.1 million.\n\nNext weekend looks fortuitous for Star Wars as well. \"Christmas day is a big moviegoing day and it’s going to be incredibly crowded,\" Dergarabedian says. \"It’ll get to $1 billion without even going into hyperdrive. And then beyond that, because it’s such a good movie, it can scale those heights and get into the $2 billion club.\"\n\nHe adds that 2015 having the two biggest weekends of all time is \"incomprehensible.

The following post discusses plot points and the ending of “Eternals,” so beware if you haven’t seen it yet.\n\nMarvel’s new “Eternals” introduces 10 new characters into its expansive cinematic universe. But that's not all: It tosses out two more as the credits roll, one played by a pop superstar and the other a two-time Oscar winner.\n\nDirector Chloé Zhao’s “Eternals” (in theaters now) centers on a crew of superheroes – including Angelina Jolie’s goddess of war Thena, Gemma Chan’s matter-manipulator Sersi and Kumail Nanjiani’s energy-tossing Kingo – sent to Earth 7,000 years ago by an all-powerful Celestial named Arishem to protect mankind. The Eternals broke up after centuries together and have a reunion in present day only to find out why they’re really here: to prepare for the emergence of a Celestial seeded deep within Earth that will birth a new galaxy yet wipe out the entire planet.\n\n'Eternals':How the new film breaks the Marvel superhero mold as 'a love letter to Earth and humanity'\n\nAfter also finding out that they’ve been unknowingly doing this job throughout the universe for millions of years, our heroes – following the deaths of Ajak (Salma Hayek) and Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and betrayal by Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sprite (Lia McHugh) – work in unison to keep the Celestial from rising out of the ocean and save Earth in the process. A ticked-off Arishem absconds with Sersi, Kingo and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), telling the trio that he will examine their memories to determine if humanity should be saved and promises, “I will return in judgment.”\n\nIt's a pretty epic finale that's arguably outdone by two end-credits scenes, which call up a couple of characters from the comic books to add intrigue to the MCU’s future.\n\nReview:Marvel's overstuffed 'Eternals' is a star-studded exercise in superhero excess\n\nHarry Styles makes his Marvel debut as Eros\n\nThe first end-credits scene catches up with Thena, deaf speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) and mind-control master Druig (Barry Keoghan), who are on the spaceship Domo headed to tell other Eternals how they’re being used by the Celestials. It’s been weeks since they heard from their friends, so Thena figures Arishem’s involved.\n\nAll of a sudden, a drunk gnome-like dude pops up in the hallway and introduces himself as Pip the Troll (Patton Oswalt). He then proclaims the entrance of the cool and smooth Eternal known as Eros, a royal prince and brother of Thanos from the planet Titan, played by Styles. “Your friends are in big trouble and I know where to find them,” Eros tells them after flirting with Thena a bit.\n\nZhao actually was the one who pitched Marvel on using Eros (aka Starfox in the comics) and Pip in a scene hinting at one direction where a sequel could go. “They remind me of Han and Chewbacca (from 'Star Wars'): space outlaws,” she says. “When we meet Eros, what effect did he have on Thanos and how did he get out of Arishem's grip? Clearly, he's flying free right now. That story interests me greatly.”\n\nThe director had seen Styles' acting debut in 2017's \"Dunkirk\" and “kept tabs on him,” thinking he was an “interesting” actor who could “bring a little bit of themselves into this character.”\n\nNanjiani wasn't in the scene with Styles but the British singer visited the set and hung out with “Eternals” actors at a holiday party thrown by Hayek. “Obviously, he's extremely charming and very, very handsome and that hair – I mean, that hair – but he's just like a normal, very regular guy,” Nanjiani says. “I was a little bit surprised that they picked a massive pop star to be a major part of the MCU going forward, but once I met him and then I saw him onscreen, I understood.”\n\nCome for Black Knight, stay for Blade\n\nSersi’s boyfriend Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) doesn’t get much screen time in \"Eternals\" but at the end, he’s about to tell Sersi something important about his lineage (“It turns out my family history is complicated”) when Arishem arrives and captures Sersi.\n\nThe truth bomb Dane was about to drop probably has something to do with his scene after the credits finish, where he's opening an ancient box with the Ebony Blade inside and a cryptic saying written on it: “Death is my reward.” In the comics, Dane wields the magical sword with a blood curse that turns him into the Avenger called Black Knight. In “Eternals,” though, he’s nervous about even touching it, as it hisses strangely in his office. “I’m sorry, I have to try,” Dane says, reaching out as another voice offscreen warns, “Sure you’re ready for that, Mr. Whitman?”\n\nBefore signing on to “Eternals,” Harington “read up on some of the stuff on the internet” about Black Knight and “that was part of my decision-making process in coming into this,” the “Game of Thrones” star says.\n\nZhao loved Black Knight's Arthurian vibe but also the blood curse aspect. “It's a very interesting aspect of a superhero, the addiction toward power and strength. We've seen that explored in the MCU before, but for Black Knight it's very physical,” she says. \"How do you deal with the responsibility that comes with addiction?”\n\nAnd that unseen figure? None other than Mahershala Ali making his first MCU appearance as Blade, the vampire hunter played by Wesley Snipes for three movies in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s. Marvel announced a new \"Blade\" movie starring Ali was in development at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nZhao points out that Blade’s story also deals with a blood curse – since he’s half-vampire and immortal. “I love Blade, he's one of my favorite superheroes so it's really exciting that the MCU is bringing him back.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/08/18/company--r2-d2-ana-airline-adds-more-star-wars-boeing-jets/31899049/", "title": "Company for R2-D2?

Now two more Star Wars-themed planes are joining the fleet of Japan's largest carrier.\n\nOne of the designs will feature BB-8, a new character to be introduced in the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. BB-8's likeness will grace one of ANA's Boeing 777-300ER widebody planes. The other new design – on a Boeing 767-300 – will feature both BB-8 and R2-D2.\n\nThe out-of-this-world aircraft liveries are part of a five-year promotional deal between ANA and The Walt Disney Company, which now holds the rights for the Star Wars franchise. The latest Star Wars movie is set for a December release.\n\nIn addition to the unique paint schemes, ANA's \"Star Wars Project\" also calls for movie-inspired images to be added to headrest covers, paper napkins and cups onboard the Star Wars aircraft.\n\nANA also will include all six of the currently released Star Wars films in its in-flight entertainment options on international routes. ANA says that marks the first time that any of the Star Wars movies have been included as part of an in-flight entertainment system.\n\n\"We're thrilled to unveil the designs of our new Star Wars themed planes, and I'm sure fans across the world will love the look,\" ANA CEO Osamu Shinobe says in a statement. \"At ANA we pride ourselves on offering the best possible flight experience, from the ANA Star Wars Project and our extensive in-flight entertainment options, to our peerless, award-winning in-flight service, dining options created by Michelin-starred chefs and wines chosen by our discerning sommeliers.

The R2-D2 aircraft is set to fly international routes, with its debut expected to come Oct. 18 as ANA Flight 116 between Tokyo and Vancouver. ANA says the jet will then fly between Japan and \"other cities in ANA's robust international network including the U.S. (Seattle and San Jose), Europe (Munich, Paris and Brussels), Australia (Sydney), China (Beijing), and Indonesia (Jakarta).\"\n\nThen, in November, the Star Wars-themed Boeing 767 will debut on intra-Japan routes. The BB-8 jet is expected to make its first flight in March 2016, \"serving international routes principally between Japan and North America,\" according to ANA.\n\nANA says customers will be able to see future route plans for the Star Wars planes on its website.\n\nTWITTER:You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/03/24/hyrule-warriors-legends-3ds-review-technobubble/82190014/", "title": "Pocket fighter: Hyrule Warriors Legends 3DS review | Technobubble", "text": "Jason Hidalgo\n\njhidalgo@rgj.com\n\nTechnobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek.

After gracing the Wii U home console, “Hyrule Warriors” gets another shot at hot-and-heavy action posterity with the release of “Hyrule Warriors Legends” on Nintendo’s handheld system.\n\nIn my review of the game’s older brother on the Wii U about a year and a half ago, I described it as “deep-fried caviar,” thanks to its melding of the highly regarded Zelda series with the more popcorn-flick approach of Dynasty Warriors. At the same time, I’m admittedly a fan of both series so it was a bit like having my cake and eating it, too. Even Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said he would like to adopt Hyrule Warriors' concept of large roaming bosses in the upcoming Wii U Zelda game when I interviewed him and Koei Tecmo’s Yosuke Hayashi about Hyrule Warriors back in 2014.\n\nAlthough it would be easy to just refer folks to my original Hyrule Warriors review for the Wii U, the 3DS version actually introduces a few tweaks that make it worth another look. For the most part, the changes are a positive addition that improve the experience, although fitting the game into a handheld console comes with its own challenges as well.\n\nDeep fried caviar: Hyrule Warriors review | Technobubble\n\nTechnobubble Talk: Hyrule Warriors devs talk Zelda\n\nUnmasked: Zelda Majora's Mask 3D review | Technobubble\n\nPlaying on a New Nintendo 3DS system, I was surprised at how well the game retains the over-the-top action and large enemy numbers seen in the original title. It wasn’t long before I was mowing down enemy peons like a boss while also taking down enemy commanders and bosses the same way I did with the Wii U. Graphically, the cut scenes still look nice but there’s an obvious loss in graphical quality for the actual game compared to its console brother. I also noticed an effect almost akin to cel shading where you have a black line around the characters’ edges, which was likely added to make it easier to distinguish them. Turn the 3D effect on, however, and the visuals look much better compared to having 3D off. The excellent eye tracking of the New 3DS also means a consistently clearer picture even if you don’t have the steadiest of hands.\n\nOne much welcome addition to the gameplay is the ability to not only easily swap between characters on the field but also direct the playable characters you aren’t using to different areas or objective points. This makes tackling various missions and goals within the map a much smoother experience compared to all the running around you have to do in the Wii U version. This gameplay change alone pretty much makes Hyrule Warriors Legends the definitive version of the game, even with the smaller screen and cramped handheld controls.\n\nThe game also adds five new characters that should please fans. These include three Wind Waker characters in Toon Link, King Daphnes and heroine Tetra. Lovers of Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, meanwhile, will love the addition of Skull Kid while fans of the Legend of Zelda in general will appreciate Linkle joining the cast of more than 20 characters as well. These five characters bring their own style to the game, helping freshen things up for folks who played the original. Rounding out the list of new key features is the ability to raise your own fairy to get different perks or buffs in battle, as well as an Ocarina for fast warping and a hammer that can be best described as, uh, “smashing.\"\n\nAll that being said, the game suffers from one key drawback that sets back its overall score despite its great additions. That would be its performance on older 3DS systems or the 2DS, which don’t have the same processing punch that the New 3DS handhelds do. I'm not sure if they should have just made this a New 3DS exclusive like Xenoblade Chronicles 3D but the impact on frame rates is enough of a performance downgrade that it can hamper enjoyment of the game for folks using one of the older systems. I also wish the new changes make it to my older Wii U version as well. Hey, maybe they’re saving it for a re-release on the upcoming NX?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nHyrule Warriors Legends is a notable refresh of the Wii U original that adds new characters and greatly improves gameplay thanks to the addition of character switching and the ability to direct allies in the battlefield. Owners of older 3DS systems and the 2DS likely will be disappointed by the drop in performance. If you own a New 3DS, however, and loved the Wii U game, this portable version is a worthy addition to your handheld library.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/24"}]}

The Justice Department said it will implement a process to provide certificates of pardon in the coming days. A call to all states: The president urged all governors to take the same action with state marijuana offenses, which account for the vast majority of pot convictions. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have already legalized the recreational use of marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and 37 states have legalized marijuana for medical use.\n\nThe president urged all governors to take the same action with state marijuana offenses, which account for the vast majority of pot convictions. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have already legalized the recreational use of marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and 37 states have legalized marijuana for medical use. Schedule 1 examined: Biden asked Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Attorney General Merrick Garland to \"expeditiously\" review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. As a Schedule 1 drug, marijuana is currently in the same classification as heroin and LSD, Biden said, \"and even higher than the classification of fentanyl and methamphetamine – the drugs that are driving our overdose epidemic.\"\n\nMore:President Joe Biden's proclamation on granting pardon for the offense of simple possession of marijuana\n\nA historic move\n\nBiden's actions are, quite simply, massive.\n\nIt's the most significant steps a U.S. president has taken to loosen federal marijuana laws, following the footsteps of increasingly more states that have moved to decriminalize marijuana in recent years.\n\nSince 1965, nearly 29 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana-related violations, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\n\nBlack people are 3.64 times more likely than white people to be arrested for pot possessions, according to the ACLU.\n\nMore:In what states is weed legal? Here is the list.\n\nMarijuana remains fully illegal in several states – including Idaho, South Carolina, Kansas, and Idaho and Nebraska – while only CBD oil is allowed in others: Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nCriminal records for marijuana possession produce barriers for individuals to obtain employment, housing and educational. Some states ban people with prior drug convictions from participating in federal food stamp and welfare programs.\n\nMany are asking how this will impact voting rights of previously convicted felons.\n\nMore:Marijuana is being legalized in parts of US. That's not helping everyone with convictions.\n\nWho isn't being pardoned?\n\nSo, who isn't benefiting from the president's action?\n\nPeople convicted of simple possession of marijuana at the state level\n\nPeople who were not in the U.S. legally at the time of their offense.\n\nPeople with federal convictions for other marijuana-related crimes like trafficking\n\nExact numbers in those three categories are not immediately available. But the state-prosecuted offenders represent \"the vast majority\" of folks who have been convicted of simple possession which is why the president is urging governors to follow his action.\n\nThe midterm calculation\n\nThe political backdrop with Biden's announcement can't be ignored either, and there was almost certainly an election calculus.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden vowed as president he would decriminalize marijuana and expunge all prior cannabis use convictions.\n\nBiden's announcement comes a month before the midterm election. Momentum that Democrats captured over the summer has, according to several polls, started to subside as gas prices rise again.\n\nMore:Biden pardons three felons, commutes sentences of 75 others, in first use of clemency powers\n\nThe president's move could energize a wavering Democratic base, particularly among young, Black and Latino voters – voting blocs critical for Democrats to hold on to power in Congress.\n\nSupport for legalizing marijuana is at an all-time high of 68% nationally, according to Gallup, including 71% of independent voters.\n\nLast month, Biden delivered another timely announcement politically when he used executive authority to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\nBiden said his steps seek to end a \"failed approach\" to marijuana that has incarcerated people for conduct many states no longer prohibit. \"Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana,\" Biden said in a statement. \"It’s time that we right these wrongs.\"\n\nDerrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, applauded Biden for \"correcting unequal treatment,\" pointing to the racial disparity in drug arrests. \"Today marks another significant step in addressing the systemic racism within the criminal justice system,\" he said. \"Vote, vote, vote. We can continue to make a difference.”\n\nSome Democratic candidates quickly embraced the move. Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman said, \"This is a BFD and a massive step towards justice. \"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the president's actions as \"the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice.\" Pelosi endorsed exploring whether to reclassify marijuana , calling it a \"necessary step\" to not \"repeat the grave mistake of mass incarceration.\"\n\nMost Republicans did not immediately weigh in on Biden's announcement. Recent polling from the Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank and polling firm found 70% of Americans – including even 58% of Republicans – either support or somewhat support the legalization of marijuana for adults at least 21 years old.\n\nErik Altieri, executive director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, called the president's actions \"long overdue.\" Moving forward, he called on the Biden administration to work with Congress to recategorize cannabis. \"Congress should be inspired by the Administration’s actions today to act quickly and send legislation to the President’s desk that would help close this dark chapter of our history,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/politics/biden-marijuana-possession-pardons/index.html", "title": "Here's who is not eligible for Biden's marijuana pardon | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he’s pardoning individuals charged with simple marijuana possession on a federal level, but his decision does not affect broad groups of Americans and non-citizens charged with the crime.\n\nThere’s historical precedent for mass application of the presidential pardon power, but the sheer size of Biden’s pardon list stands out among most recent predecessors. The White House estimates “6,500 people with prior federal convictions” and “thousands of such convictions under (Washington, DC) law could benefit from this relief.”\n\nWhile Biden is issuing pardons for federal charges of simple marijuana possession, his move on Thursday did not decriminalize the drug and it remains a federal crime to possess small amounts of marijuana on federal land. Biden did announce an expedited review of how marijuana is scheduled under federal law – a move that could change how the drug is regulated in the United States and could help guide criminal laws.\n\nIn a video announcing his executive actions, Biden said that “no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana.”\n\n“It’s legal in many states, and criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,” he continued. “And that’s before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences. While White and Black and Brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and Brown people are arrested, prosecuted and convicted at disproportionate rates.”\n\nBut despite those words, there is still a broad set people who will not see immediate relief from Biden’s recent actions – some who he could have pardoned and some who he doesn’t have the power to pardon.\n\nIndividuals facing state marijuana charges\n\nAmong those who Biden does not have power to pardon are thousands of individuals who have faced state charges for simple marijuana possession.\n\nWhile Americans’ attitudes about marijuana consumption are changing – smoking weed is becoming more popular than smoking tobacco, and 19 states, two US territories, and DC have legalized small amounts of marijuana – there are still laws in most states that criminalize possessing small amounts of marijuana.\n\nThe full scope of individuals who could be pardoned as a result of state clemency for simple marijuana possession is unclear, but available law enforcement data analyzed by the American Civil Liberties Union found that in 2018, for example, there were almost 700,000 marijuana arrests, which accounted for more than 43% of all reported drug arrests. Not all drug arrests, however, lead to charges nor are they all categorized as simple marijuana possession.\n\nThe President’s presidential pardon power is limited to federal criminal cases and does not extend to state criminal charges. As part of his moves Thursday, Biden called on governors to issue similar pardons to those with state marijuana offense convictions.\n\nUnlawfully present non-citizens charged federally with simple possession of marijuana\n\nBiden’s presidential proclamation states that his pardon “does not apply to individuals who were non-citizens not lawfully present in the United States at the time of their offense.”\n\nThis suggests that undocumented immigrants will not be pardoned for existing federal charges for simple marijuana possession.\n\nBut a senior administration official on Thursday noted that as a result of Biden’s proclamation, “anyone who has committed that offense could not be prosecuted federally, at this point, based on that conduct.”\n\nThe official did not make a distinction between citizens and non-citizens.\n\nData from the US Sentencing Commission indicates that some 72% of federal offenders in a case of marijuana possession were, on average, non-citizens between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2021. But it’s not clear how many non-citizens count as “lawfully” or “unlawfully” present in the country.\n\nMatt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration attorney who also teaches immigration policy at Northeastern University, told CNN that the decision to not include non-citizens who were not lawfully present could have dire consequences for some people.\n\n“If you’re in deportation proceedings or applying for a visa or applying green card, and you’re charged for possession, you will be denied. And you won’t be eligible for a waiver,” he said.\n\nHe added, “You could be denied a green card and you would be denied for life.”\n\nIndividuals charged in the future with federal simple marijuana possession offenses\n\nThe Department of Justice says that federal marijuana possession offenses that occur after October 6, 2022 – the date of the presidential proclamation – will not protect individuals from being charged down the road.\n\n“The proclamation pardons only those offenses occurring on or before October 6, 2022. It does not have any effect on marijuana possession offenses occurring after October 6, 2022,” DOJ says.\n\nHowever, the pardon does apply to pending federal simple marijuana possession charges, including those where conviction has not been obtained by October 6.\n\nIndividuals charged with other offenses\n\nIn a statement about his presidential proclamation, Biden emphasized that “even as federal and state regulation of marijuana changes, important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales should stay in place.”\n\nWhile Biden’s pardons will impact thousands who face simple possession charges, the act of clemency will not apply to all types of federal marijuana offenses.\n\n“Conspiracy, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, and other charges involving marijuana are not pardoned by the proclamation,” the Justice Department says.\n\nThe DOJ also says the pardon does not apply to individuals who were convicted of possessing multiple different controlled substances in the same offense – including a charge related to possessing marijuana and another controlled substance in a single offense.\n\n“For example, if you were convicted of possessing marijuana and cocaine in a single offense, you do not qualify for pardon under the terms of President Biden’s proclamation,” the Justice Department explained. “If you were convicted of one count of simple possession of marijuana and a second count of possession of cocaine, President Biden’s proclamation applies only to the simple possession of marijuana count, not the possession of cocaine count.”\n\nThe move also is not expected to remove any individuals from prison.\n\nThe administration official speaking to reporters on Thursday said that “there are no individuals currently in federal prison solely for simple possession of marijuana.”\n\nIndividuals seeking additional guidance regarding federal pardon eligibility and procedures should visit https://www.justice.gov/pardon for more information.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the proportion of non-citizens who were federal offenders in marijuana possession cases.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Aditi Sangal", "Maegan Vazquez", "Aditi Sangal"], "publish_date": "2022/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2022/10/06/biden-pardons-marijuana-possession-convictions-leadership-legalization/8199143001/", "title": "Biden's marijuana pardon announcement is step toward ...", "text": "President Biden pardoned federal convictions for possessing marijuana.\n\nA majority of states have laws that permit marijuana in certain circumstances.\n\nBiden's action on Thursday is a step in the right direction.\n\nNo one should go to jail or be targeted by police for a nonviolent marijuana-related crime when its use is legal in most states.\n\nThat's what USA TODAY Opinion said in an August editorial, one of four published as part of a series urging reform of the nation's marijuana laws.\n\nIt's such a simple conclusion, one that has evolved after years of marijuana policy reform and practice.

The president mentioned the disparate impact of marijuana laws, that Black and brown people are arrested, prosecuted and convicted at greater rates than white people, even though marijuana usage rates are similar.\n\nMarijuana pardons:In historic move, Biden pardons those with federal convictions for possessing marijuana\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson praised the president's marijuana initiative as a way to help correct unequal racial treatment in the justice system, pointing to the importance of voting for Biden in 2020.\n\n“Today marks another significant step in addressing the systemic racism within the criminal justice system,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our collective vote in 2020 is resulting in concrete progress. Vote, vote, vote. We can continue to make a difference.”\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said Biden's action is the latest promise kept to Black voters, \"the heart and soul of the Democratic Party\" that was instrumental in his victories in the 2020 primaries and general election.\n\n\"This president has been very intentional and focused on making sure that communities that have been left out, left behind for a very long time, finally get what John Lewis would oftentimes say to me, 'Oceans of justice, and rivers of fairness,'\" he said.\n\nThe marijuana reform could provide incentive for some supporters to get out and vote when they otherwise might have stayed home, Seawright said.\n\nHistoric move:'Right these wrongs': Inside Biden's history-making moves on marijuana\n\nThat also could be a significant factor with younger voters, who tend to vote less often compared with older people, especially in non-presidential years.\n\nMarijuana legalization is \"especially popular with young voters across the country and in Colorado,\" one of the first two states to vote to legalize recreational marijuana use, said Chris Griswold, a Denver-based principal with Hilltop Public Solutions, which consults with Democratic campaigns and on various Democratic-aligned priorities, such as climate issues. \"This ultimately has the impact of helping to get young voters to turn out this November.\"\n\nBiden's move could help Democrats in some states, such as Pennsylvania, a swing state with close races where marijuana legalization is an ongoing debate, said Mindy Romero, director of the University of Southern California Center for Inclusive Democracy. One potential downside, she added, is that Republicans could use the president's initiative to support their argument that Democrats are soft on crime.\n\n\"Anything that can be used for political advantage will be done by either side, and I think Republicans certainly will use this in their campaigns,\" she said.\n\nVotes count:Abortion, slavery and marijuana: Here are the ballot questions to watch in 2022 midterms\n\nIt's so close to the November election that Biden's marijuana announcement may not have that big of an effect now, but it could play a role in the 2024 campaign, she said.\n\n\"Presidential elections are higher turnout. They're more diverse. There's a long runway\" to 2024, she said. \"If this was the start of a series of actions by the administration that could generate support for the 2024 presidential campaign – and for other Democrats as well – then maybe we should be thinking about this as a long game.\"\n\nMatt Grodsky, a former Arizona Democratic party spokesman and vice president of the Matters of State Strategies political consulting firm, said marijuana reform will appeal to Democratic voters and probably independents but it's \"highly unlikely to move the needle in the midterms\" in Arizona, the swing state where he is based. Arizona voters approved adult personal use of marijuana in 2020.\n\n\"Given the concerns about inflation, abortion and reproductive health care rights, voting rights and what it's going to mean if we have these America First candidates take control in November, those are the dominating issues in people's minds,\" he said.\n\nGrodsky did see one immediate and very short-term benefit for the president. \"All the reporters are asking about this and not about gas prices,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/06/biden-proclamation-pardoning-marijuana/8199567001/", "title": "President Joe Biden's proclamation on granting pardon for the ...", "text": "President Joe Biden issued a proclamation on Thursday to pardon people convicted of simple marijuana possession.\n\nThe president also is urging governors to do the same in states, as most convictions happen at a state level.\n\n\"Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana,\" Biden said in a video announcement. \"It’s time that we right these wrongs.\"\n\nBiden is taking this action as part of a step to fulfil a campaign promise, given that the efforts in Congress to address the issue have stalled, White House officials said.\n\nJoe Biden proclamation on pardoning marijuana:In historic move, Biden pardons those with federal convictions for possessing marijuana\n\nThe proclamation\n\nActing pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Joseph R.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 7th of October, 2022. Today, Biden's marijuana pardons, plus how some seniors are falling into poverty, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nPresident Joe Biden said yesterday that the risk of nuclear armageddon is at the highest level since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Russian officials have mentioned the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons after massive setbacks in the country's invasion of Ukraine. The death toll is now 36 in the deadliest shooting rampage in the history of Thailand. At least 24 of those killed were children. And Prince Harry is joining in on a lawsuit against the publisher of British tabloid, the Daily Mail. He, Elton John and others say associated newspapers have illegally breached celebrities' privacy by bugging their cars and homes and more.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden, yesterday, announced that he's pardoning those with federal convictions of simple marijuana possession. The historic move could help some 6,500 people. And while the majority of convictions happen at the state level, Biden is also urging governors to pardon those offenders. In his video announcement, the president said too many lives had been upended, and that policy has disproportionately affected Black and brown people.\n\nPresident Biden:\n\nAs I said when I ran for president, no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. It's already legal in many states. And criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment, to housing and educational opportunities. And that's before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences. While white, Black and brown people use marijuana and similar rates, Black and brown people are arrested, prosecuted and convicted at disproportionately higher rates.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBiden is also asking the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to review how the drug should be scheduled under federal law. The Justice Department will begin issuing pardon certificates in the coming days. And pardons will apply to those under the District of Columbia's drug laws, which cover thousands more people. They do not apply, though, to anyone who, at the time of their offense, was not in the country legally. The president's pardon also blocks future federal prosecutions for simple marijuana possession.\n\nMarijuana is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. The classification meant for the most dangerous substances. It's used mostly to classify drugs with no currently accepted medical use and high potential for abuse. Other Schedule I drugs include heroin and LSD, while fentanyl and methamphetamines are Schedule II. Congress, over the years, has created dozens of mandatory minimum sentencing laws that are often especially serious for repeat offenders, including even life without parole behind bars for a third offense in some cases.\n\nMore than 540,000 people were arrested for marijuana-related offenses in 2019, according to the FBI. But mostly for state offenses. In April, the House voted to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, but the Senate has not considered the legislation.\n\n♦\n\nA million more seniors fell into poverty last year, the only age group to see a rise. And analysts say it's only going to get worse as inflation takes off. Money reporter Medora Lee and producer PJ Elliott have more.\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo this is really interesting. A lot of people talked about how the child poverty rate had dropped to a record-low 5.2% last year. But not a lot of people talked about the seniors. That poverty rate actually rose to 10.3% from 8.9% in 2020. And that's the highest level since 2002. That's about a million more seniors, who are aged 65 years and older who fell into poverty during that time. And that is pretty alarming because that's the only age group that saw an increase in poverty last year.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nWell, why did it jump?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nI think a lot of it has to do in part with inflation. They get their senior citizen Social Security benefits adjusted for inflation, but inflation has just been rampant and outpacing their increases.\n\nAlso, when Social Security was first started, it was based on the idea that this Social Security was going to supplement retirement savings and pension benefits. And you can see now that pensions are becoming a thing of the past. People are just having more 401(k)s, and so that hasn't really kept up. So a lot of seniors have fallen behind.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nIs there anything that can be done to help them out?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSome people have suggested that in the short-term, they can increase some more of their benefits by increasing the eligibility for SNAP or what's also known as food stamps for seniors, temporarily, or expand rental subsidies. Seniors spend a lot on housing, so that would help. And so maybe some extra Medicare help because they also spend a lot on healthcare.\n\nIn the longer-term, they might want to start looking at adjusting the measure that they use to determine their increase in Social Security benefits. Right now, it's based on a subset of the Consumer Price Index. The problem with that is that it isn't exactly reflective of what seniors spend on. They use the subset, and it reflects what everybody spends on.\n\nAnd so maybe they want to try to look at a more tailored subset of the Consumer Price Index. And people are suggesting a Consumer Price Index for the elderly that has a bigger weighting for the things that they actually spend on, things like housing and healthcare. And then there's also other organizations that have come up with the Elderly Care Index. And so some people have been advocating for that. But that's something that maybe the government needs to look at.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor Medora's full story, you can find a link in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nA suspect is in custody after stabbing and killing two people and injuring six others on the Las Vegas Strip. Police said victims were a combination of locals and tourists and three were in critical condition. Police said the attacker was a man in his 30s who does not appear to be a Vegas resident. It's not clear what sparked the attack, though it appears unprovoked. Witness, Ty Tucker.\n\nTy Tucker:\n\nI just remember seeing a guy drop, and then being like, \"Okay, that's bad.\" And I don't know if he got... I literally thought he got shot first, but I didn't hear a shot or anything. And I hear the screaming, and then I just couldn't keep track of what was happening. It was so fast.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPolice say the suspect was taken into custody within minutes by security guards in the area. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, a local government agency in charge of promotion said in a statement, \"All indications are that this was an isolated incident perpetrated by one individual.\"\n\n♦\n\nA total of five college football coaches have been fired so far this season. But despite the turnover and the millions of dollars it costs the schools to buy out the contracts, coaches are guaranteed more money than ever. PJ Elliott spoke with sports reporter, Brent Schrotenboer to find out why colleges are willing to give out these types of contracts.\n\nBrent Schrotenboer:\n\nWell, the biggest reason is coaches' compensation keeps going up because of the market. These schools are getting more money than ever in revenue from their TV and media rights contracts. They've got more money to spend on their cash cow, which is football. And because the price of labor, which is players, is capped at the cost of attendance for college, by rule, that leaves a lot of money to spend for these schools on coaches. And the market just keeps going up, and there's pressure to keep up with the competition. And therefore, the market just keeps spiraling up. And every school always thinks if they just pay enough money and get the right coach they can, one day, be the next Alabama.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nIs there any sense from these athletic directors and university presidents that it's not a great look when it comes to the bigger picture? That while the money may be coming from two different pots, these schools are spending millions of dollars to fire these coaches, all while students are paying tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition to attend these schools? Or are they just oblivious and don't care about the aesthetics of it?\n\nBrent Schrotenboer:\n\nWell, they are sensitive to the perception that they're wasting all this money. And so as you mentioned, every time a coach gets fired and has owed $10 million or $15 million in a buyout, the school always says, \"Well, it's not coming from student money, it's not coming from taxpayer money.\"\n\nWell, money is fungible. At these public schools, they do rely on public funds. And in one sense, they do have a lot of money. And I think that's why there's been such an uprising to make sure that the players get more money. In recent years, there's been a revolution in that regard, I think, because of the aesthetics or the perception of it that everybody is making so much money including, and especially, the coaches that we've got to start paying the players, too, or let them have some of it.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nBrent, the last question I have for you is about the school boosters. How much of a factor do they play when it comes to these coaches and their contracts?\n\nBrent Schrotenboer:\n\nThey're a big factor. I talked to one near the end of last year where Michigan State was having a good season. They started the season 8-0, they finished 11-2. Last November, they gave their coach, Mel Tucker, a 10-year, $95 million contract. One reason they were able to afford that was because of boosters.\n\nI talked to one of those boosters, and I asked him about the risk involved like, \"Don't you see a risk?\" And he essentially said, \"There's no risk at all. We're not hiring somebody to go 10 and two every year; we're hiring a leader of men.\" And he said, \"I know this guy and I'm confident it'll work out and that there are risks.\" He acknowledged there are risks involved, but there's a risk in everything. \"If you worry about every single risk,\" he said, \"You're not going to get very far in life.\" And this is a successful businessman; he's a billionaire, I think. His name is Matt Ishbia, and he's a former player at Michigan State in basketball. So it's not like he's stupid or naive by any stretch. He knows sports and he knows business, but that was his approach and reason for committing to help pay for some of that contract.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Major League Baseball postseason is here. First up is the Wild Card round beginning today, and there's a new format. USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner explains.\n\nSteve Gardner:\n\nYeah. MLB has a new Wild Card format for this year. Gone is the one game and done situation. It's now best of three. And this year and going forward, those Wild Card games will all be played at the higher-seeded teams' home park. So there's a definite advantage to finishing higher in the standings. It's going to make for a test of depth. And the team with the best depth over those three games will probably prevail. The series I'm looking forward to the most is probably the Mets hosting the San Diego Padres. Two teams who've been all in on making it to the playoffs and going deep with their moves this season. And one of them is going to have an early exit.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIn addition to that, Padres-Mets series and the No. 4 vs. 5 series in the National League, the Philadelphia Phillies will take on the St. Louis Cardinals in the 3 vs. 6 series. The winner of that series gets the defending champion Atlanta Braves in the next round, while the other series winner will play the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMeanwhile, over in the American League, the No. 3 Cleveland Guardians will play No. 6 Tampa Bay Rays. And the No. 4 Toronto Blue Jays take on the 5 seed Seattle Mariners, back in the playoffs for the first time since 2001. Action begins today at noon Eastern Time with games all weekend on the ESPN networks.

The revelation was a boon for publicly traded cannabis companies.\n\nViral social media posts also claimed it was a moneymaker for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The claims linked her to Canopy Growth, a company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker WEED, which saw its stock price soar the day of Biden's announcement.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi bought 10,000,000 shares of $WEED stock 4 days before it exploded higher,” one Facebook user wrote in an Oct. 8 post. “Weed stocks skyrocketed on Thursday, and nancy (sic) Pelosi turned $80m investment into a $120m investment.”\n\nThe viral post questions the legality of such an investment, suggesting it was insider trading.\n\nAnother version of the claim was shared more than 200 times on Facebook before being deleted by the user. That iteration also included an image of a purported tweet claiming Reuters reported the investment and was shared more than 4,000 times by Monday.\n\nBut the claim is false.\n\nThere is no evidence Pelosi bought stock in a cannabis company days before Biden announced the federal marijuana possession pardons. Pelosi’s spokesperson said no such transaction happened. Such a purchase has not been reported by Reuters or any other reputable media outlet.\n\nAnd the numbers in the post don't line up with where that stock traded before and after Biden's announcement.\n\nFollow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the claim.\n\nPelosi's spokesperson, records undermine claim\n\nA spokesperson for Pelosi directly refuted the claim.\n\n“This is fake. No such transaction has been made,” Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, wrote in an email.\n\nThe math presented in the post also doesn't add up.\n\nThe claim references a stock with the ticker symbol WEED. In the U.S. that ID is used by an exchange-traded fund that has only 175,000 shares, so it wouldn't be possible to buy 10 million shares as the claim asserts.\n\nThe figures in the post also make little sense if examined based on the Canadian company that uses the WEED ticker, Canopy Growth.\n\nTo make an $80 million investment for 10 million shares, Pelosi would have had to pay $8 Canadian dollars per share, which is about double the market price four days before the Oct. 6 announcement, the date in the claim. (Stock markets were not open that day, but pre-market and post-market trades usually fall near the previous market day's close and the next market day's open. WEED closed at $3.75 on Sept. 30 and opened at $3.79 on Oct. 3.)\n\nTo recoup $120 million, 10 million shares would have to be sold for $12 each. The high for Canopy Growth shares on the Toronto exchange on Oct. 6 was $5.26, and it closed at $5.16. That means Pelosi would have had to sell them for more than twice market price.\n\nThe claim makes even less sense if considered using U.S. dollars, as that would mean Pelosi both bought and sold the stock at roughly three times the market price.\n\nPurchases of stocks must be documented in periodic transaction reports that lawmakers file with the clerk of the House of Representatives. Online records do not show a report that could include a stock purchase on Oct. 2, although Pelosi would still have more than a month to file it.\n\nOwning and trading stocks is legal for members of Congress, although some lawmakers in both parties have proposed a ban because of the potential to use non-public information to get an upper hand.\n\nBiden’s pardons only apply to convictions on federal charges of simple marijuana possession, directly affecting about 6,500 people. In the announcement, Biden encouraged governors to follow suit with state convictions, which represent the vast majority of marijuana-related cases.

Nearly 7,000 were federally charged with those offenses in 2012.\n\nAcross the nation, about 500,000 people were arrested on cannabis-related offenses in 2019. Most of those charges were for state offenses, the FBI said.\n\nMarijuana accounted for more than 1 in 3 possession arrests that same year, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts' public safety performance project. In 2009, that number was more than 1 in 2.\n\nNineteen states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana and 31 states have decriminalized the substance. Racial disparities in drug arrests persist even as the legal marijuana industry remains dominated by white entrepreneurs.\n\nNearly 70% of Americans support legalizing marijuana, according to Gallup. More than 80% of Democrats support legalizing the substance, while Republicans were nearly evenly split on the question.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers criticized the president's plan. A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said: \"The governor of Texas can only pardon individuals who have been through the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles system with a recommendation for pardon.\"\n\nOpinion:America is ready for marijuana reform. Biden's pardon announcement proves it.\n\nNatalie Papillion, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project, praised Biden for first focusing on repairing the harms of the war on drugs as opposed to other aspects of marijuana legalization but said there is work to ensure that more people get justice.\n\n\"Before we talk about how much money we can really make, services and so forth and so on, we need to talk about how we can unwind the harms of those who have most been impacted, people who have been arrested and put into jail,\" Papillion said.\n\nShe urged the president to pardon all nonviolent marijuana offenses, not just simple possession.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Biden said that marijuana should be decriminalized and that records should be expunged. Earlier this year, Biden granted nine people with federal marijuana offenses clemency.\n\nMaritza Perez, director of the Drug Policy Alliance's Office of Federal Affairs, said there should be fuller relief for people, including resentencing, expungement and removing immigration consequences.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction, but definitely does not do enough to really help repair the harms of the drug war,\" she said.\n\nPerez said she hopes Congress will act on several bills dealing with marijuana legalization.\n\nThere are several measures being considered. The Harnessing Opportunities by Pursuing Expungement Act, or HOPE, seeks to help states with the financial cost of expounding cannabis offenses.\n\nThe Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act and the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act both seek to find a process to expunge certain marijuana offenses.

Some have served on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many are Black or brown, and the White House said each has displayed efforts to rehabilitate themselves.\n\nWhat to know:Biden pardoned 3 felons. Here's what to know about presidential clemency powers\n\nThe clemency announcements, which coincided with national \"Second Chance Month,\" came as Biden also announced new actions aimed at improving outcomes for felons who reenter society as part of a broader strategy to reform the criminal justice system. Efforts include $145 million for a federal program to train the incarcerated for future employment and the removal of criminal history in applications for Small Business Administration grants.\n\n\"America is a nation of laws and second chances, redemption, and rehabilitation,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Elected officials on both sides of the aisle, faith leaders, civil rights advocates, and law enforcement leaders agree that our criminal justice system can and should reflect these core values that enable safer and stronger communities.\"\n\nMore:Bidentouts efforts to make government fairer, but major bills on social justice remain stalled\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant clemency to forgive convictions. A pardon represents a full legal forgiveness for a crime, removing any remaining prison sentence, probation conditions or unpaid fines as well as collateral consequences to allow felons to vote, hold professional licenses, run for public office or own a gun.\n\nA commutation is a narrower grant of mercy used to shorten a prison sentence while leaving the conviction intact. Many of Biden's commutations leave intact home confinement or supervised release terms.\n\nWith Tuesday's action, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden has granted clemency to more people at this point in a first term than each of his five immediate predecessors. \"That is because this is a priority to the president,\" she said, adding that Biden will continue to review clemency applications.\n\nThe individuals granted clemency came at the recommendation of the Department of Justice's pardon attorney, according to senior Biden administration officials who briefed reporters ahead announcement. It marks the return of a practice that was largely bypassed by former President Donald Trump, whose clemency requests often came through close aides.\n\nBiden said the three people pardoned have each \"demonstrated their commitment to rehabilitation and are striving every day to give back and contribute to their communities.\"\n\nThe highest-profile pardon is Bolden, a former Secret Service agent appointed by then-President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Bolden was charged with trying to sell a copy of a U.S. Secret Service file. Bolden, who always maintained his innocence, was convicted even though some witnesses who testified against him admitted lying at the request of the prosecutor.\n\nMore:Businesses that hired inmates who were allowed to serve time at home during COVID push for clemency\n\nBolden has said he was the target of retaliation for exposing unprofessional and racist behavior within the Secret Service.\n\nNearly one-third of the 75 commutation recipients would have received lower sentences had they had been charged today under the Trump-era criminal justice law, the First Step Act, according to senior Biden administration officials. They have served an average of 10 years in prison and have \"shown resilience\" in seeking a productive path forward, a White House official said.\n\nThe actions come as Biden faces pressure from criminal justice advocates to take action on police accountability via executive power after legislative efforts have failed. A White House official said Tuesday's announcements do not supplant the president's police accountability efforts.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @Joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/hunter-biden-investigation-critical-juncture/index.html", "title": "Federal investigation of Hunter Biden reaches critical juncture ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s business activities is nearing a critical juncture as investigators weigh possible charges and prosecutors confront Justice Department guidelines to generally avoid bringing politically sensitive cases close to an election, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nWhile no final decision has been made on whether to bring charges against President Joe Biden’s son, sources say the probe has intensified in recent months along with discussions among Delaware-based prosecutors, investigators running the probe and officials at Justice Department headquarters.\n\nDavid Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, is leading the probe, which dates back to as early as 2018.\n\nDiscussions recently have centered around possibly bringing charges that could include alleged tax violations and making a false statement in connection with Biden’s purchase of a firearm at a time he would have been prohibited from doing so because of his acknowledged struggles with drug addiction.\n\nThe investigation of the President’s son has loomed large among the politically fraught issues Merrick Garland faces as attorney general. Weiss is one of a handful of appointees of former President Donald Trump who were kept on by the Biden administration because they were overseeing politically sensitive investigations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Republicans in Congress have already announced that if they take over the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, they plan to launch new investigations and hold hearings to examine the conduct of Hunter Biden and others in the Biden family.\n\nAlso potentially in play are Justice Department guidelines governing politically sensitive investigations during an election year. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that prosecutors avoid bringing politically sensitive cases within 60 days of an election.\n\nSome current and former Justice officials have debated whether the rules necessarily apply in this instance since Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot in the midterms.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment. The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware declined to comment.\n\nHunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has previously denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son’s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed.\n\nNarrowing the focus\n\nThe Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden’s financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president. But investigators have examined a swath of broader conduct, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated money laundering, campaign finance, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as whether Hunter Biden broke federal firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said.\n\nAs the investigation has entered its final stages, prosecutors have narrowed their focus to tax and gun-related charges, the people say.\n\nJustice officials have debated the strength of the case for months, and have held discussions about whether more work is needed before deciding on possible charges. Those discussions have involved investigators from the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agency and prosecutors in Delaware and at Justice Department headquarters, CNN previously reported.\n\nHunter Biden has publicly discussed his own substance abuse struggles, and some Justice officials questioned whether his open discussions of his past drug use could potentially weaken their case should they bring one.\n\nSome officials have noted that Biden could argue he wasn’t aware of wrongdoing because he was on drugs, one source said. CNN has previously reported that some officials were concerned it could be a defense, but more recently, Justice officials have coalesced around the view that Biden’s own public accounts of his recovery show he was fully responsible for actions now under scrutiny, according to the person familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn the meetings, officials also discussed the timing of any possible indictment given the sensitivity of bringing a politically connected case close to an election, another person said.\n\nJustice Department memoranda advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate.\n\nGarland issued a memo in May to prosecutors reiterating the department’s stance on election year sensitivities. The memo is one attorneys general send every election year, and generally advises prosecutors about avoiding making major investigative or charging decisions near an election to avoid the perception of partisan motives.\n\nIn 2018, the last year of congressional midterm elections, prosecutors with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year.\n\nIn both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind, people familiar with the cases said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty that August to campaign finance, tax and other charges and completed a three-year prison sentence. Collins, who won his reelection while under indictment, later pleaded guilty and resigned his seat. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison but only served two months after he was pardoned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump Justice officials pushed back on a request by New York prosecutors to execute a search warrant on Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, during the months around the 2020 election. The Biden Justice Department later greenlit the search, which was approved by a federal judge.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Kara Scannell", "Evan Perez", "Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}]}

The annual ceremony is returning to central London after a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an impressive display of military pageantry, more than 1,200 officers from the Queen’s personal troops, the Household Division, will be joined by several hundred Army musicians and 240 horses. The “colour” – or regimental flag – will be trooped by the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards.

The Queen, a keen horse breeder herself, has been a regular spectator at the event and has even presented the famous trophy in years gone by.\n\nIn the evening, a two-and-a-half hour “Platinum Party At The Palace” concert will see a star-studded line up take to three stages built in front of Buckingham Palace and the famous Queen Victoria Memorial. Queen + Adam Lambert, Alicia Keys and Diana Ross are among the artists set to perform their biggest hits at the show, which will be broadcast live by the BBC.

Community gatherings are set to take place across Britain, including flagship events in London and at Cornwall’s Eden Project – where the idea for the lunches originated. “Big Jubilee Lunches” have also been planned around the world, from Canada to Brazil to South Africa and Japan.\n\nThe weekend’s finale is the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, in which artistic performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers will unite to bring iconic moments from the Queen’s reign to life in a festival of creativity. Starting at 2:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. ET), the pageant will involve a “River of Hope” section that will comprise 200 silk flags parading down The Mall like a river.

Some will also deploy to all four UK nations during the four-day extravaganza, with the Queen sending the Cambridges to Wales, the Earl and Countess of Wessex to Northern Ireland and Princess Anne to Scotland.\n\nAnd after much speculation, it has also been confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their children, will be flying back to the UK for the celebrations.\n\nThe British royal family wave to crowds from Buckingham Palace during Diamond Jubilee commemorations in 2012.

Jonathan Brady/Pool/AFP/Getty Images Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/arizona/2016/08/29/mcdonalds-first-drive-through-sierra-vista-arizona/88009974/", "title": "You won't believe where McDonald's opened its first drive-thru", "text": "Scott Craven\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nImagine pulling into America’s most prevalent fast-food franchise and having no choice but to get out of your car and march a hundred feet or more just to place your order.\n\nLooming is the return trip to the car, only now it will be as a pack mule.

But before 1975, there was no such thing as a McDonald’s drive-through.\n\nLet that sink in. You parked. You went to the counter. You waited with no music, no AC blowing directly on you, no Pokemon to catch. The fast-food dark ages.\n\nRELATED:McDonald's: A fast-food history | McDonald's pulls fitness trackers from Happy Meals | Phoenix mom turns a McDonald's coffee a day into $50K | How Casa Grande crosses helped fight the Cold War\n\nThe reign of order-at-the-counter terrorism ended Jan. 24, 1975, when an ingenious franchise owner cut a hole in the side of his restaurant that allowed customers to order food the way it was always intended — from behind the wheel of a running vehicle.\n\nAnd it just so happens that our men and women in uniform played a vital role in this innovation. Specifically, those men and women stationed at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista.\n\nThat’s right, Arizona was at the forefront of McDonald’s drive-through history. The fast-food giant gets 63 percent of its business from customers who stay in their cars, and Sierra Vista was Ground Zero for an innovation that was one small step for a hungry family, one giant “Please pull up to the window” for mankind.\n\nIt was an invention born of necessity rather than convenience, one that was required for the survival of one particular franchise.\n\nTo grasp the enormity of the burger company’s first drive-through, one must look at it through history’s kaleidoscope of influential changes. There you’ll see Jordan Martin, who in the 1930s developed the drive-through for banks. And many were actual drive-throughs, cut into the middle of buildings.\n\nDecades passed and Americans found reasons to spend more time behind the wheel, from short trips to the store to cross-country vacations. As the love affair deepened, so did butt-grooves on the front seats.\n\nCar culture grew most dominant in the West, and restaurant owners soon reached out (and through car windows) to their vehicle-based customers. Drive-ins flourished as servers ferried food from counter to car.\n\nAt most McDonald’s restaurants in the 1950s and 1960s, counter culture thrived. Patrons placed face-to-face orders and either ate in their cars or took the food home. A few might take a seat on benches outside, about the only amenity offered to the rare dine-in customers.\n\nThe business model began to change in the 1970s when customers showed interest in a daring innovation, according to McDonald’s archivist Mike Bullington.\n\nThey wanted to eat where they ordered, and thus a remodeling program was started to install indoor seating, the anti-drive-through. The simple red-and-white-tiled outlets slowly transformed into the mansard-roofed restaurants familiar today.\n\n“We saw that innovations were needed to meet what customers were asking for,” Bullington said. And by the early '70s, customers didn’t seem interested in dashboard dining.\n\nBy this time, the first fast-food drive-throughs were more than 20 years old. A handful of burger stands claim the first full-service drive-through, including In-N-Out (1948, using a simple intercom system).\n\nBut Sheldon “Red” Chaney is widely credited with the first patty-centered drive-through when in 1947 he opened Red’s Hamburg along Route 66 in Springfield, Mo.\n\nBut even as Flower Power gave way to disco, McDonald’s didn’t seriously consider drive-throughs. After all, the two things most crucial to eating while driving — cup holders and passive restraint systems — were still years away from becoming standard equipment.\n\nIn 1974, a McDonald’s regional manager in Dallas noticed how well drive-through restaurants were doing in Oklahoma City. He eventually got the OK to design and build the company’s first drive-through — a thoughtful garden-themed four-column portico to be attached to an Oklahoma City restaurant. It would be populated by a handful of McDonald’s characters, including a full-size Ronald McDonald statue that would take orders via speaker and microphone.\n\nWord of the project eventually reached David Rich, operator of the McDonald’s in Sierra Vista. He was intrigued because some of his best customers weren’t allowed to order at the counter.\n\nSoldiers at Fort Huachuca were not allowed to appear in public in their work or duty uniforms, a longstanding rule that had to do with military decorum, according to Steve Gregory, a technician at the Fort Huachuca Museum.\n\nBecause the base was just 2 miles down Sierra Vista’s main drag from McDonald’s, soldiers heading to and from work were dressed the part. Rich, who had opened his franchise the year before, knew the uniform policy meant soldiers would drive by rather than in.\n\nBut what about through?\n\nErecting a lovely portico populated with character statues required time Rich didn't have. Instead, he pushed out a small portion of the wall, creating just enough space for an attendant. He installed a small sliding window, low enough to be reached via car window, wide enough to pass burgers and a side of fries.\n\nOn Jan. 24, 1975, the world’s largest fast-food franchise opened its first drive-through.\n\nLeann Richards, who bought the Sierra Vista franchise in 1989, said the post commander and his daughter were the first in line.\n\n“It was a big thing in a small town,” Richards said. “Soldiers are still a very important part of our business.\"\n\nIn the 41 years since that fateful day, thousands of burgers have been dished to drivers, if not countless coins plunking on pavement during counter-to-car cash transactions.\n\nGregory, the fort museum tech, recalled how the window was an instant hit. He encountered long lines of soldiers at the drive-through when he and his friends needed a burger fix.\n\n“In this little town in 1974, just getting a different restaurant to eat at (or as a teenager, to have another place to hang out) was a big thing,” Gregory wrote in an email. “As a high school student, we were bugged when the drive-thru first opened by the lines of the soldiers, which slowed us down on our lunch times as well.”\n\nTwo months later, McDonald's opened its second drive-through, in Tucker, Ga. The long-planned Oklahoma City drive-through debuted in April, and sales jumped 40 percent in just two months.\n\nThe concept went viral and by the end of 1979, nearly 2,700 of the nearly 5,000 McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. at that time had drive-throughs, according to restaurant spokesperson Lisa McComb.\n\nCompany officials don’t track specific drive-through numbers, but it’s estimated that most of the 14,000 McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. are equipped to handle vehicle-based orders.\n\nBut in 1975, the newfangled addition confused customers, Sierra Vista franchise owner Richards said. For safety’s sake, doors on the drive-through side remained locked so hungry patrons wouldn't walk in front of vehicles.\n\n“People were very unfamiliar with the concept,” she said. “They didn’t know to look for cars.”\n\nUnfortunately, the original drive-through was flipped out of existence by the spatula of time. In 1999, the restaurant was leveled to clear the way for a new, updated McDonald’s, this one with two drive-through windows.\n\n“It was not an easy decision,” Richards said. “But the old restaurant needed to be replaced.”\n\nBefore the old building went to that big Dollar Menu in the sky, much of it was auctioned off piece by McPiece. If it could be unbolted, cut out or otherwise detached, it would be sold.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL:Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nPatrick Arbenz, a Sierra Vista resident, submitted a winning bid for glass, a material he neither desired nor needed. But the reason for his bid was as transparent as his purchase. He wanted the drive-through window, behind which his teen daughter spent many minimum-wage hours, greeting customers with a cheery, “Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?”\n\n“My dad knew how upset I was when they were about to tear down the McDonald’s,” Debbie Arbenz, 58, recalled. “When he showed up a few weeks later with the window, it was so unique, so over the top. But that’s how my dad was.”\n\nFor decades Arbenz held onto the window. It was a treasured relic from teen-hood, if not a conversation starter. She doesn't know how much he paid for the glass.\n\nThen, in early 2014, the retired teacher attended a tourism meeting representing Ramsey Canyon Preserve (where she now works). When Arbenz casually mentioned owning the window, one person popped up like a jack-in-the-box.\n\nNancy Krieski, curator for the local museum, had been trying to track down the window for two years. She was in charge of putting together a tribute to Sierra Vista’s 60th anniversary. Her goal was to collect 60 iconic items that told the town’s story.\n\nAnd that story would be incomplete without something representing the world’s first McDonald’s drive-through.\n\nWhat better than the actual window, a two-pane slider that launched a thousand (and more) Egg McMuffins?\n\n“All that time looking and I find it by pure luck,” Krieski said. “I’m just glad someone kept it.”\n\nToday that window of drive-through opportunity sits in the lobby of the Ethel H. Berger Center, which houses the Henry F. Hauser Museum. It’s set in a sturdy rectangle of oak built by its buyer, who thought it important enough to be framed for history.\n\nIn April 2014, the Sierra Vista Historical Society unveiled a plaque commemorating the city’s place in McDonald’s history.

The A.V. Club raved, “It’s more minimal than The xx, more romantic than the most heartsick R&B, with drums pulled straight from ’70s studio sessions.

The tiny animal is now known to survive in just two creeks near Sand Mountain, where it burrows under rocks in shallow, slow-moving waters, Al.com reports. The animal lost most of its original habitat when the Tennessee River was dammed to create Lake Guntersville in 1939. And the population is still dwindling. Biologists who study the slenderclaw crayfish are not entirely certain why the population is still declining. More uncertainty surrounds whether the animal will get formal protections from the federal government. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list the crayfish as a threatened species, but the change may not be as protective as in the past, due to recently announced changes by the Trump administration.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: The Kenai River Foundation hosted its 13th annual Wounded Warriors fishing trip this month, bringing 68 active-duty soldiers stationed in the state down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish for salmon on the river. The trip is free for the soldiers and is made possible thanks to donations from sponsors including the Central Peninsula Hospital, Alaska Communications, Fairweather, LLC, Price Gregory International and Siemens Building Technologies. Professional fishing guides volunteered their services for the two days, and riders from several chapters of the American Legion provided a military escort for the buses that brought the soldiers primarily stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to and from Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers could make cities pay for raising the minimum wage. A new law that takes effect Aug. 27 requires the state to calculate the cost to Arizona’s government when cities and counties raise the minimum wage above the statewide rate. If the state has to pay more for services in those communities because of a higher minimum wage, legislators could force local governments to cover the additional costs. Proponents of the measure argue it is only fair after Flagstaff voters elected in 2016 to raise the minimum wage above the state’s rate, in turn requiring government contractors to increase pay for some low-wage workers. But others view it as an effort by the Republican-controlled Legislature to curtail the power of local governments.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Officials say two more medical marijuana dispensaries are expected to open in the state’s northwest this year. Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says both dispensaries will be in Fayetteville. They’ll join the region’s first dispensary, The ReLeaf Center, which opened earlier this month in Bentonville, and another called The Source, which opened last week in Bentonville. The two Bentonville dispensaries are the seventh and eighth to open in the state since voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2016. The state has licensed 32 dispensaries to sell medical marijuana. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the state had issued more than 19,000 patient or caregiver cards as of Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: Scientists have installed an underwater sound system they hope will reduce collisions between whales and ships in the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California. A listening station on the channel floor is able to capture whale calls as far away as 30 miles, the Los Angeles Times reports. That device is connected by cable to a buoy floating above that transmits data by satellite to scientists on shore. From there, captains can be alerted to slow their ships down or reroute. It’s the latest attempt to prevent ships from running into whales in the channel, where cargo vessels in and out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach cross feeding grounds of endangered blue, fin and humpback whales.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the North Front Range region missed its air quality standards deadline. The EPA is expected to mark the nine-county region that includes Denver County in serious noncompliance with a federal standard. Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease. Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard Friday in the region to reduce the effects. Experts say air quality improved on average over the past decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWilton: The town has halted guardrail improvements following complaints about the look of new, steel barriers on some residential streets. Wood and wire guardrails traditionally have lined the roads in Wilton, a Fairfield County town on the line with New York state. First Selectwoman Lynne Vanderslice imposed a moratorium on upgrades this month after residents raised issues with the aesthetics of the steel replacements. The town had been installing steel guardrails in sections, such as along bends and near culverts, on two roads where the old guardrails were showing their age. Public works officials say the moratorium will provide an opportunity to conduct engineering studies and assess alternative guardrail styles and whether guardrails are even needed on those roads.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: Busted boats and outdated laptops are among 2,000-plus items that will be going to auction next month as town officials try to wipe away the scars from participating in a military surplus program. The goal for now, Mayor T.J. Redefer says, is to get the number of items as close to zero as possible to help to rebuild the community’s trust in the government. The stockpile is cited in a federal lawsuit regarding public access to a report on the program, which had found there was little town oversight and questionable accounting. The surplus items were requested by Dewey Beach police working with the Law Enforcement Support Office program, which helps local agencies reuse Department of Defense equipment. The only cost is shipping and transportation of the items, but sometimes the available items look better online than in person, Redefer says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Confidential documents show the former chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority sought to limit an ethics investigation and prevent its findings from being made public. The Washington Post reports Jack Evans’ actions are detailed in investigative documents obtained from WMATA’s ethics committee. Records show Evans threatened the jobs of a board lawyer and secretary while trying to hide the findings of an ethics probe, which found he failed to disclose a profitable conflict-of-interest. Evans’ lawyer, Mark Tuohey, says Evans never intended that anyone be fired. Clarence C. Crawford, who chaired the ethics committee, made the findings public at the request of state and local officials. Evans resigned his transit job days later but remains a city councilman.\n\nFlorida\n\nDavie: The state’s iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps in months, with no chance for recovery once they become ill. Spread by a rice-sized, plant-hopping insect, lethal bronzing has gone from a small infestation on the Gulf Coast to a nearly statewide problem in just over a decade. Tens of thousands of palm trees have died from the bacterial disease, and the pace of its spread is increasing, adding to environmental woes of a state already struggling to save its other arboreal icon, citrus trees, from two other diseases. Florida’s official state tree – the tall, broad-leafed sabal palm – is especially susceptible, and Florida nurseries, businesses and homeowners are taking a financial hit as they scrap infected palms. Some preventive measures can be taken, but once infected, uprooting the tree is the only practical solution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Experts say the state is among those most at risk of its residents not being counted accurately in the 2020 census. The Urban Institute says children under the age of 5 are especially at risk of being undercounted due to Georgia’s changing demographics. WABE Radio reports that nationwide, 4.5 million children live in areas that are difficult to count for the 2020 census. Statewide, 22% of Georgia’s population lives in areas considered hard to count. The radio station reports there are several reasons why so many Georgia children are difficult to count: They are often in young families, immigrant families and multigenerational homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nAuwahi: Musician Paul Simon has joined environmentalists attempting to reinvigorate a woodland by planting a tree during a ceremony on Maui. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday that the celebrated singer-songwriter joined Auwahi Forest Restoration Project volunteers seeking to revive the area’s plant life. Simon helped plant a lama tree and participated in chants with the group following a helicopter tour. The part-time Maui resident performed two environmental benefit concerts at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center earlier in the week that drew more than 8,000 attendees. Simon plans to donate his proceeds to the Auwahi project and Hawaii environmental group Kuaaina Ulu Auamo. Simon was put in contact with the environmentalists after visiting Hoolawa Farms in Haiku to view a rare kanaloa plant, one of only two in existence.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have approved two open-pit phosphate mines that include environmental protections intended to prevent the type of pollution caused by past phosphate mining in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says it approved the Caldwell Canyon Mine project in Caribou County, about 13 miles northeast of Soda Springs. Bayer subsidiary P4 Production will develop the mines on three phosphate leases. Bayer acquired agricultural giant Monsanto, which previously mined the area, for $63 billion last year. The area contains one the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. Idaho-based Simplot also has a mine in the area. But the area also contains Superfund sites because of pollution from past phosphate mining.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum has received more than $400,000 in grants for a project that aims to publish every document written by the nation’s 16th president. The Springfield-based library says the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project was awarded up to $350,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission awarded the project $87,125. Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, says the grants show that experts in the field are confident the project “is on the right path to fulfill its important mission.” The project launched online in 2018. It gives people access to documents from private collections and archives held around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: The new home of Indiana University’s art school will be modeled after an unbuilt fraternity house a famed modernist architect designed in the 1950s. IU’s trustees recently approved construction of the $10 million Mies van der Rohe Building. When completed in 2021, it will bring the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture and Design’s programs together within one building. The Herald-Times reports the 10,000-square-foot structure will be made of limestone, steel and glass, with second-floor windows spanning floor to ceiling. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-born architect known for his “less is more” approach emphasizing open space and industrial materials. He designed a fraternity house for Phi Lambda Phi in the early 1950s, but it went unbuilt. The new building will be similar to his design, with modern upgrades.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Robert Wolf has about 250 boxes of rock samples sitting in his garage waiting for a crew from the University of Iowa to come pick them up with a 20-foot truck. The collection took the better part of 30 years to find. Each rock sample has a number and is recorded in a log book that tells what it is, where it was collected and when he found it, The Messenger reports. And the collection is all Iowan. “There’s a sample of every formation in Iowa,” he says. “There are 350 rock units in and around Iowa. I have all the families and 95% of the members. That’s what makes this collection unique. It’s a good representation of the state of Iowa.” What makes his collection valuable and of interest to a university is that it’s properly cataloged. Without the information Wolf recorded, it’s just a big pile of rocks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are expressing concern after a recent survey found more than 1,000 motorists illegally passed stopped school buses in one day. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports a task force is expected to make recommendations during the next legislative session on how to reduce the number of violations. In the April survey, 220 districts in Kansas that use 3,300 school buses reported 1,040 violations by motorists. That compares with April of 2018, when 214 districts operating 3,347 buses documented 1,030 infractions. Jim Porter, the southeast Kansas representative on the Kansas Board of Education, noted the sample included only three-fourths of the state’s districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tourism officials say more people visited the state in 2018 and spent more money. Officials say visitor trips to and within the state topped 71.6 million last year, and visitor spending rose to nearly $7.6 billion, up nearly 4% over the prior year and a 21% increase since 2013. The figures are the result of a study from Tourism Economics, the state Department of Tourism’s new research partner. Using the Tourism Economics model, officials say the industry’s economic impact in Kentucky went from $10.9 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion in 2018, generating more than 94,500 jobs and $787 million in state and local taxes. The tourism department says it continues to build on Kentucky’s signature tourism industries of horses, bourbon, music, arts, outdoors and culinary to reach new audiences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three days of public events will honor former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the state’s first female governor, who died after a years­long struggle with cancer. The Democrat who led Louisiana during hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be memorialized Thursday at an interfaith service in downtown Baton Rouge at St. Joseph’s Cathedral. Her casket then will be taken to the Louisiana Capitol, where Blanco’s body will lie in Memorial Hall for public visitation. On Friday, mourners in Louisiana’s Acadiana region can attend a prayer service for the former governor in Lafayette at St. John the Evangelist Cathedral. Blanco’s funeral Mass will be Saturday in Lafayette, followed by a private burial service. Blanco died Sunday. She was 76.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: Nature lovers who encounter fluttering butterflies might also be able to contribute to research about the colorful insects. Researchers at the University of Maine say residents can use a mobile app called the Monarch Model Validator to provide details about areas where butterflies are likely to be found. They plan to use the data as part of a model designed to predict the location of monarch butterfly nesting sites. The UMaine researchers say monarch butterflies begin a 3,000-mile migration south every fall. They also say the number of monarchs that complete the migration has fallen by 90% in the past two decades. App users will be able to answer a short survey and provide photos. They’ll be able to head to predetermined sites or find locations of their own.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Lawyers for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial” are asking the Supreme Court to step into the case. Lawyers for defendant Adnan Syed said in court papers Monday that the justices should order a new trial for Syed and reverse a Maryland court ruling against him. Syed claims his trial lawyer violated his constitutional right to competent representation because she failed to investigate an alibi witness. Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were high school classmates who had dated. In its debut 2014 season, the “Serial” podcast shined a spotlight on the case that led to renewed court proceedings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The memorial to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing is complete. Three stone pillars representing the three people who died at the finish line were installed Monday, marking the final step of the $2 million project, which took four years to plan and develop and underwent significant redesigns and other delays. Bolivian-born sculptor Pablo Eduardo said it was important that the final work reflect the hopes and expectations of families who lost loved ones. The monument includes four bronze and glass spires installed last month to illuminate the site. Cherry trees to bloom each April have also been planted, and two bronze bricks have been set in the sidewalk to honor the police officers killed in the bombing’s aftermath. The pillars installed Monday were gathered from places around Boston significant to the bombing victims.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A copy of the original land contract for Motown Records’ Hitsville U.S.A. will be unveiled as part of the music company’s 60th anniversary celebration. Officials with the Motown Museum, located where Berry Gordy Jr. launched his music empire, say they will share the rarely seen document via Facebook at 3 p.m. Tuesday. That coincides with the 1959 date that Gordy purchased the house on West Grand Boulevard. Museum CEO and Chairwoman Robin Terry called it “the start of a journey that would ultimately rock the world.” The event is part of a series of “archive dives” this year to coincide with milestone dates. The Supremes, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and many others recorded hits there before Motown moved in 1972 to California.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Almost 90 musical acts will descend on the city this week for the Common Roots Festival, performing myriad styles on 12 different stages. The festival, now in its third year, was originally conceived as a way to breathe life back into downtown venues, restaurants and businesses during a major street construction project in 2017. Although that project has been completed, the volunteer team behind the festival has continued the mission to bring folks to downtown St. Cloud. “Downtown is now under a deluge of construction again, and we are hearing from business folks in that area that it is affecting business. So we’re right back where we started three years ago,” says festival coordinator Dawn Yilek. It all kicks off Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Beaver Island Brewing Company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group that advocates limited government is suing the state over its licensing requirement for people who earn money by plucking eyebrows with thread. Mississippi Justice Institute filed the lawsuit Monday on behalf of Dipa Bhattarai, a University of Mississippi graduate student. She grew up in Nepal, where she learned the technique of using a single strand of cotton thread to remove hair. Mississippi requires people who receive money for eyebrow threading to earn an esthetician’s license. The license requires training and exams, but none of the training deals with threading. The Mississippi Board of Cosmetology shut down Bhattarai’s business, and she wants to reopen it. She says she started earning money by threading eyebrows while she was a student at Mississippi University for Women in Columbus. “It’s going to sound cliche, but I just started my business with $240,” Bhattarai says.\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Authorities are looking for an inmate who escaped from a crew that was helping to clean up after the Missouri State Fair came to an end for the year. Department of Corrections spokesman Karen Pojmann says 34-year-old Shannon Dewayne Watts, of Springfield, was reported missing about 12:45 a.m. Monday when he didn’t return to a van to head back to the Tipton Correctional Center. He was serving a 15-year sentence there for charges that included burglary, resisting arrest and tampering with a motor vehicle. The search was expanded beyond the nearly 400-acre fairgrounds in Sedalia several hours later when law enforcement couldn’t find Watts. He is described as 6 feet tall and 195 pounds. The 11-day fair began Aug. 8 and ended Sunday night.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A University of Montana art historian has called for a new state flag after receiving a top research award. The Missoulian reports Hipolito Rafael Chacon announced the idea Thursday to redesign the state’s identity with a new flag. Officials say his research received an award last month from the International Congress of Vexillology, a worldwide association of flag researchers. Officials say the design originated from just the seal because Montana troops needed a banner to carry in the Spanish-American War. Officials say the Legislature added the name of the state in 1981. Chacon says a public design competition could be the best way to select a new design. Experts say former historians tried to change the design decades ago, but state officials laughed at the idea.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinslow: Residents of this tiny community who are reeling from flooding this year are considering whether to move their entire town uphill. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the swollen Elkhorn River flowed in mid-March over a levee built to protect Winslow, damaging almost all 38 homes and 10 other buildings in the Dodge County town. Town leaders have proposed moving Winslow out of the flood plain to a new site, possibly a hilltop about 2 miles away. Town officials say that if residents stay, they’ll be at the mercy of the river. Zachary Klein, a village trustee and the volunteer fire chief, says the move could take two years. Klein says funding is available from federal, state and local sources.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials in the city are using the word “outbreak” to describe a sharp spike in hepatitis A cases reported mostly among homeless people and drug users. The Southern Nevada Health District reports that in seven months from November to June, it counted 83 cases of the virus that causes liver damage and can lead to death. That’s far more than the 58 cases reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018 combined. The district says more than 80% of reported patients were people without a permanent place to live, and 92% use drugs, some intravenous. The district has begun posting weekly outbreak updates on its website. Hepatitis A is most often transmitted through consumption of water or food contaminated with feces.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire researcher says oyster production in the state is only a small fraction of what it could be. Ray Grizzle, research professor of biological sciences, says the total number of farms is probably nearing the maximum for the Little Bay area, but production isn’t yet. USDA data in the 2017 Census of Agriculture says the state has 32 commercial mollusk operations in Strafford and Rockingham counties representing $419,000 in sales. Most of them are oyster farming. New Hampshire only had two licensed oyster farms when Grizzle began conducting research about 10 years ago. Grizzle, who’s with the university’s New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station, says some farms have included improved farming methods and marketing networks that involve wholesalers as well as directly selling to local chefs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The mayor says it could take another month before additional testing is completed on lead levels in the city’s water supply. That means residents in affected neighborhoods will have to continue receiving bottled water. Mayor Ras Baraka’s comments on a radio show Sunday were first reported by Politico. Newark began distributing bottled water a week ago after lead levels tested high in a few homes even though residents have been given water filters. About 14,000 homes are affected. In addition, a federal judge is expected to rule this week on an environmental group’s effort to force Newark to distribute water to thousands more residents who are served by a different water system. The Natural Resources Defense Council says those residents also are at risk from excessive lead levels.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say they have plans for $13 billion worth of construction projects over the next decade at the northern New Mexico complex. They outlined their plans at a recent meeting attended by hundreds of representatives of construction firms from around the country. Most of the projects are related to the lab’s assignment to ramp up production of key nuclear weapon components known as plutonium cores. Other work would be aimed at serving a growing workforce, such as housing projects, parking garages and a potential new highway that would reduce commute times from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Lab Director Thomas Mason tells the Albuquerque Journal the lab currently has 1,400 openings and plans to add another 1,200 jobs to its workforce of 12,000 by 2026.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State officials are asking the public to help choose a new license plate design. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says people can vote on the governor’s website for one of five plate designs. Four of the designs include the Statue of Liberty, while one features the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River. Voting runs through Sept. 2. The design with the most votes will become available in April. The new ones will replace the state’s blue-and-white plates, most of which are more than 10 years old. As vehicle owners renew their registrations, owners with license plates 10 years old or older will be issued new plates for a $25 fee. Once the new plates become available, the Department of Motor Vehicles also will stop issuing the newer blue-and-gold plates.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration is proposing a plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that the plan calls for cutting greenhouse gases from electricity production by 60% to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030, with a goal of getting to zero emissions by 2050. The state Department of Environmental Quality says North Carolina already has made progress toward cutting emissions, which are 34% lower than 2005 levels. Some of the plan’s suggestions include requiring the retirement of coal power plants and requiring utilities to increase use of renewable energy. It also suggests setting carbon dioxide budgets or carbon caps, or a combination of those approaches. The proposal stems from an executive order Cooper signed last year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A landfill north of the city could soon become the first facility in the state to accept higher levels of radioactive oil-field waste under new state regulations. The Bismarck Tribune reports Secure Energy Services is seeking permits allowing it to dispose of radioactive material at its 13-Mile Landfill, which already accepts other types of waste generated by oil development. The Health Department increased the allowable concentrations of technologically enhanced radioactive material to be disposed of at approved landfills from 5 picocuries per gram to 50 picocuries per gram in 2016. Picocuries are a measure of radioactivity. The change was controversial at the time, drawing lengthy hearings and a lawsuit from environmental groups.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: Eighty years after Rhoda Wise first claimed she was a receiver of Christian miracles, people are still visiting her home to see for themselves. Busloads of the faithful and curious come to Wise’s home in Canton to see the room where it is believed she was cured of a terminal illness and regularly was visited by Jesus Christ. The small wood-frame house is an unlikely Roman Catholic shrine nestled in a frayed neighborhood next to a nine-hole golf course. But every year it attracts visitors from all over the world. Visitor numbers are getting a boost this summer thanks to the local Roman Catholic diocese formally petitioning the Vatican to have Wise declared a saint. Wise died in 1948 at age 60.\n\nOklahoma\n\nCushing: Officials have closed a recreational lake while they monitor a dam breach in the area. City Manager Terry Brannon said Sunday that a breach has been detected in a concrete structure beneath the dam at Cushing Lake near this city about 55 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Officials say the breach is allowing water to pass unrestricted, but the flow remains controlled, meaning there hasn’t been a complete dam failure. Owned by the city of Cushing, Cushing Lake is about 9 miles west of Cushing, an oil hub with 300 storage tanks. Officials say the area affected by the breach includes fields and livestock but no structures. Authorities say police are notifying property owners and others with livestock downstream of the dam.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde have finalized their purchase of the former Blue Heron paper mill site at Willamette Falls. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the site that was once home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla now belongs to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The 23-acre property is located within the tribes’ ancestral homelands and holds significant historical and cultural importance for the Grand Ronde. Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde chairwoman Cheryle A. Kennedy says they have reclaimed a piece of their homeland and are resurrecting their role as caretakers to Willamette Falls. The area is part of the lands ceded to the United States government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855. Following the treaty, tribal members were forcibly removed from Willamette Falls and relocated to Grand Ronde.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSpringettsbury: It’s been three years since the last archaeological dig on farmland in this township to find remains from a Revolutionary War prison camp. A new dig started this month on a 4-acre area, and archaeologists and volunteers hope to uncover evidence that would help reveal the exact location of Camp Security. A few 18th-century items, such as wrought iron nails and Westerwald stoneware, have turned up, but “nothing yet that screams site,” says John Crawmer, lead archaeologist for the Friends of Camp Security. During the Revolutionary War, colonists held British prisoners of war from the Battle of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown at Camp Security from 1781 to 1783. It’s believed to be the last known Revolutionary War prison camp to remain undisturbed in the country. The public can visit the site Aug. 27 to learn more about the archaeological work.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Advocates for gun control demanded reforms at a gathering over the weekend. The Rhode Island chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America staged a rally Saturday to honor victims of the latest U.S. mass shootings and call for tougher gun legislation. Several dozen people attended the event. Some of the signs they held said “Disarm Hate,” “Enough” and “No One Needs a Weapon of War at Home.” Organizers say they’re pressing for a strong federal “red flag” bill to allow seizure of weapons in certain cases and legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America describes itself as a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A major building at the College of Charleston is set for a $50 million overhaul. The Post and Courier reports the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee agreed last month to borrow $45 million to renovate the university’s main arts building, the Albert Simons Center. Another $5 million will come from a one-time state appropriation. Architects are still designing the building’s new exterior. A previous renovation planned in the mid-1990s stalled amid exterior design disputes. School of the Arts Dean Valerie Morris says the renovation will create a black box theater for student productions, plus upgraded classrooms, bathrooms, and heating and cooling. Mold problems are promised to be fixed. Work could begin in summer 2020, with the art school temporarily relocating. The overhaul could be complete by fall 2022.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The U.S. Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state were unable to plant more than 3.8 million acres this year, the highest number in the nation. KSFY-TV reports the tally includes 2.8 million unplanted corn acres and nearly 851,000 acres for soybeans. The USDA says the total number of unplanted acres nationwide was more than 19 million acres, the highest since the agency began reporting those figures in 2007. Many states across the Midwest were hit hard by flooding this spring, leading to fields being too wet for farmers to plant.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis has launched a new initiative in hopes of raising graduation rates among its black male students, the school announced Monday. The African American Male Academy will start with a group of black male students in middle school and pair them with peer and faculty mentors, provide textbooks and other educational supplies, and give them access to early academic and career preparation. “Most students are in good academic standing when they leave the U of M before graduation – they leave for financial reasons,” university officials wrote in a statement announcing the program, adding that 60% of its students work more than 20 hours a week and have to help provide for their families. Students inducted into the academy will also be informed of scholarship programs and other “culturally responsive” initiatives meant to keep them in school and make their educations more affordable.\n\nTexas\n\nKemah: The Galveston Bay Foundation has seen the first structure go up on 30 acres of bayfront land it acquired in 2016. The Galveston County Daily News reports a pavilion designed and built by students from the University of Texas School of Architecture’s Gulf Coast DesignLab will be used to host as many as 75 students at a time in grades five to 12 from across the upper Texas coast region, helping them learn on-site about Galveston Bay’s wildlife, organisms, natural habitat and environmental threats. In June, DesignLab, an advanced studio design class, reached out to the foundation, offering its services. This motnh the architecture students went to Kemah and built the pavilion over a period of weeks. They put the finishing touches on it last week. A dedication is planned for Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A report says more women in the state are earning STEM-related degrees, but completion rates are still behind the national average. The Deseret News reports the Utah Women & Leadership Project released a study this month showing an additional 467 women graduated with science, technology, engineering and math degrees from 2012 to 2017. Officials say the 1% increase could be higher, but gender stereotypes have been attributed to women switching disciplines more frequently than men. Officials say girls who are introduced to women in STEM careers have increased their chances of engaging in a STEM curriculum by more than 60%. Officials say of the 44% of women in the workforce in Utah, there are a “particularly low” number of women who continue on to work in STEM industries.\n\nVermont\n\nWoodbury: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is seeking volunteers to become “Let’s Go Fishing” instructors who can pass on the fishing tradition to the next generation of Vermonters. The department will be hosting a one-day training workshop for new instructors Sept. 14 at the Buck Lake Conservation Camp in Woodbury. Instructors in the “Let’s Go Fishing” program organize and instruct clinics in their communities for young people and their families. The training workshop will give volunteers the basics of how to teach a basic fishing clinic. They will also learn about fishing ethics, aquatic ecology, fisheries management, habitat conservation and tackle craft. There is no charge, but pre-registration is required. Information can be found on the department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo has announced the birth of red panda triplets. The zoo in Norfolk announced Monday that the triplets were born two months ago and are thriving in a climate-controlled den that’s out of sight from the public. Zoo veterinarian Collen Clabbers says red panda triplets are a “unique situation” for the endangered species from Asia. But she says the mother is “doing a great job.” The two males and one female were born to mother Masu and dad Timur. The cubs will live in the red panda exhibit after zoo staff members feel the little ones can navigate the exhibit’s trees and other features. The zoo is auctioning naming rights in support of red panda conservation. Bids can be placed online.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The last four members of a wolf pack that preyed on cattle in a rural area of the state bordering Canada have been killed by state hunters, prompting protests from environmental groups. The four wolves were part of a pack that originally had seven members and attacked cows, killing or wounding them 29 times since 2018 and nine times over the past month, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement Friday. Agency director Kelly Susewind authorized the killings of the remaining pack members July 31. Environmental groups opposed the killings, which they contended benefited one ranching operation in Ferry County in the remote Kettle River Range. Hunters for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife who were inside helicopters tracked down and shot the wolves from the air Friday, agency spokeswoman Sam Montgomery says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain Valley Pipeline has suspended some construction activities that could affect threatened or endangered species. WVPR-FM reports pipeline officials sent a letter last week telling federal regulators about the voluntary suspension in areas where construction could affect protected bat and fish species. The move follows a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups last week that challenged approvals by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Conservation groups are asking the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to toss two key permits issued to the 303-mile natural gas pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia. The 4th Circuit last month threw out the same Fish and Wildlife approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Regulators say the pipeline may not resume the suspended construction without first seeking approval.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Native American tribes in the state are receiving federal grants for renewable energy projects that tribe members say will help reduce costs and lead to energy independence. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Odanah received a nearly $1 million grant, and the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Crandon got a grant for more than $1.5 million. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the grants will be used to install solar panels at tribal buildings. The move is expected to save the tribes millions of dollars in energy spending over the next 25 years. The Wisconsin tribes are among 12 nationwide that received a total of 14 grants from the federal Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs worth a total of $16 million.\n\nWyoming\n\nPowell: Wildlife officials say fewer grizzly bears have been euthanized this year in Yellowstone National Park compared to previous years. The Powell Tribune reports the U.S. Geological Survey says nine grizzlies were euthanized in Wyoming this year, but the number could increase before the bears go into hibernation in December. Officials say the Wyoming Game and Fish Department killed a record-high 32 grizzly bears in 2018, including 17 by mid-August last year. Officials say grizzly bears are euthanized to manage conflicts at the park that spans across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Wildlife officials say three bears have also died in automobile collisions. Officials say they encourage people in the region to carry some type of defense in case of an encounter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/20"}]}

Experts say raking and removing leaves can be worse for your yard – and for the planet, too.\n\nLeaving at least some of the leaves in your yard can help fertilize your grass and other plants, provide shelter for animals and even reduce emissions from landfills. Here's what you need to know about managing the leaves on your lawn this fall.\n\nHow do you grow a giant pumpkin? 75 gallons of water daily and hand-pollination, NY man says\n\nSpooky season:How to stay in the 'Hocus Pocus' cottage this Halloween near Salem, Massachusetts\n\nHow can leaves help my yard?\n\nFallen leaves can be a natural fertilizer for plants, David Mizejewski, a naturalist at the National Wildlife Federation, told USA TODAY.\n\n“The leaves fall around the root zone of these plants, where they do things like suppress weeds or other plants from growing that would otherwise compete with the trees and the shrubs,” he said.\n\n“They slowly break down and compost right there at the base of the of the tree of the shrub, right above its root zone, where they return nutrients that the plant can then recycle and reuse next spring.”\n\nCan I mow leaves instead of raking them?\n\nThat's a good idea. Mowing your lawn can break up leaves and bring nutrients to your grass, according to Maxim Schlossberg, an associate professor of turfgrass nutrition and soil fertility at Penn State.\n\n“Since they’re smaller, they're more rapidly dismantled and decomposed by microorganisms. And the whole recycling process of those nutrients being returned to the soil occurs more rapidly.”\n\nWhy is it better to leave the leaves rather than bag them?\n\nIf you usually rake leaves in your yard, put them in bags and throw them away, you might want to change your routine this autumn.\n\nLandfills in 2018 received about 10.5 million tons of yard clippings, including leaves, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMizejewski said leaves and other organic matter sent to landfills can break down and form methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.\n\n“At this time of year, unfortunately, a huge volume of leaves just go sit in those landfills and produce all this terrible greenhouse gas,” he said. “The more we can keep that organic material out of the landfill, the better.\"\n\nHow do my leaves affect the local environment?\n\nThe layer of leaves in your yard around trees and other plants is “really important wildlife habitat,”Mizejewski said, and forms “an entire ecosystem in and of itself.”\n\n“There are probably thousands of different species that actually live in that leaf layer,” he said. \"Most of them are invertebrates, so think of everything from earthworms and little pillbugs and all sorts of little critters that live in that leaf layer. But also higher up the food chain, salamanders, toads, box turtles, shrews and chipmunks”\n\nCaterpillars, which provide food for birds, also often find a home in leaf layers.\n\n“So what happens if you get rid of every last leaf on your property? You’ve just swept away and bagged up and thrown into the landfill the food source that the birds are going to need to feed their babies,” Mizejewski said.\n\nSchlossberg also warned that if you were planning to blow leaves from your yard into the street, that can disrupt drains and local waters.\n\n“When you have foreign debris, they can clog the grates, and that can prevent water from moving off the surface of the street,” he said.\n\nLeaves can also end up in streams and rivers where drains lead. That can affect the water quality and “sensitive species adapted to those waterways,” Schlossberg said.\n\n“It’s a little bit like a trash dump, if you will, even though it’s natural organic material,” he said. “It still persists and can be problematic.”\n\n2,554-pounds:Massive pumpkin in New York breaks record as heaviest in US history\n\nWhen should I ever rake up leaves?\n\nIf the leaves on your lawn are forming a mat over your grass, experts agree that you can move them as the weather cools across the country.\n\nMizejewski recommended placing leaves in garden beds or raking them into a bigger pile and letting them “naturally compost there and break down.”\n\n“Don’t get rid of every last single leaf that falls onto your property, if you can. There’s great, easy things to do with them,” he said.\n\nSchlossberg urged people to rake up leaves or break them up with a lawnmower if you're expecting snow soon.\n\n\"Once there’s snow, you’re not going to mow, and that snow is really going to facilitate that matting, and that coverage is going to prevent the leaves from being displaced by winds. That’s the situation you really want to avoid,\" he said.\n\nBut whatever you plan to do with the leaves on your lawn, experts say, consider the plants and animals in your yard and the environment at large.\n\n“We each have an opportunity to do to take this personal action and think about how our own little piece of the Earth, our own yards or our own gardens in our neighborhoods or communities, are all opportunities for us to do something good for nature,” Mizejewski said.\n\nA version of this story was published in 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/09/22/halloween-costumes-2021-candy-decorations-spending-record/5816767001/", "title": "Halloween 2021 spending to hit record $10 billion on costumes, candy", "text": "Halloween is back on the schedule this year and we want trick-or-treaters, more decorations and new costumes – for us, the kids and our pets.\n\nConsumers are expected to spend a record $10.14 billion on Halloween this year, according to the National Retail Federation.

The 2020 Blue Wahoos baseball season was cancelled, along with all levels of Minor League Baseball, due to the pandemic.\n\nThe stadium became a place for graduations, proms, movie nights, dinner theme nights, as well as events like the recent First City Art Center Pumpkin Patch, which took advantage of the open space and sold out of 7,500 pumpkins.\n\nHaving the stadium converted from inflatable ramps and landing areas for Nitro Circus, then switched back early Friday morning into a football field setup was another first. The Nitro Circus had a massive crew, who immediately removed all equipment and enabled an easy transition for Saturday’s football game.\n\n“What I love the most this fall, in particular, is we have really branched out. We’ve gotten braver than ever before,” said Shannon Reeves, the Blue Wahoos events director. “I have gotten braver than ever before with hosting so many different events, which have brought in so many different demographics.\n\n“And many of the people have never been to the stadium for an event before. There were so many kids for the Nitro Circus. So many little boys and girls so excited about seeing what they saw on the field that night. It was new and different and we have never done anything like that before.”\n\nThe hope is the Nitro Circus will return. It was the largest attendance for an ticketed event outside of a baseball or football game in the stadium’s 10-year history.\n\nThe show traveled from Pensacola to Nashville, where it was staged Saturday at First Horizon Park, home of the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Nitro Circus then performed Sunday in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n“I think we took the first big step, which was to prove we could do it very well,” Reeves said. “I feel like we were hospitable and really represented who we are as the Blue Wahoos and Studer Family of Companies. I spoke to the tour manager and he was very happy. He said he couldn’t have imagined it going better.\n\n“I feel this was a bit of an audition for us here at the stadium and Pensacola. We came together as a team with all of us at the Blue Wahoos to make it happen.”\n\nUWF averaged 5,301 football fans in 2019 while going unbeaten at Blue Wahoos Stadium, which led into the Argos reaching the NCAA Division II playoffs for a second year and winning their history national championship. No team at any level in college football has won a national championship four years after starting the program.\n\nSaturday’s game was the first at the bayfront stadium in 701 days, following the cancellation of the team’s 2020 season due to COVID-19.\n\n“You know it’s going to be something special when we show up two hours before (kickoff) see all the people around,” said UWF coach Pete Shinnick. “I think there may have been only one other time where that many people were around two hours before.\n\n“When they announced 7,000, I was thinking oh my goodness, what a tremendous support for our program,” Shinnick said. “We are so thankful for that opportunity to play in that environment.”\n\nThe Argos will be back at Blue Wahoos Stadium on Saturday for a 4 p.m. conference game against Shorter University from Rome, Ga.\n\nFor Halloween weekend, the Blue Wahoos are hosting on Oct. 29 a Trick-or-Treat party for kids, followed by a Halloween-themed kids movie, plus a fireworks show after the movie. The event is sponsored by T-Mobile.\n\n“This is what we do,” Reeves said. “We love to see the different things coming here. We want the stadium to be a year-round place for the community and families to have fun.”\n\nBill Vilona is a retired Pensacola News Journal sports columnist and now senior writer for Pensacola Blue Wahoos.

Kansas voters rejected an amendment that would have removed the right to an abortion from the state’s constitution. This is the first time citizens have been able to weigh in on the issue at the polls since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the high turnout in Kansas could be a sign that voters will continue to show up to make their disagreement known. In Missouri, disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens lost his Republican primary after a controversial attempt to reenter politics. Several election deniers backed by former President Donald Trump were on the ballot in Arizona, Michigan and Washington. Some of these races are still too close to call, but Trump-backed Tudor Dixon is projected to become Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s challenger in November.\n\n2. United Nations\n\nSupreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson concluded her two days of questioning late yesterday, having spent about 22 hours this week being grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Throughout the hearings, Jackson has defended her experience and credentials as she faced criticism from Republican senators on her judicial philosophy and legal record. No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, but many Republican senators are expected to oppose the nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to vote on Judge Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination on Monday, April 4. In a 50-50 Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker to put Jackson on the high court.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Congress\n\nThe CEOs of 10 airlines and cargo carriers are urging Biden to end mask mandates and Covid-19 testing requirements for international travelers. In a letter to the president, the CEOs argue that federal travel restrictions – including international predeparture testing and the federal mask mandate – “are no longer aligned with the realities of the current epidemiological environment.” Earlier this month, the White House moved the end of the transportation mask mandate to April 18 and said government agencies would consult with the CDC to determine if the mandate could expire sooner. The CEOs of Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Atlas Air Worldwide, Delta Air Lines, FedEx Express, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and UPS Airlines all signed the letter.\n\n4. Trump revelations\n\nSeveral recent revelations have shed light on then-President Trump and his supporters’ plans to subvert the Constitution and keep him in power after the 2020 election. These revelations are likely to be of high interest to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. For instance, a newly revealed memo shows a conservative lawyer working with Trump’s legal team tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could overturn the election results on January 6 when Congress counted the Electoral College votes. The six-step scheme, which included throwing out electors from seven states, was outlined in a two-page memo obtained by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa for their book, “Peril.” The memo was then obtained by CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback NASA scrubs Artemis I rocket launch due to engine issues.

Immigration\n\nBritain’s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are on a weeklong royal tour of the Caribbean, having arrived Tuesday hours after protests were held calling on the monarchy to apologize and pay reparations for its historical role in the slave trade. Prince William and Kate are visiting Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas for a series of engagements to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s platinum jubilee year, marking 70 years on the throne. However, protests have overshadowed the trip and a royal engagement was canceled amid reported opposition from local residents. Britain and Jamaica’s relationship stretches back centuries. The island was seized by the British in 1655 and remained under its rule until it gained independence in 1962 but has stayed under the Queen as head of state. The majority of Jamaicans are of African ancestry and are the descendants of slaves trafficked to the country by European colonists.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nCMA Awards 2022: See who is nominated\n\nA woman used her smartwatch to call 911 after getting stuck in an interesting position at the gym.

His record was published in the Guinness World Records 2023 edition.\n\nSavannah cats like Fenrir are crosses between domestic cats and large-eared wild African cats, according to the International Cat Association. The cross gained popularity in the 1990s, and in 2001, the association accepted Savannahs as a registered breed.\n\nFenrir's owner is Michigan physician and HIV specialist Will Powers, the website said.

He also loves helping out at Powers' office to calm anxiety-ridden and stressed patients.\n\nHe's also \"ravenously\" hungry and has seen his diet limited because he's getting too big, Powers said in a video.\n\nAnd Fenrir's height helps him do things that others can't.\n\n\"When we were trying to take some pictures of him, we had to shut some of the other cats out of the of the room, and Fenrir decided he didn't want to be in the room anymore,\" he recalled. \"So he stood on his hind legs and opened the door.\"\n\nHe also snags things off the countertop if he spots them.\n\nHe's still growing, and some folks mistake the feline for a small panther, a puma, or an ocelot, Powers said.\n\n“This can actually scare people, and they back away from him in fear, but once I explain that he’s a therapy cat and very friendly, people are thrilled to walk up to him,” Powers told Guinness World Records.\n\nThe doctor admits he does everything for his cats, and even joked that his dad wants to be reincarnated as one of them because of how they're doted on.\n\nBut Powers realizes not all cats are so lucky. Because of that, he wants to use Fenrir's record to run charity events and raise money for stray and shelter cats in Detroit.\n\nPowers, who is president of a cat shelter and has six cats in total, said the cats have helped him a lot since the fire that took two his feline friends.\n\n\"They make my life well,\" he said. \"They've made me get well.

She was 90.\n\nLynn’s family said in a statement to CNN that she died Tuesday at her home in Tennessee.\n\n“Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,” the statement read.\n\nThey asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial will be announced later.\n\nLynn, who had no formal music training but spent hours every day singing her babies to sleep, was known to churn out fully textured songs in a matter of minutes. She just wrote what she knew.\n\nShe lived in poverty for much of her early life, began having kids by age 17 and spent years married to a man prone to drinking and philandering – all of which became material for her plainspoken songs. Lynn’s life was rich with experiences most country stars of the time hadn’t had for themselves – but her female fans knew them intimately.\n\n“So when I sing those country songs about women struggling to keep things going, you could say I’ve been there,” she wrote in her first memoir, “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” “Like I say, I know what it’s like to be pregnant and nervous and poor.”\n\nLynn scored hits with fiery songs like “Don’t Come Home A’ Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ On Your Mind)” and “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),” which topped the country charts in 1966 and made her the first female country singer to write a No. 1 hit.\n\nHer songs recounted family history, skewered lousy husbands and commiserated with women, wives and mothers everywhere. Her tell-it-like-it-is style saw tracks such as “Rated X” and “The Pill” banned from radio, even as they became beloved classics.\n\n“I wasn’t the first woman in country music,” Lynn told Esquire in 2007. “I was just the first one to stand up there and say what I thought, what life was about.”\n\nShe grew up dirt-poor in the Kentucky hills\n\nShe was born Loretta Webb in 1932, one of eight Webb children raised in Butcher Hollow in the Appalachian mining town of Van Lear, Kentucky. Growing up, Lynn sang in church and at home, even as her father protested that everyone in Butcher Hollow could hear.\n\nLoretta Lynn wears a cowboy hat and a fringe western style jacket while holding an acoustic guitar as she poses for a portrait in circa 1960 in Nashville, Tennessee.

But those early years were some of her fondest memories, as she recounts in her 1971 hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter”: “We were poor but we had love; That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of.”\n\nAs a young teenager, Loretta met the love of her life in Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn, whom she affectionately called “Doo.” The pair married when Lynn was 15 – a fact cleared up in 2012, after the Associated Press discovered Lynn was a few years older than she had said she was in her memoir – and Lynn gave birth to their first of six children the same year.\n\n“When I got married, I didn’t even know what pregnant meant,” said Lynn, who bore four children in the first four years of marriage and a set of twins years later.\n\n“I was five months pregnant when I went to the doctor, and he said, ‘You’re gonna have a baby.’ I said, ‘No way. I can’t have no baby.’ He said, ‘Ain’t you married?’ Yep. He said, ‘You sleep with your husband?’ Yep. ‘You’re gonna have a baby, Loretta. Believe me.’ And I did.”\n\nThe couple soon headed to Washington state in search of jobs. Music wasn’t a priority for the young mother at first. She’d spend her days working, mostly, picking strawberries in Washington state while her babies sat on a blanket nearby.\n\nBut when her husband heard her humming tunes and soothing their babies to sleep, he said she sounded better than the girl singers on the radio. He bought her a $17 Harmony guitar and got her a gig at a local tavern.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1960 that she’d record what would become her debut single, “Honky Tonk Girl.” She then took the song on the road, playing country music stations across the United States.\n\nAfter years of hard work and raising kids, telling stories with her guitar seemed like a break.\n\nLoretta Lynn performs in 2016 during South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Al Wagner/Invision/AP Prev Next\n\n“Singing was easy,” Lynn told NPR’s Terry Gross in 2010. “I thought ‘Gee whiz, this is an easy job.’ ”\n\nThe success of her first single landed Lynn on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and, soon, a contract with Decca Records. She quickly befriended country star Patsy Cline, who guided her through the fame and fashion of country stardom until her shocking death in a plane crash in 1963.\n\nCline “was my only girlfriend at the time. She took me under her wing, and when I lost her, it was something else. I still miss her to this day,” Lynn told The Denver Post in 2009. “I wrote ‘You Ain’t Woman Enough to Take My Man,’ and she said, ‘Loretta, that’s a damn hit.’ It shocked me, because you don’t expect somebody like Patsy Cline to tell you that you have a hit. Right after she passed, I put the record out, and it was a hit.”\n\nHer best-known songs drew from her life and marriage\n\nLynn’s struggle and success became the stuff of legend, an oft-repeated story of youth, naivete and poverty.\n\nFrom “Fist City” to “You’re Lookin’ at Country,” Lynn always sang from the heart, whether she was telling off a woman interested in Doo or honoring her Appalachian roots. But her music was far from conventional.\n\nShe rankled the conservative country establishment with songs like “Rated X,” about the stigma fun-loving women face after divorce, and “The Pill,” in which a woman toasts her newfound freedom thanks to birth control – “They didn’t have none of them pills when I was younger, or I’d have been swallowing them like popcorn,” Lynn wrote in her memoir.\n\nShe documented her upbringing in the bestselling 1976 memoir “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” co-written with George Vecsey. A 1980 biographical film by the same name won an Academy Award for actress Sissy Spacek and brought Lynn wider fame. Lynn’s success also helped launch the music careers of her sisters, Peggy Sue Wright and Crystal Gayle.\n\nLynn’s legend faced questions in 2012 when The Associated Press reported that in census records, a birth certificate and marriage license, Lynn was three years older than what most biographies stated. It didn’t mar Lynn’s success, but did make the oft-repeated tales of her teen marriage and motherhood less extreme.\n\n“I never, never thought about being a role model,” Lynn told the San Antonio Express-News in 2010. “I wrote from life, how things were in my life. I never could understand why others didn’t write down what they knew.”\n\nLynn always credited her husband with giving her the confidence to first step on stage as a young performer. She also spoke in interviews, and in her music, about the pain he caused over their nearly 50 years of marriage. Doolittle Lynn died in 1996 after years of complications from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nIn her 2002 memoir, “Still Woman Enough,” Lynn wrote that he was an alcoholic who cheated on her and beat her, even as she hit him back. But she stayed with him until his death and told NPR in 2010 that “he’s in there somewhere” in every song she wrote.\n\n“We fought one day and we’d love the next, so I mean … to me, that’s a good relationship,” she told NPR. “If you can’t fight, if you can’t tell each other what you think – why, your relationship ain’t much anyway.”\n\nLynn won numerous awards throughout her career, including three Grammys and many honors from the Academy of Country Music. She earned Grammys for her 1971 duet with Conway Twitty, “After the Fire is Gone,” and for the 2004 album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with Jack White of the White Stripes that introduced her to a new generation of fans.\n\nThen President Barack Obama awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Loretta Lynn in 2013. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nShe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and her song “Coal Miner’s Daughter” was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, and in 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Lynn “gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about.”\n\nHer career and legend only continued to grow in her later years as she recorded new songs, toured steadily and drew loyal audiences well into her 80s. A museum and dude ranch are dedicated to Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.\n\n“Working keeps you young,” she told Esquire in 2007. “I ain’t ever gonna stop. And when I do, it’s gonna be right on stage. That’ll be it.”\n\nLynn was hospitalized in 2017 after suffering a stroke at her home. The following year she broke a hip. Her health forced her to quit touring.\n\nIn early 2021, at the age of 89, she recorded her 50th album, “Still Woman Enough.”\n\nThe title song, which she sang alongside successors Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire, sounded like a mission statement that captures the ethos of her career:\n\n“I’m still woman enough, still got what it takes inside;\n\nI know how to love, lose, and survive;\n\nAin’t much I ain’t seen, I ain’t tried;\n\nI’ve been knocked down, but never out of the fight;\n\nI’m strong, but I’m tender;\n\nWise, but I’m tough;\n\nAnd let me tell you when it comes to love;\n\nI’m still woman enough.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht Scottie Andrew", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/10/04/loretta-lynn-dead-country-music-legend-coal-miners-daughter-singer/8175642001/", "title": "Loretta Lynn dead: Country singer, 'Coal Miner's Daughter' dies at 90", "text": "Peter Cooper\n\nThe (Nashville) Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. – Loretta Lynn, who rose from a hardscrabble upbringing to become the most culturally significant female singer-songwriter in country music history, has died. She was 90.\n\nLynn’s family said she died Tuesday at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.\n\n\"Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning (Oct. 4) in her sleep at home at her beloved ranch,\" her family said in a statement provided to USA TODAY.\n\nLynn was a mother of four when she launched her career in the early 1960s, and though many of her songs are filled with specifics of her wholly unique life, they had a universal appeal. She wrote about intimate matters – from her difficult, wearying childhood to fights with her husband – yet managed to strike a collective nerve.\n\nWithout ever mentioning politics or women’s liberation, her 1960s and 1970s hits helped change long-held notions about gender roles. “Rated ‘X’ ” and “Don’t Come Home A Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)” were personal pleas – not political treatises – that sought an end to double standards.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nLynn did all this at a time when women were most often the voices through which men’s words and melodies were heard. She was Nashville’s first prominent woman to write and record her own material and was one of the first female music stars to generate her own hits.\n\n'What a beautiful soul':Dolly Parton, LeAnn Rimes, more country stars remember Loretta Lynn\n\nWhen she was set to receive her Kennedy Center Honor in 2003, Lynn told The (Nashville) Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network, that she wasn’t sure why people found her culture-shaking songs so remarkable.\n\n“Cultural contributions? What’s that?” she asked. “I was just sayin’ it like I was livin’ it. People’d go around that, but I went right through the middle.”\n\nShe was the first woman named entertainer of the year at the genre’s two major awards shows, first by the Country Music Association in 1972 and then by the Academy of Country Music three years later.\n\nIn her 1970 smash hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” Lynn told the story of her upbringing, which helped her reach her widest audience yet.\n\nReview: Loretta Lynn remembers her friendship with Patsy Cline in heartfelt new memoir\n\n“We were poor but we had love / That’s the one thing Daddy made sure of / He shoveled coal to make a poor man’s dollar,” she sang.\n\n“Coal Miner’s Daughter,” also the title of her 1976 book, was made into a 1980 movie of the same name. Sissy Spacek’s portrayal of Lynn won her an Academy Award and the film was also nominated for best picture.\n\nLong after her commercial peak, Lynn won two Grammys in 2005 for her album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with rock star Jack White that featured 13 songs she wrote, including “Portland, Oregon” about a drunken one-night stand.\n\n“She is the single most important female singer-songwriter of the 20th century,” White told The Tennessean at the time.\n\nDolly Parton is in! Now it's time to get these country greats into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nBorn Loretta Webb, the second of eight children, she claimed her birthplace was Butcher Holler, near the coal mining company town of Van Lear in the mountains of eastern Kentucky. There really wasn’t a Butcher Holler, however. She made up the name for the purposes of the song, based on the names of the families that lived there.\n\nBefore Lynn’s ascendance into country music royalty, it wasn’t even on most maps. For Lynn, it was a place of hardship, poverty and danger.\n\nHer father, Ted, worked the night shift at the Consolidated Number Five mine, while her mother, Clara, tended to the eight kids and read books by a kerosene lamp until he came home. In her first autobiography, Lynn looked back on her father’s work as something heroic. “He kept his family alive by breaking his own body down,” she wrote.\n\nHer daddy played the banjo, her mama played the guitar and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family.\n\n'Sorry girls, he's taken now':Loretta Lynn and Kid Rock got 'married' over the weekend\n\nWhen Lynn was 13, she met Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn at a pie supper. He was 21, had served in the Army and already had a reputation for wildness. The two married in January 1948, when she was 15, and he took a job in the coal mine.\n\nTheir union was troubled from the start – he left her for another woman that same year, when Lynn was four months pregnant, then returned before she had their first child – but they remained married until his death in 1996.\n\nHe bought her a Sears & Roebuck guitar as a gift, encouraging her to play and sing, and she always credited him for her career in music. At first, she sounded too much like her idol, Kitty Wells, to be branded an original. But she had talent and conviction, and her blunt, truthful compositions began to set her apart from other female country singers. She wrote her first hit single, “I’m a Honky Tonk Girl,” released in 1960.\n\nThe Lynns drove across the U.S., visiting radio stations in hopes of gaining airplay for the single. (It peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard country singles chart.) When they reached Nashville in the fall, Lynn made a guest appearance on the \"Grand Ole Opry.\" She was 28.\n\nAudience reaction at the Opry was immediately positive, and Nashville saw something different in Lynn: a female singer-songwriter who strayed significantly from the prim, near-Victorian model of the time.\n\nShe scored top 10 hits with “Blue Kentucky Girl” and “Wine, Women and Song,” but it wasn’t until 1966 that she became recognized as a writer of import. In that watershed year, Lynn released “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)” and “Don’t Come Home A Drinkin’.” The former was a prideful rebuke to someone who threatened to bust up a marriage, the latter a strong, funny slice of life. Both were major hits.\n\n“At the time, girl singers were doing I-love-you-truly kinds of things, but I came in fightin’ over my man ’cause he was stepping out with somebody else,” she said in a 1980 \"Penthouse\" magazine interview.\n\nLynn wrote and recorded songs that weighed in on women’s roles in a changing America, including “The Pill,” which celebrated birth control as a sexual and social equalizer. Her songs insisted on something resembling fair play between the sexes, reaching a segment of the female population that found little sense in marches and bra burnings.\n\n“She was burning down walls between men and women,” White said.\n\nLynn also teamed up with singer Conway Twitty to form one of the most popular duos in country music with hits such as “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man” and “After the Fire is Gone,” which earned them a Grammy Award.\n\nShe moved to Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, outside of Nashville, in the 1990s, where she set up a ranch complete with a replica of her childhood home and a museum that is a popular roadside tourist stop.\n\nIn October 2010, Garth Brooks sang with Lynn at a Grammy Awards-sponsored celebration of her 50 years in music.\n\n“You just don’t forget where you come from,” she said at the celebration. “All I do is close my eyes, and I know where I’m from. I go back to that little old one-room cabin where I lived until I was 11.”\n\nHers was an unprecedented story that will be retold but not repeated.\n\n“God gives you life, and you do with it what you want to,” she told The Tennessean. “If you turn out bad, that’s up to you. If you turn out good, that’s up to you, also. But still, from the time I was born, I think he probably held my hand or held me in his arms. Or else I’d have never made it.\n\nContributing: Elise Brisco, USA TODAY, and Kristin M.

Her name will no doubt be cemented into eternal stardom alongside other country music institutions like Dolly Parton and Patsy Cline.\n\nAs country music’s biggest names mourn the loss of one of their own and offer up condolences to Lynn’s family, we take a look at her life – the movies and songs that made her famous and the family she built.\n\nRemembering her life and legacy:Country music icon Loretta Lynn dies at 90\n\nBeyond the music:How Loretta Lynn's defining hit 'Coal Miner's Daughter' became a classic movie biopic\n\nTributes for legend:Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, more country stars remember Loretta Lynn\n\nDid Loretta Lynn have children?\n\nYes.

But her place of birth is a state over in Kentucky.\n\nLynn is a daughter of Kentucky coal country. She claimed her birthplace as Butcher Hollow, or ‘Butcher Holler’ as she refers to it in the 1970 hit song “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Though the name was contrived for the song’s lyrics, the area itself, near Van Lear, a coal mining town in the mountains of east Kentucky, is real.\n\nLynn pays tribute to the area as well in the title track to her 2004 studio album \"Van Lear Rose\" which was produced by Jack White, a Lynn fan and a music icon in his own right.\n\nHow did Loretta Lynn die?\n\nNo specific cause of death has been given. Lynn's family shared in a statement that she died peacefully in her sleep at her Hurricane Milles ranch on Tuesday, Oct. 4.\n\nWhat movies is Loretta Lynn in?\n\nLynn's stardom transcended the music industry, reaching all the way to Hollywood. Though she did not star in the most famous movies to bear her name, the songs and stories she wrote and her persona as county music's leading lady became the subject of plenty of filmmaking.\n\nIn 1976 she penned “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” a memoir which went on to become a movie in 1980. Actress Sissy Spacek starred in the film and won an Oscar for her portrayal of Lynn. In 2019 Lifetime came out with another title \"Patsy and Loretta\" which chronicled the true story of a deep friendship between Lynn and fellow country music icon Patsy Cline.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/02/29/loretta-lynn-comes-full-circle-new-album/81110174/", "title": "Loretta Lynn comes full circle on new album", "text": "Juli Thanki\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee\n\nLoretta Lynn didn’t begin seriously writing songs until her mid-20s, later than many songwriters start honing their craft. By then, she was already the mother of four children younger than 10 and had relocated across the country from Butcher Holler, Ky., to Washington state with her husband, Doolittle.\n\nBut she more than made up for lost time and penned some of country music’s most enduring, unflinching classics, including the controversial single “Rated X,” the autobiographical “Coal Miner’s Daughter\" and feisty \"Fist City.\"\n\nNow 83, Lynn can still throw a punch.\n\nSix decades after she began writing lyrics, she went back to one of her first songs, “Whispering Sea,” and redid it for “Full Circle” (out Friday), her first new album since 2004's \"Van Lear Rose.\" Lynn didn’t spend those intervening years idle, though. Since 2007, she’s recorded more than 90 songs — produced by daughter Patsy Lynn Russell and John Carter Cash — at the Cash Cabin Studio in Hendersonville, including new original material, re-recorded versions of her hits and old favorites, such as \"In the Pines\" and \"I Will Never Marry,\" that she heard as a little girl in Butcher Holler.\n\n“I’m doing stuff that I’ve always wanted to sing, but never could because the label didn’t want me to do this or that,” Lynn explained.\n\n“This is the music of her heart,” Cash said. He’s known Lynn his entire life — she toured with his parents, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, and when the two of them were singing, Lynn was backstage holding baby John. Both of Cash's parents died in 2003, but when he began working with Lynn, he felt as though he was working with a cherished family member.\n\n“It was just like being in the studio with my mother. They had wit and charm and sense of humor, great depth of spirit and great faith in God,” he said.\n\nOn Friday, the same day “Full Circle” is released, PBS will air “Loretta Lynn: Still a Mountain Girl,” a two-hour documentary about Lynn’s life and career. The program is part of PBS’ American Masters series, which covers extraordinary artists, authors and actors. It will feature interviews with Lynn; her family members; Sissy Spacek, who played Lynn in the biopic “Coal Miner’s Daughter”; and a handful of the countless musicians who’ve admired her over the years, including Reba McEntire, Jack White (who produced Lynn’s 2004 album “Van Lear Rose”) and Miranda Lambert.\n\nAlthough her legacy as one of country music's greatest treasures is secured several times over, Lynn has no desire to park her tour bus or hang up the heavy, sparkly ballgowns she wears onstage. She'll keep singing, writing and working as long as people want to hear her. Just a couple weeks ago, she filmed a music video with Willie Nelson and recorded 11 more songs.\n\n“I don’t have to work now, but I do it because I love it,” she says.\n\n“I ain’t going nowhere.”\n\nTune in\n\nAmerican Masters' “Loretta Lynn: Still a Mountain Girl” will air at 8 p.m. Friday on WNPT.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/entertainment/gallery/loretta-lynn/index.html", "title": "Photos: Loretta Lynn, country music legend", "text": "Rich Fury/Invision/AP Loretta Lynn performs in 2016 during South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Lynn's life was rich with experiences most country stars of the time hadn't had for themselves, but her female fans knew them intimately.\n\n\"I wasn't the first woman in country music,\" she told Esquire in 2007. \"I was just the first one to stand up there and say what I thought, what life was about.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/10/04/loretta-lynn-death-country-music-tributes/8175795001/", "title": "Loretta Lynn tributes: Tanya Tucker, more mourn country legend", "text": "Musicians and celebrities are mourning the death of \"icon\" Loretta Lynn, a pioneer in the country genre.\n\nLynn died Tuesday at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, her family said in a statement provided to USA TODAY.

The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week. Water levels dropped by midday Saturday across the region, said Jonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The system forecasters are tracking is expected to bring elevated surf and strong winds to the Arctic coast Tuesday through Thursday, though water levels and winds weren’t expected to be as high as with the last storm, he said Sunday. There commonly are strong storms in northern and western Alaska between September and December, he said. But the storm that just hit parts of western and northwest Alaska and the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, which caused widespread damage in parts of western Alaska last month, were “exceptionally strong” for the areas that each impacted, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Abortions can take place again in the state, at least for now, after an appeals court on Friday blocked enforcement of a pre-statehood law that almost entirely criminalized the procedure. The three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed with Planned Parenthood that a judge should not have lifted the decades-old order that prevented the older law from being imposed. The brief order written by Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes. The judge struck down guidance the elections commission put in place six years ago, saying nothing in state law allows clerks to do that. The practice was unchallenged until Donald Trump lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in 2020. About 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots in that election.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Springs: Yellowstone National Park is postponing the opening of a renovated road at its north entrance as it continues to repair the damage from this summer’s catastrophic flooding, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}]}

Truss quipped following their removal that the “anti-growth coalition” had arrived at the hall “a bit too early.”\n\nGreenpeace confirmed that its activists were responsible for the protest.

In these tough times, we need to step up,” she also said.\n\n“I am determined to get Britain moving,” she added and “to put us on a strongest footing as a nation.”\n\nTruss criticized the “anti-growth coalition” that included “some of the people we had in the hall earlier.”\n\nShe added: “Economic growth makes us strong at home and strong abroad and we need an economically sound and secure United Kingdom and that will mean challenging those who try to stop growth.”\n\nThe prime minister was giving her speech as Conservative members of parliament voiced fears the combination of tax cuts along with huge public spending to help people cope with energy bills, rising inflation, rising interest rates and a falling pound are going to make winning the next general election impossible.\n\n“I will not allow the anti-growth coalition to hold us back,” Truss said. “Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier.\n\n“The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions.\n\n“They taxi from north London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo.\n\n“From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”\n\nTruss walked on to the conference stage to the music of 1990s hit, “Moving on Up,” by M People. Later, the group’s founder Mike Pickering tweeted his opposition to the use of the song by the Conservatives. “So apparently we can’t stop Truss walking out to our song, very weird!

The crowd was there to see a new club, Sporting Lagos FC, play its first-ever football match.\n\nThe match ended in a draw after Sporting Lagos equalized as a result of an own goal from Go Round FC, leaving supporters of the new club buzzing with excitement.\n\nThe club, which currently plays in the Nigerian National League, the country’s second-tier, is the brainchild of Shola Akinlade, co-founder and CEO of financial technology company Paystack, which he says was acquired for more than $200 million in 2020 by Irish American financial services company Stripe. Akinlade, who is also a tech investor, says he intends for Sporting Lagos to be a platform for community development and social change.\n\nFootball for change\n\nAkinlade told CNN that his motivation to create the football club came during a moment of self-reflection in 2021. “I lost my dad last year and I was looking at my 75-year-old mum, and it occurred to me that I need to build something that has staying power,” he said. “Football is one of those things because it is built around communities.”\n\nShola Akinlade is the co-founder and CEO of Paystack. courtesy Sporting Lagos FC\n\nHe says the goal of the club is to use football to create job opportunities for communities in Nigeria, and he plans to find young, untapped talents and train them to excel at the sport.\n\n“There are so many people that are born with these skills, but it doesn’t convert to opportunity,” Akinlade said. “So I want us to spend the next 30, 40 years building something that helps the next generation of football talents in Nigeria.”\n\nAkinlade pulled in some of his most influential friends as a brain trust – including ESPN journalist Colin Udoh and sports administrator Godwin Enakhena, both now part of the club’s governing body. “My brain cannot solve all these problems,” Akinlade said. “But if I have a lot of powerful brains solving the same problem, it will be helpful. I just shared it around and everyone just came up with their own ideas on how this could work.”\n\nSporting Lagos currently ranks third in the league, after ten games.\n\nInvesting in talent\n\nIn Nigeria, managing a football club is often challenging, and teams have to deal with problems including poor infrastructure, unpaid player salaries, and a lack of funding.\n\nNigerian sports journalist Tolu Olasoji says that clubs are mostly owned and run by the government, and are often lacking in structure. As a result, many that are run privately, struggle.\n\n“There is a lack of accountability in football clubs because the government doesn’t pay attention to how club money is spent or what football infrastructure to invest in,” said Olasoji. He added that “as a private individual in the football league who cares about making a profit or accountability, you will likely stay frustrated by the system.”\n\nSporting Lagos vs Nnewi United at the Teslim Balogun stadium, Lagos courtesy Sporting Lagos FC\n\nOlasoji thinks the lack of structure and accountability in Nigerian football will make things hard for Sporting Lagos, but he says the team is off to a good start. “He (Akinlade) has some of the best minds in Nigerian football on his team … and that creates the possibility for it to achieve its objectives,” he explained.\n\nAkinlade, who is the team’s main backer, says the club is trying to overcome infrastructure challenges by “building a football arena with security (and) assisted parking.” The tech entrepreneur says plans are also underway to create a football academy to train young talent, which he hopes to launch in the next few months, starting with 11 to 15-year-olds. “We will be getting them the best coaches and sending them to the best schools as a way of developing their talents,” he added.\n\nFans of Sporting Lagos FC cheering on the club against Nnewi United, in March. courtesy Sporting Lagos FC\n\nThe tech factor\n\nSporting Lagos has the support of several other tech-based companies besides Paystack, with its matches sponsored by brands such as Abeg, PiggyVest, Renmoney and Helium Health.\n\nAkinlade says a lot of tech-based companies are trying to find new platforms to promote their products and services. Sports, he said, has become one of those places. “I think for platforms like Abeg and PiggyVest supporting us, it’s also about figuring out how to use this as a platform, either for footballers or the football ecosystem,” he told CNN.\n\nAkinlade says his dream for the club is “to move to the first division of Nigerian football and have players come out of Sporting Lagos play in the World Cup.”", "authors": ["Aisha Salaudeen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/business/why-ikea-sells-meatballs/index.html", "title": "Ikea's restaurants were failing. Then it turned to Swedish meatballs ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIkea is known for sprawling showrooms, cheap flat-pack furniture and, of course, Swedish meatballs.\n\nThe retail giant sells more than a billion of its trademark Swedish meatballs at cafeterias in stores every year. The meatballs have become a symbol of Ikea’s friendly Scandinavian brand image and central to the retailer’s strategy of keeping customers browsing inside stores for hours — and getting them to pick up a new bed or couch after they finish eating.\n\nMeatballs are “the best sofa-seller,” Gerd Diewald, who led Ikea’s US food operations at the time, said in a 2017 interview.\n\nBut meatballs weren’t on the menu when Ikea opened its first in-store cafe in 1953 in Älmhult, Sweden. There was just coffee and cake. As Ikea grew, it started offering traditional Swedish dishes such as potato mash and sausage. Still no meatballs for a while, though.\n\nIkea sells more than 1 billion meatballs annually. Johannes Cleris/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIkea finally debuted its meatballs in 1985, following an overhaul of its menu and restaurant operations.\n\nBut the masterminds of Ikea’s meatballs never expected them to become a sensation.\n\n“I would never have imagined 40 years later people would be calling me about it,” said Sören Hullberg, who led Ikea’s food revamp at the time.\n\nIn fact, suppliers Ikea approached to produce its meatballs were skeptical of its plan, Hullberg said: “Why should a furniture dealer suddenly buy meatballs and send them across the world?”\n\nLanding on meatballs\n\nIkea turned to meatballs after it faced struggles selling food.\n\nCompany founder Ingvar Kamprad, who started Ikea as a mail-order company (Ikea’s name comes from his initials and the farm and village where he grew up in Sweden), felt that the company’s restaurants were a “mess,” Hullberg said. “He was not happy with the quality and the image.”\n\nAt the time, Ikea had around 50 stores worldwide. Kamprad worried that Ikea was losing customers who were getting hungry while they wandered around Ikea’s maze-like stores and leaving to grab a bite to eat.\n\nKamprad, who died in 2018, envisioned restaurants in stores as a place where customers could sit down, eat and plan how to decorate their living rooms with Ikea wares.\n\nHullberg, then an Ikea store manager, had gotten close to Kamprad and was tapped to create a new concept for all of Ikea’s restaurants — everything from kitchen lines to the menu to training staff. He and a team of four, including a chef recruited from a high-end restaurant in Stockholm, went to work on designing a restaurant that would be an extension of Ikea’s Swedish brand identity and thrifty reputation.\n\nThe meatballs were not Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad's idea. Ola Torkelsson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Our mission was to make sure that no one left an Ikea store because of being thirsty or hungry,” he said.\n\nAt the time, a typical Ikea store was serving up to 5,000 customers a day. To simplify operations and keep costs down, the menu would have to be limited. And since the menu would be similar at stores in different countries, Hullberg’s team looked for foods that were popular across different cultures.\n\nMeatballs, a mainstay of Swedish diets, fit the bill.\n\n“We were hooked on that one,” he said. “Even if it’s not really a Swedish innovation, meatballs exist in every culture you come to.”\n\nMeatballs were also efficient to freeze, transport and quickly prepare at Ikea’s kitchens.\n\nAlthough in Sweden “there are as many recipes of meatballs as there are people eating them,” Ikea needed to land on one recipe since it was outsourcing production. Making them in-house would have been too complicated for the volumes Ikea needed.\n\nIkea’s chef came up with a recipe that was two-thirds beef and one-third pork, but Kamprad, the founder, wanted the meatball to be primarily from pigs.\n\n“We won that battle because it was easier to export meatballs containing a majority of beef than pig,” Hullberg said.\n\nIn addition to meatballs, the new menu also featured Swedish staples such as salmon and roast beef, and smaller plates like salads and sandwiches.\n\nHullberg, 71, left Ikea in 1992. But he still shops there and stops by the restaurant to check out his brainchild.\n\n‘Iconic for IKEA’\n\nToday, Ikea has several meatballs — the original one, chicken, salmon, vegetarian and a newer plant-based meatball. They’re served with mashed potatoes, cream sauce, lingonberry jam and vegetables. Ikea also sells frozen meatballs customers can take home.\n\nThe meatballs survived a damaging recall in 2013 after traces of horse meat were found in a batch in Europe. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ikea shut down its restaurants and released the recipe for customers to cook them at home.\n\nThe cafeterias where meatballs are typically served are located near the middle of the store — not too close to the entrance or the exit.\n\nThere’s a strategy involved here, according Alison Jing Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management who studies consumer behavior and the impact hunger has on purchasing decisions.\n\nIkea doesn’t want to feed you right away, instead preferring that you work up an appetite while you shop and then visit the restaurant to take a break, Xu said.\n\nWhen you’re hungry, your mind is focused on acquiring food. This can spill over into acquiring other products, she said. Xu’s research has found that hungry mall shoppers spent 64% more money than shoppers who were already full.\n\nWhen Tiare Sol, an Ikea shopper in Sacramento, California, and her family visit the store, “almost everyone ends up ordering the meatballs.”\n\n“They’re delicious,” she said. “They have a plant-based one which is nice because I’ve been trying to cut down on eating meat and dairy.”\n\nFor Sol, eating Swedish meatballs at Ikea is part of the experience: “The meatballs are kind of iconic for Ikea.

Martin expected the effort to inspire some smiles and maybe lift a few hundred spirits in Healdsburg and the surrounding community. In less than a week, the project has gone viral, receiving between 300 and 500 calls an hour, and up to as many as 5,000 calls a day, Martin said.\n\n“The adults among us have been holding everything up for so long, it’s amazing to see what comfort children can bring,” she said. “I was moved by the incredible collection of advice and encouragement they gleaned, and how easily and distinctly they were able to communicate it.”\n\nWords of encouragement and advice\n\nAll the recordings feature children, in their own voices.\n\nFeeling frustrated?

She said she was proud of them and impressed by their compassion and love for each other and the world at large.\n\n“When I called the hotline, I smiled, laughed out loud, and teared up,” she wrote in an email.\n\n‘Straight from the literal mouths of babes’\n\nMembers of the local community have embraced the project in a big way – sharing information about it on social media and encouraging kids to put up signs advertising it all over town.\n\nEvin Alexander, whose 11-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son participated in the recordings, said she has found herself calling the hotline repeatedly over the last few days to help stay sane amid Russia’s war in Ukraine and changing mask mandates in California schools.\n\n“With the masks and everything going on in the world and in my personal life, it’s been really moving and heartwarming to hear words of encouragement and love,” Alexander said. “While adults might say these things, hearing them in the innocent voices of our kids makes it seem like maybe it’s going to be OK. Those voices give me hope.”\n\nWest Side’s “Peptoc Hotline” also has touched those outside of California’s wine country.\n\nAmy McWilliams, who lives in Mission Viejo, California, said a friend sent her the number. McWilliams, who has stage 4 malignant melanoma, has called it several times and shared the line with fellow cancer patients to help them endure rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n“It’s joy, straight from the literal mouths of babes,” she said of the recordings. “We adults forget that spreading kindness and positive thinking can really be that simple.”\n\nMartin was inspired for the project by the “social practice” art movement and the work of the late Susan O’Malley, who gave pep talks, asked for advice from strangers and installed inspirational posters in public.\n\nArtist and teacher Jessica Martin recorded the students' messages in her art enrichment class. Sebastien Pochan, Courtesy Jessica Martin\n\nThe name for the project came from Martin’s 6-year-old son. Once the artist had captured all the recordings, she asked her son to use his special block letters to create a flyer to advertise the hotline. She purposely gave him no direction beyond what she thought would be the name: “Peptalk.” He sounded out the words and mistakenly spelled them as “Peptoc,” which Martin loved for its honesty and unintentional reference to TikTok. The name stuck.\n\nAs of press time, Meechan, the principal, said the district planned to keep the hotline running through the end of the school year. Martin noted she was in the process of seeking outside funding to keep it running long beyond then.\n\n“One of my missions in the art program for the school is to introduce kids to the broadest approach to creative practice as possible,” Martin said. “Yes, we’re doing painting and drawing, but it’s important that these kids also are being exposed to art by artists who are pushing definitions of what art is and the role it plays in our society.”", "authors": ["Matt Villano"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2017/12/24/museum-bible-debuts-nations-capital/978114001/", "title": "Museum of the Bible opens in Washington, D.C.", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C.—Jeffrey Gladney teaches the Old Testament at Northeast Mississippi Community College in Tupelo, Miss.\n\nTo celebrate the holiday season, he brought his wife and children to the new Museum of the Bible in the nation’s capital—a 430,000-square-foot interactive experience that tells the history and impact of the Old and New Testaments.\n\n“It’s like a refresher course to me,” he says. “It helps us have a visual image of what happened during the life of Jesus.”\n\nThe $500 million museum opened with much fanfare last month just two blocks from the National Mall and three blocks from the U.S. Capitol.

Each stone marks the name of one of the tribes.\n\n“You walk through the story of the Old Testament. It’s very evocative,” says Andrea Verbrugge, a Silver Spring, Md. resident. “You utilize all your senses.”\n\nThe New Testament exhibit has a theater with a movie. Next to that is the Word of Jesus of Nazareth, which recreates a first century village, complete with actors in the role of villagers talking about life during Jesus’ ministry.\n\nWooden plaques on trees describe daily life back then, including how villagers harvested grape for wine, how shepards tended to their flocks of sheep, and what meals were like.\n\nAn actor calling himself Jeremiah invites visitors into a structure built to look like a synagogue.\n\n“We came here to read the Torah,” he explains. “This is a teaching place.”\n\nGladney and his family listen intently to the actor.\n\n“I like how they act,” says his son Joshua, 9. “They had clothes like them. They talked like them. They asked a lot of questions.”\n\nSays his father, also a reverend at Red Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church: \"The Bible pertains to every area of life and the Bible Museum helped to reinforce that theology.\"\n\nFloor two has the Impact of the Bible galleries. “Introduced to the Americas by generations of immigrants, the Bible has had a profound impact on American history, culture, and politics,” a sign for the Impact of the Bible in America section says.\n\n\"It was a great reminder to see the roles the Bible has played in shaping the world,\" Brown says. \"It's not something that we think of on a regular basis, although we know the importance of religious freedoms.\"\n\nMuch of the exhibit focuses on the Bible’s role in helping to end slavery and to encourage the Civil Rights movement.\n\nA replica of the Liberty Bell has a verse from Leviticus circling the top: \"Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.\"\n\nThe Impact of the Bible in the World section has displays on the Bible’s impact on human rights, health, math, science, art, architecture, music, stage and screen, language, and more.\n\nThere are even dresses from designers such as Alexander McQueen, Jean Paul Gaultier and Gianni Versace.\n\nThe first floor has the Children’s Experience plus an exhibit with items borrowed from the Vatican Museums and the Vatican Library.\n\nThe basement houses temporary exhibits. Among them is one about how John Newton wrote the song “Amazing Grace” and another with sculptures by Gib Singleton depicting the 14 Stations of the Cross.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/01/women-baseball-lynyrd-skynyrd-circus-fire-news-around-states/39646053/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nChatom: The local Ford dealership has ended a Fourth of July promotion that gave a Bible, American flag and gift certificate for a 12-gauge shotgun to anyone who bought a new or used vehicle. News outlets report Ford Motor Co. told Ford Chatom that the promotion was inappropriate after a worker fired from a California dealership killed two employees last week before killing himself. Dealership general manager Colin Ward says he’s disappointed the automaker requested the promotion be ended. He says the dealership is fulfilling any commitments it already made. Ward says customers could have received a Torah or Quran instead of a Bible if they wanted during the “God, guns and freedom” promotion. Ford Motor Co. spokesman T.R. Reid says the company wasn’t involved in developing the local promotion.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern Alaska coastal communities and climate scientists say sea ice disappeared far earlier than normal this spring, and it’s affecting wildlife. The Anchorage Daily News reports ice melted because of exceptionally warm ocean temperatures. Janet Mitchell of Kivalina says hunters used to be able to find bearded seals on sea ice just outside the village. This year, family hunters traveled more than 50 miles by boat to find bearded seals in early June. The hunters ran out of gas on their way back and had to call other residents to bring them more fuel. University of Alaska Fairbanks climatologist Rick Thoman says sea surface temperatures last week in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas were as high as 9 degrees above the 1981-2010 average.\n\nArizona\n\nYarnell: Nineteen bells rang and 19 names were spoken aloud amid somber silence Sunday afternoon in this town at the edge of a wildfire that killed 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters six years ago. Every year since, on June 30, Prescott and Yarnell have remembered the 19 men, casualties of the deadliest U.S. wildland fire in 80 years. The Yarnell Hill Fire, which began June 28, 2013, burned across 8,400 acres and ruined more than 100 structures. At the Yarnell Hill Fire Memorial Park on Sunday, nearly 200 people assembled in a dirt enclosure that is hoped to become a park dedicated to the Hotshots and the fire they battled. Simultaneously in Prescott, the home base for the firefighters, community members gathered in the town square as the Yavapai County Courthouse rang its bell 19 times.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: Sports wagering has begun in the state, with the first bets being placed at a Hot Springs casino. Spokeswoman Jennifer Hoyt said in a statement that Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort began offering sports wagering Monday morning and will allow gamblers to bet on games ranging from professional football and college basketball to cricket and rugby. Hoyt said bets can be placed with tellers seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or at kiosks at the casino. The Arkansas Racing Commission approved sportsbook wagering at Oaklawn last month. In March, the commission approved full casino licenses for Oaklawn and Southland Gaming and Racing in West Memphis.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A $2 billion transit terminal that shut down shortly after its inauguration last year has partially reopened. The terminal’s lobby and its 5.4-acre rooftop park reopened Monday to the public, but bus service won’t resume until later this summer. KPIX-TV reports officials say programs and activities, including live music, yoga and activities for kids, will restart this week. The terminal called the Salesforce Transit Center opened Aug. 12, 2018, to great fanfare. Officials closed the terminal in September after finding two cracked beams. The new center replaced the grim and seismically deficient Transbay Terminal nearby. It is meant to be a modern transportation hub with food trucks, pop-up retail shops and a rooftop park.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Five years after the recreational use of marijuana was legalized, the state has surpassed $1 billion in tax revenue from pot sales. The Colorado Department of Revenue announced last month that sales since legalization had topped $6.5 billion. The state has more than 2,900 licensed marijuana businesses and more than 41,000 licensed workers in the industry. “This industry is helping grow our economy by creating jobs and generating valuable revenue,” Gov. Jared Polis said. The Denver Post reports marijuana revenue funds a variety of public health programs, including mental health services, youth literacy initiatives and anti-bullying programs in schools. The tax revenue goes to state and local governments. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is planning a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of what has become known as the Day the Clowns Cried, when more than 150 people died in a big-top fire. The remembrance ceremony for the Hartford Circus Fire will take place July 6 at the memorial site on Barbour Street. An estimated 7,000 people were attending the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1944 when the big top caught fire. The blaze spread quickly, fueled by a mixture of gasoline and paraffin wax that was used to waterproof the tent. The death toll has been put at various times between 167 and 169 people. More than 700 were injured, many of them children. The cause of the fire has never been determined.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers have given final approval to a bill expanding the state’s decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana to juveniles. Lawmakers voted 34 to 7 for the bill Sunday, the last day of this year’s legislative session. The measure now goes to Democratic Gov. John Carney for his signature. Possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is currently a civil violation for anyone over 21 but a criminal misdemeanor for those under 18. Nineteen- and 20-year-olds are subject to a civil violation for a first offense but misdemeanor charges for a second or subsequent offense. The bill makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil violation for a first offense in all cases. A third or subsequent offense would subject anyone under 21 to a misdemeanor criminal charge.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A court has ordered police in the nation’s capital to start tracking the race of everyone stopped by officers, regardless of whether the stop results in an arrest or search. News outlets report the Thursday ruling gives the department a month to comply. The D.C. Council passed legislation three years ago that required the department to track race, but it never followed through. Advocacy groups sued the department, its chief and city officials last year over the noncompliance with the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results act. Chief Peter Newsham says the department planned to implement IT upgrades to comply by next month, regardless of the court order. Superior Court Judge John M. Campbell questioned why a short-term, low-tech measure wasn’t put in place to collect the required data in the meantime.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: An LGBTQ organization has suspended its director while it investigates why four men charged with hate crimes in an anti-gay attack attended the group’s gay pride gala. In a Sunday statement, the Miami-based nonprofit SAVE said it has placed director Tony Lima on administrative leave. Lima said in a Facebook video that the men bought their own tickets after volunteering with the group, but he didn’t consult with board members before welcoming them in his remarks. The South Florida Gay News publication said Lima announced on stage that the men had been “wrongly accused.” Lima said he doesn’t remember saying that, but “if that’s what I said in haste, I apologize.” The four men are accused of attacking two men and shouting anti-gay slurs following last year’s Miami Beach gay pride parade.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Scientists say a warm winter may have given a head start to a shrimp-killing parasite. The Savannah Morning News reports researchers found a shrimp with black gills during a June 21 cruise. Shrimp with black gills are infected with a parasite that can weaken or kill them, especially as water grows warmer and holds less oxygen. Marc Frischer of the University of Georgia’s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography says it’s only the second time that shrimp with visible black gill have been observed in June. He says live shrimp collected are also dying at a high rate “suggesting that we are in the midst of a mortality event.” Frischer says warmer winters, possibly caused by climate change, appear to lead to smaller shrimp catches the following fall.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: A new two-day festival on Kauai aims to explore the influences traditional Hawaiian music has had on traditional folk music, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports. The Kauai Folk Festival, scheduled for Sept. 28-29 in Lihue, is the brainchild of Matt Morelock, a multi-instrumentalist best known as a banjo player. Morelock, who was raised on bluegrass and country music and previously produced a live-performance radio show called the “WDVX Blue Plate Special” in Knoxville, Tennessee, has been trying to grow Kauai’s folk music scene since he and his wife, Hollis Church, moved to Moloaa on the northeastern part of the island eight years ago. While Morelock said it’s commonly known Hawaiians invented Hawaiian-style steel guitar playing, he’s identified other connections, including Hawaiian-style vocal harmonies and yodeling.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador has been elected chairman of the state Republican Party. He defeated former Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna by a 111-109 vote Saturday. The chairman is responsible primarily for overseeing the party’s goals of electing Republicans and developing a political game plan for elections. “Let’s stand united, and let’s do the things that are necessary to defeat the real enemy, which is the bad ideas of the other side,” Labrador said. He said more people are moving to Idaho and possibly bringing different views. “You see what’s happening on that national stage, and that stage is moving to the state of Idaho,” he said. Labrador served as a U.S. congressman starting in 2010. He left that position to run for governor in 2018 but lost to now-Gov. Brad Little in the Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Officials in this city home to the women’s baseball team that inspired the 1992 film “A League of Their Own” want to help fund a $7 million museum honoring the role of women in the sport’s history. The city of Rockford’s planning committee agreed last week to provide $20,000 to help kick off construction of the International Women’s Baseball Center. The Rockford Register Star reports that the City Council will likely vote on the plan this week. The museum, hall of fame and training facility will be located near the stadium where the Rockford Peaches played in the 1940s and 1950s as part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The first exhibit will be dedicated to Penny Marshall, who directed the film starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Several new state laws have been set in motion with July’s arrival, from a required high school state government test to allowing wrongfully incarcerated individuals to collect $50,000 a year. Starting Monday, Indiana high schools will have to administer, as part of a mandatory government course, the U.S. naturalization test that’s given to immigrants hoping to become U.S. citizens. An initial plan had proposed that students had to pass the test to earn a high school diploma, but that plan was scrapped. Other new laws include making people who are wrongfully incarcerated eligible to receive $50,000 for each year behind bars once a conviction is vacated due to innocence. Also, the head of the Indiana Department of Education will now be appointed by the governor, starting in 2021.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A summer tradition entering its 28th year will overtake the Iowa State Fairgrounds this week, with more than 4,000 hot rods, muscle cars and other custom rides all on display. The Goodguys Heartland Nationals will run Friday through Sunday, providing visitors with a close-up look at thousands of unique rides produced before 1987. The Des Moines event is one of 18 held nationally by California-based Goodguys Rod & Custom Association. For those needing extra horsepower in their holiday, multiple racing competitions will be held during the three-day event. Cars registered in the show are eligible to compete. There’s also no shortage of traditional summertime family fun, including an apple pie bake-off, watermelon eating competition, live entertainment and July Fourth fireworks.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: State agricultural officials are considering a quarantine to slow the spread of an invasive plant threatening native grasses. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the Kansas Department of Agriculture recently sought public input on a plan to quarantine invasive yellow and Caucasian bluestem grasses. The varieties have invaded all but three counties in the Sunflower State. Declaring the quarantine would prohibit the movement of all seeds, plants or parts of bluestem grasses within or into the state. The move could affect some ranchers who rely on the species when cutting hay to feed livestock. Ron Klataske, who leads environmental nonprofit Audubon of Kansas, supports the proposal, saying bluestems destroy all native plants. Kansas Livestock Association Attorney Aaron Popelka says the group opposes the plan because it could economically hurt producers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: More than two dozen Catholic school students and their parents have lost an initial appeal in challenging a regional health department’s efforts to control a chickenpox outbreak. The students claim the agency’s actions infringed on their religious beliefs. But a three-judge panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals sided with a trial court judge who ruled in April that the Northern Kentucky Health Department acted within its authority. The health agency canceled extracurricular activities and later imposed a temporary ban on school attendance for unvaccinated students as the chickenpox outbreak spread. Last week’s ruling applied to the refusal to impose a temporary injunction on behalf of the Catholic school students and their parents. Their attorney says they’ll appeal to the state Supreme Court.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A NASA official says some crews are working around the clock at the space agency’s rocket factory in the city to meet a fall 2020 test launch deadline for a mega-rocket designed to propel astronauts toward the moon and Mars. Deputy Administrator James Morhard says he recently visited the Michoud Assembly Facility at midnight, and people were working on the engine section for the 212-foot core of the Space Launch System. The other four sections have been assembled, and NASA says the rocket’s core section is 80% complete. Morhard wouldn’t say whether he expects NASA to get the $1.6 billion requested by President Donald Trump for space exploration. He says he’s waiting to see what the Senate does with the proposal.\n\nMaine\n\nEllsworth: Supporters of the sea urchin industry say a federal law change will make it easier to ship the seafood out of state. Maine is the site of a fishery for sea urchins, which are harvested so their roe can be used as food. But members of the industry and some lawmakers have charged over the years that burdensome inspection regulations make it difficult to ship the product where it needs to go. Former Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin and current Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree are among the lawmakers who have called for an ease on those burdens, which sometimes result in the seafood spoiling while awaiting inspections. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says in the Federal Register that it’s amending regulations about importation and exportation of urchins to address the problem.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has suspended a Baltimore judge for six months without pay for “a pattern of discourtesy and uncontrollable incivility.” Judge Devy Patterson Russell’s suspension began Monday. Maryland Court of Appeals Judge Clayton Greene wrote that her behavior “had pervasive effects on the administration of justice.” He wrote that from 2007 to 2015, Russell failed to handle and process search warrant materials properly. Greene also wrote that she instructed a law clerk to destroy warrant materials and repeatedly yelled at court clerks and judges. Greene wrote that Russell’s reinstatement is based on finishing “a complete emotional and behavioral assessment” by a qualified health care professional. Russell has denied wrongdoing, contending the matter amounted to personality disputes that were not sanctionable.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLenox: The Boston Symphony Orchestra’s summer home at Tanglewood has unveiled one of the most transformative new additions in its history. Officials on Friday held a ceremonial ribbon-cutting on the $33 million, four-building Linde Center for Music and Learning. The climate-controlled facility will play an essential role in establishing the 500-plus-acre Tanglewood campus in Lenox and Stockbridge as a year-round facility for the first time in its 80-year history. It includes studio, rehearsal and performance space, including one that can seat up to 270 people. It’s the largest building project at Tanglewood in 25 years since the construction of Seiji Ozawa Hall. It is named for lead donor Joyce Linde, her late husband, Edward, and their family.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Aging care experts are warning that the state’s safety net services for elderly populations are becoming strained as more residents live longer. The Detroit News’ analysis of recently released U.S. Census Bureau data shows that Michigan’s overall population has a median age of nearly 40 years. In 21 of the state’s counties, the median age tops 50 years. Area Agency on Aging of Northwestern Michigan serves some of those counties, and the Traverse City-based nonprofit’s executive director, Heidi Gustine, cautions that the state is about to reach a tipping point, as more baby boomers reach retirement age. Gustine says safety net systems are already buckling as demand for home health care increases with fewer workers to fill the jobs. Aging organizations also need more funding and affordable senior housing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEagan: Parents in the state are complaining that they face long waits and have to drive long distances so their teens can take their driver’s license road tests. Cheree Johnson of Rockford told KSTP-TV she and her 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, had to drive an hour to Eagan to take the test recently because a closer location was booked until October. The Eagan office is now booked into October, too. Other young drivers from the Twin Cities have had to travel more than 100 miles to take their tests. State Rep. Jon Koznick says it shouldn’t be so frustrating. He’s considering whether the Legislature should do something about it next session. Driver and Vehicle Services says it has 110 examiners across Minnesota, with plans to hire seven more.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: People are raising money for two Mississippi Blues Trail markers to commemorate the 1977 plane crash that killed three members of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, their road manager and two pilots. The Enterprise-Journal reports the markers will be unveiled in October – one near the crash site in Gillsburg and the other at Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center in McComb, where survivors were treated. Mike Rounsaville, a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan from northern Mississippi, is raising money, and a GoFundMe page had nearly reached a $10,000 goal by last week. The Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center Foundation is also collecting donations. Lynyrd Skynyrd was founded in Florida and is known for hits such as “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Free Bird.” The current iteration of the band is touring Europe and the U.S. this year.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources has received an $8.6 million federal grant for a new research center. The university announced last week that it had received the grant from the National Institute of Health. The five-year grant will go toward the Swine Somatic Genome Editing Center, where researchers from across the country will use wild pigs to develop delivery methods for gene-editing compounds. The Columbia Missourian reports the center is the latest addition to NIH’s Somatic Cell Gene Editing Consortium, which researches tools for genome editing in human patients. The center will operate out of an existing university research facility after it is renovated to meet federal standards.\n\nMontana\n\nMoiese: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service diverted roughly a third of the National Bison Range Complex’s budget in 2015 and never gave it back. The shrunken budget hobbled staff, slashed Visitor Center hours, and left buildings in disrepair at a place often referred to as the crown jewel of the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System. A 10-month investigation by the Missoulian charted a years­long funding crunch at this group of National Wildlife Refuges. Fish and Wildlife Service financial records indicate the Bison Range Complex’s annual budget dropped from as much as $2.7 million from 2012 to 2014 to as little as $1.2 million in the years since. By May 2017, Bison Range manager Jeff King was warning his superiors that “we are (past) the muscle and bone and into the marrow on our ability to even manage our highest priorities, and even those things are suffering.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Voters may decide next year whether to legalize casino gambling in a ballot measure that could tip the number of states that allow commercial gambling into the majority. Supporters of legalized casinos have launched a petition drive to place the issue on the 2020 ballot with financial backing from the economic development corporation owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Twenty-five states – including neighboring Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota – allow commercial casino gambling with games such as slot machines, craps and roulette wheels, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Iowa casinos near Omaha, in particular, cater to Nebraska residents looking to gamble. “Hundreds of millions of dollars go across the border every year,” said Lance Morgan, the CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc., the corporation pushing the measure on the tribe’s behalf.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The state has become the latest to honor the sacrifices of servicemen and servicewomen killed in military service. The Gold Star Families Memorial was dedicated Saturday on the grounds of the recently opened Northern Nevada State Veterans Home in Sparks. The Nevada Appeal reports the black granite memorial has one side for a tribute to Gold Star Families and the other to tell a story on four panels of Homeland, Family, Patriot and Sacrifice. Among the speakers at the event was 96-year-old Hershel “Woody” Williams, a former Marine who earned a Medal of Honor for his heroism at the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Williams said the U.S. has done a good job of recognizing veterans but a very poor job in honoring the families until now.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBretton Woods: The Mount Washington Cog Railway is about to mark its 150th anniversary. Festivities for the July 3 birthday of the world’s first mountain-climbing cog railway are scheduled at the base station from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. There will be a guest booth with goodies from Calef’s General Store in Barrington, a partner property celebrating its own 150th anniversary. There also will be barbecue and birthday cupcakes from local businesses. The day also will include Victorian lawn games and fish feeding at Peppersass Pond, plus a live acoustic guitar performance by Michael Bloom and fireworks at dusk by Andrew Day.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state will consider expanding its beach access regulations to take into account two things every day-tripping beachgoer knows: Being able to access a beach also includes being able to park near it and use a public restroom. Catherine McCabe, the state’s environmental protection commissioner, says her department will take a renewed look later this year at beach access, including the issues of parking and restrooms. Under the administration of former Gov. Jon Corzine, New Jersey required public access points every quarter-mile, plus public restrooms in any shore town that accepted government money for beach replenishment. Those rules were struck down by a court in 2008. The state recently enshrined the Public Trust Doctrine into law, establishing the public’s right to swim in waterways and walk along their shorelines.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The effects of a progressive shift in the state are being felt as new laws take effect that restrict gun access, raise taxes, decriminalize low-level drug possession, and provide a major boost in spending on everything from teacher salaries to road construction. Starting Monday, taxes on vehicle sales rose by 33%. Background checks are required for nearly all firearms purchases, and smaller public bathrooms are becoming gender-neutral. The state also is raising its salaries and channeling more money toward public education initiatives to help at-risk students in response to a court order mandating greater school resources. A windfall from the oil sector will help with increased government spending, as the industry is expected to provide the state with a $1 billion surplus for a second consecutive year.\n\nNew York\n\nHyde Park: Renovations are planned next year at President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s historic home on the Hudson River. The National Historic Site mansion will be closed to tours from April through October 2020 as the building undergoes extensive renovations. The Poughkeepsie Journal reports that the project will include a replacement of the heating and air-conditioning system and exterior painting. It’s slated to cost more than $3.2 million. The grounds of the site, which includes Roosevelt’s burial plot and a museum, will remain open. The National Park Service says about 154,000 visitors came to the Hyde Park site last year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTryon: The effort to preserve music legend Nina Simone’s childhood home now has the backing of a few of the biggest names in entertainment. This month, the National Trust for Historic Preservation kicked off a crowdfunding campaign it hopes will support the rehabilitation of the nearly 90-year-old house where Simone, then known as Eunice Waymon, grew up in Tryon. Members of the public can donate to the campaign in addition to buying new Simone-inspired merchandise designed by artist Dare Coulter and other merchandise donated for the cause by singer John Legend, rapper Talib Kweli and comedian Issa Rae. Funds raised are expected to be integral to restoring the exterior of the home where the “Mississippi Goddam” singer learned to play piano. Others involved in the fundraising effort include singer Yusef/Cat Stevens and Academy Award-winning actor Mahershala Ali.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group that pushed to legalize marijuana in the state last year is back for another try. Legalize ND expects to submit a new proposed initiative to the secretary of state’s office soon. The group’s leader, David Owen, said the new measure will be far more specific than the one that voters soundly defeated in November. The group’s proposal would limit possession to 2 ounces and wouldn’t allow home growing. It also calls for child-resistant packaging and no marketing to children. Owen said it also would prohibit smoking in public or in vehicles. The group needs about 13,450 signatures for the initiative to be approved for next year’s ballot. Owen said he expects signature-gathering to begin in August, several months earlier than last time around.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Researchers say toxin-producing algae have formed in Sandusky Bay and are migrating into Lake Erie near Cedar Point, a signal the lake’s western basin could see massive blooms this summer. The Blade reports an official from Bowling Green State University’s Great Lakes center says tests show toxin levels thus far are relatively low and don’t threaten water treatment systems in lakeside communities. Toxins from an algae bloom in 2014 caused massive problems for Toledo’s lake-fed system. Rick Stumpf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says heavy spring rains have helped push algae from the bay into the lake. Stumpf says that while spring rain has prevented farmers from planting and fertilizing, researchers can study the residual threat of “legacy” phosphorous runoff on the lake’s health.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A community council study reveals that 1 in 5 homeless people in Tulsa was employed last year, including almost 100 people who had no home despite having a full-time job. The Tulsa World reports that data from the Community Service Council study indicates more than 5,600 people were homeless in 2018. The survey found it took people 27 days on average to secure a home, and 65% were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers are partially based on an annual “point in time” census, in which officials counted every homeless person they could find at shelters, on the streets, in alleys and along underpasses. A homelessness coalition noted the number of homeless veterans in Tulsa fell by 16%, mirroring the success of programs that prioritize veterans.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state will pay for prepaid postage on mail-in ballots for next year’s general election in an attempt to boost turnout. The House voted 37-18 on Sunday to allocate nearly $1.7 million to pay postage costs. The program could cost the state more depending on how many voters send in ballots. Oregon switched to a vote-by-mail system in 2000. Gov. Kate Brown made prepaid postage a priority this year. She said low-income and younger residents don’t always have access to postage stamps. Opponents say that the move won’t noticeably increase voter turnout and that the money could be better used elsewhere. Washington state and California also cover postage costs for mail-in ballots.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Legislation to help agriculture in the state is going into effect, including measures to foster younger farmers, help clean water going into Chesapeake Bay and expand butchering services for small farmers. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed eight related farm bills in the Capitol on Monday, flanked by state presidents of the Future Farmers of America and the 4-H. The $23 million initiative includes funding for agricultural business development, marketing, educational programs and conservation practices. Money will also go to encourage specialty products such as hardwood, hemp and hops and to build agricultural infrastructure in urban areas. State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding calls it “the most comprehensive investment in agriculture in a generation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is planning a barbecue for veterans with the head of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The Rhode Island Democrat announced Thursday that he’s holding a community conversation and barbeque at the Slater Memorial Park pavilion in Pawtucket. House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, a California Democrat, plans to attend the July 14 event. It begins at noon. The committee has jurisdiction over legislation for veterans’ health care, benefits and other issues. The event is free and open to Rhode Island veterans and their families. Cicilline asks that attendees RSVP with his Pawtucket office. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Office of Veterans Affairs will be there to provide information about resources available to local veterans.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents will pay less to go to the state’s only public law school next year. The State newspaper of Columbia reports that in-state tuition will fall $5,100 next year at the University of South Carolina School of Law, thanks in part to an injection of new money by the General Assembly into public colleges and universities. Law School Dean Robert Wilcox says South Carolina has been losing students to out-of-state law schools because of cost. The full tuition price for law students last year was $29,608. Now it will be $24,508. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican, says lawmakers boosted spending at USC by $8 million this year, with the understanding that $1.9 million would specifically go to lower law school tuition.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has seen an uptick in sales tax revenue following a June 2018 Supreme Court decision that allows it to collect money from online retailers. A new law following that decision, which requires online businesses to pay sales taxes if they conduct at least $100,000 in gross sales in at least 200 transactions in the state, went into effect Nov. 1. Revenue Secretary Jim Terwilliger says business tax licenses issued to out-of-state and online retailers since then have helped South Dakota pocket $15.9 million in tax revenue. Terwilliger says the ruling was a “landmark decision” in tax administration. Thirty-one states have enacted legislation allowing them to collect sales taxes from online businesses.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As of Monday, drivers in the Volunteer State could face a fine up to $200 for using cellphones behind the wheel. All motorists will be prohibited from holding or physically supporting a phone while driving. Hands-free devices will be allowed, including “earpieces, headphone devices or a device worn on a wrist to conduct a voice-based communication,” the legislation says. Dashboard mounts will also be allowed. The state Senate approved the ban 23-7 in April. A driver’s first violation will result in a $50 fine. If the violation is the driver’s third offense or if it results in a wreck, the fine jumps to $100. If the violation occurs in a work zone when workers are present or in a school zone when warning flashers are on, the fine is $200. The bill excludes law enforcement, first responders, utility workers and others using a phone to make an emergency call.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The city is set to bring 10 rainbow crosswalks to a neighborhood known as the historic heart of the city’s LGBTQ scene. The Dallas Morning News reports the city council approved the crosswalk project in the Oak Lawn neighborhood last week as part of $1.4 million in street improvements. Former city council member Chris Luna, one of the city’s first openly gay officials, says the crosswalks will cost $128,000. Luna and the GLBT Chamber of Commerce Foundation raised $70,000 in six weeks for the crosswalk project. He’s also looking to raise another $30,000 for ongoing maintenance. He notes that construction is slated to begin in September and expected to finish by next March. Luna says he believes the project will mark the area as a safe space.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Serving a mission with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will soon be more expensive for many members of the faith. Church leadership sent a letter last week announcing that members will have to pay $500 a month starting in July 2020 for missions in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan. That is a 25% increase from the $400 a month that has been the rate since 2003. The Utah-based religion says the increase is needed because of rising costs of rent, food, utilities and transportation. The proselytizing missions are considered rites of passages for young members of the faith. Men serve two years, while women serve 18 months. There are currently about 67,500 missionaries around the world.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Future state troopers will be allowed to have arm tattoos, if they cover them up. In the past, applicants with tattoos that were visible when wearing short sleeves were not considered for employment. Under a policy update that starts Monday, such applicants would be welcomed but, if hired, would have to cover their arms with department-issued fabric sleeves. The policy continues to prohibit tattoos on the face, neck or hands, except for commitment band tattoos on ring fingers. Officials say that they recognize that tattoos have become more popular and that the new policy will allow the state to recruit a wider pool of applicants.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The National Rifle Association is holding a town hall meeting in the state about a month after the city experienced 2019’s deadliest mass shooting. The Virginian-Pilot reports one town hall was being held Monday, with another scheduled for Tuesday in Belle Haven on the state’s Eastern Shore. The lobbying arm of the NRA planned to focus on proposals that are likely to come up at the July 9 special legislative session that Gov. Ralph Northam convened in the tragedy’s wake. The Democrat said he wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider several gun control measures. Republicans have given little indication they plan to follow Northam’s agenda. Democrats quickly seized on the news of the NRA’s meetings, which some GOP lawmakers may attend.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: New gun regulations taking effect in the state include a ban on undetectable guns made using 3D printers. The Seattle Times reports that a law against so-called ghost guns took effect Monday, along with components of a previously instituted law raising the legal purchase age for some guns. A law passed in January raises the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles to 21. Additional clauses taking effect Monday include enhanced background checks for semi-automatic rifle buyers and a safe gun-storage provision. A gun owner could be charged with community endangerment if a firearm is accessed and used by someone who is not allowed to possess it, such as a child or a felon. Gun-rights advocates have filed a legal challenge against the initiative’s age restriction for semi-automatic rifles.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: NASA is holding a formal ceremony to rename a facility in the state after a mathematician whose calculations helped astronauts return to Earth. The ceremony is set for Tuesday in Fairmont for the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility. Congress passed a bill allowing the name change, and President Donald Trump signed it into law Dec. 11. Johnson, who is now 100, worked at NASA’s Langley Research Center as a human “computer.” She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in the film “Hidden Figures,” which documented the contributions of her and two other African American women while overcoming racism and sexism. Last year, Johnson was honored by alma mater West Virginia State University with a bronze statue and scholarship dedication.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that gives the state Department of Corrections another six months to close its troubled youth prison. Allegations of guard-on-prisoner abuse have plagued the facility near Irma for years. Legislators last year passed a law forcing the DOC to close the prison by Jan. 1, 2021, and create smaller facilities for juvenile offenders. Evers has said that timetable is too aggressive. He says replacement facilities won’t be ready by then. Republican Rep. Michael Schraa introduced a bill that keeps the prison open until July 1, 2021. The Assembly and Senate approved the bill in June. Evers announced Monday that he signed the bill Friday. He said in a news release that his top priority remains getting kids out of the youth prison.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The final deadline for competitors in a carbon-capture contest has been extended by four months. Carbon XPRIZE Executive Director Marcius Extavour says organizers want to make sure competitors have enough time to demonstrate their technologies. The extension means the final data submission for the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition is due June 30, 2020. Wyoming Public Radio reports XPRIZE will now announce the winner in September 2020, instead of the spring. The contest seeks to promote technology to put carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant to profitable use. The profits would offset the cost of keeping the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. Five teams will compete in the final round and get to test their ideas at a coal-fired power plant near Gillette.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/op-ed/philboas/2022/07/06/brittney-griner-friends-endanger-biden-russia-putin/7820359001/", "title": "Brittney Griner's friends may be putting her in greater peril", "text": "Brittney Griner is a hostage of the world’s worst tyrant. Vladimir Putin is a merciless destroyer of cities and people, and he no doubt sees Griner as nothing but a curio, a brass token he might one day trade or one day discard.\n\nHe’s busy waging war against the people of Ukraine and threatening all of Europe, so it’s doubtful he’s been thinking very hard about the Phoenix Mercury star or her field-goal percentage.\n\nFor her part, Griner seems to understand the stakes. In a letter to President Joe Biden on Monday, she wrote, “I’m terrified I might be here forever.”\n\nGriner is caught in a dangerous place. Not merely in a jail in authoritarian Russia, but amid the shifting plates of a changing world. Russia and China have become again expansionist powers and are shaking up the global order. Where this leads nobody knows.\n\nOft quoted today in western media is the Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci, who in a similar time said, “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”\n\nHe said that prior to WWII and foreshadowed Hitler and Stalin.\n\nPutin doesn't care about social justice\n\nThe first monster to emerge in today’s changing world is Putin. And as you read this, his soldiers are probably still executing civilians in the moonscapes that were once Ukrainian cities.\n\nIf you were given the chance to choose your bargaining partner, Putin might be the last person you’d choose. He cares little about human life or dignity.\n\nWith not much to work with, those closest to Griner are running the intersectional playbook.\n\nAnother view:Will Russians do the smart thing and free Griner?\n\nIntersectionality is a theory that, among other things, looks at groups of people as interlinking circles that form identities of oppression.\n\nSomeone who identifies as a woman, a gay person and an African American, as Griner does, is thrice marginalized, thrice oppressed in our society.\n\nIntersectionality is the brainchild of Kimberlé Crenshaw, UCLA and Columbia law professor who with Harvard’s Derrick Bell helped birth critical race theory.\n\nYet that's the case they're making for Brittney Griner\n\nThis week, the friends of Brittney Griner in the WNBA and among the modern civil rights movement used intersectionality – a social justice argument – to try to free her.\n\nAmong the first out of the gates was Griner’s head coach, Vanessa Nygaard. She told reporters: “If it was LeBron [James], he’d be home, right?”\n\nExpanding on that, Nygaard explained the continued imprisonment of Griner after several months is “a statement about the value of women. It’s a statement about the value of a Black person. It’s a statement about the value of a gay person. All of those things. We know it, and so that’s what hurts a little more.”\n\nThen came journalist Cari Champion in an interview with CNN: “It’s time we start saying the quiet part out loud.”\n\n“... She is Black. She is a woman. She is a lesbian. And do we care about her? It seems like we don’t.”\n\nSuch an argument resonates in a democratic society that still cares about the rights of the individual. It has zero influence on a thug like Vladimir Putin in a country like Russia, where government actively works to crush homosexuality and cares little for the rights of minorities.\n\nThe target audience isn't Putin. It's Biden\n\nBut this message wasn’t meant for Vladimir Putin. It was meant for Joe Biden, the president of the United States, elected in large part by a Southern bloc of African American voters. They delivered to him the Democratic Party nomination after he seemed all but defeated in his presidential primary.\n\nBiden, unlike Putin, is responsive to the concerns of American minorities. His vice president is an African American woman. He has appointed the first openly gay cabinet secretary, first female treasury secretary, first Black Pentagon chief and first Black woman U.S. Supreme Court justice. His spokesperson is the first Black person and first openly LGBTQ person to be White House press secretary.\n\nWhen friends of Brittney Griner argue the Biden White House is indifferent or even calloused to the humanity of a person who is Black, gay and a woman, it strains credulity.\n\nWhy that could hurt the Biden White House\n\nJoe Biden is leading the free world in supplying the Ukrainians with billions of dollars of funding and weaponry. He is leading the call for sanctions against Russian business and industry. He is a serious adversary and large thorn in the side of the Kremlin and its war machine.\n\nBy pressuring Joe Biden to swap a high-value Russian arms merchant and prisoner for Griner, the American social-justice left is becoming a large thorn in the side of Joe Biden.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Beltway newspaper The Hill noticed in a story headlined “Why Brittney Griner is a political problem for Biden.”\n\n“The public outcry around the plight of Brittney Griner is growing louder,” The Hill reported, “and that spells trouble for President Biden, who has been unable to free the basketball star from detention in Russia.”\n\n“... the continued failure of the Biden administration to obtain Griner’s release adds to the sense of powerless(ness) that has corroded the president’s standing on a number of other issues, from gas prices to inflation to the Supreme Court’s recent overturning of Roe v. Wade.”\n\nNo one can blame the friends of Brittney Griner for pulling out all the stops to try to win her release. They are desperate. They are well meaning.\n\nThe danger here is that their high-pressure campaign against Biden that underscores his powerlessness could become more valuable to Putin than any prisoner exchange.\n\nAnd that value will be lost the moment Griner is released from Russian captivity.\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist for The Arizona Republic.

There is a buzz about Baiz that can’t be faked, a feeling of community grounded in food, where Middle Eastern, Arabic and North African cultures come together. Al-Hana, the diminutive restaurant squeezed into a corner of Baiz, remains one of the city’s best spots to sample Arabic cuisine, a bustling place to catch a bite while taking a break from shopping for groceries. Breads are tender and steaming, topped with seasoned beef, spinach and cheese or a simple sprinkling of za’atar. Familiar mezze like baba ghannouj and hummus have an atypical richness (along with a proper helping of olive oil). Rotisserie-seared shawarma is juicy and gorgeously seasoned, piled atop rice or wrapped up with garlicky toum and pickled vegetables. Al-Hana might lack the polished efficiency of its contemporaries, but its pure flavor and energy cannot be denied.\n\nDetails: 523 N. 20th St., Phoenix.

If there’s one thing my readers seem to feel they lack, it’s meat-and-potatoes fare with a little Old-World charm. It’s here, but it can be a little hard to find, and All Pierogi kitchen is a standout. A no-frills Ukrainian mom-and-pop joint run by friendly folks, this is the go-to spot for pierogi, cabbage rolls and sausage. It’s distressing how many restaurants around town prepare this kind of food with the grace and dexterity of a drunken elephant, but that only makes it easier to appreciate a place that gets it right. Pierogi, whether boiled or pan-fried, are tender and flavorful; meat fillings have just the right texture and consistency; and sauces taste fresh and well-seasoned. Add a little soup, some vegetable salads, reasonable prices and you have some of the best Old-World cuisine in town.\n\nDetails: 1245 W. Baseline Road, Mesa.

Zhor Saad practically runs the restaurant by herself, which means dinner is outstanding, but it’s going to take a while. Unceremoniously tucked into a market and clothing store, Alzohour is a place where diners can drown in the sultry scent of Moroccan fare that’s equal parts bold and lusty. Arabic classics of variable quality round out the offerings, but the meat of the menu is in dishes like a silky, perfumed lamb tagine, meat dripping off the bone, heavy with saffron and spice. Couscous billows with steam, saturated with vegetables and topped with tender meats. Bastilla — a nutty ground chicken pie wrapped in crisp phyllo and dusted with cinnamon and sugar — is a mind-bending blend of savory and sweet. On the purely sweet end of the spectrum, Saad’s kunafeh is next level, almost custardy with a deep golden, crisp crust and a heavy dose of pistachio. Not all will appreciate the market-chic environment, but none of that matters when your host prepares everything with a warm heart and you’re lost in a saffron-scented cloud.\n\nDetails: 7814 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

When the Calabrian native tired of trying to please the white tablecloth crowd, he opened Andreoli, a casual neighborhood grocery with a few tables that serves some of the best traditional Italian fare in town. This culinary curmudgeon with an uncompromising vision is as likely to be in the front of house sipping espresso and watching soccer as he is to be in the back of house running the kitchen. His work is a devastating combination of simplicity, technique and killer ingredients that exposes the purveyors of oafish red sauce concoctions and pretentious, overworked modern Italian for the charlatans they are. Grab a loaf of craggy bread, order a perfect pasta or grilled seafood from the white board, snag some sticky cornetti marmelatta or crisp, layered sfogliatelle from the pastry case and consider yourself lucky that such a skilled Italian traditionalist calls Scottsdale home.\n\nDetails: 8880 E.

Sparingly decorated and showing its age, this strip-mall stalwart makes its impact on the plate; and a dual-menu system makes it the ideal place to ease neophytes into more traditional fare. The black-rimmed American menu features juicy pot stickers, crisp orange beef and sizzling pepper beef. But drift over to the red-rimmed traditional menu and the skies open. Meltaway duck is wrapped in a crisp taro crust; West Lake soup suspends gossamer threads of egg in a silky broth; braised tofu bubbles in a clay pot with sweet shrimp. And whole fish pulled live from the tank is buried in scallions and ginger and splashed with a bit of soy and shaoxing. Keep exploring, and when you’re ready for the stuffed duck feet, they’ll be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 9880 S. Rural Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-705-7486.

Quiet and unassuming, hidden in a strip mall on the fringes of the Old Town spotlight, it changes its colors through the years as chefs come and go. It’s also one of the most reliably excellent restaurants in the Valley — a BYOB, to boot — that has never been better than it is under the auspices of chef Cory Oppold. The stark antithesis of flashy downtown Scottsdale just a few blocks to the north, Atlas Bistro piggybacks on AZ Wine Company, an intimate room with minimal decor and sound-deadening walls. While the setting is modest, the plates are filled with pyrotechnics, showy but thoughtful multi-component affairs that nimbly merge disparate flavors and techniques to compelling effect. Think slivers of tender beef tongue pastrami with a honey mustard emulsion; kombu-marinated black cod with yerba mate béarnaise; or a goat cheese mousse spiked with Jidori chicken skin crisps and poached cranberries. Wine geeks love the capable bottle service and, as a bonus, Oppold’s vegetarian creations are some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 2515 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

The Osmic family first opened Balkan Bakery a decade ago, and while a short list of common baked goods and sweets are solid offerings, it’s the Bosnian specialties that make Balkan Bakery a destination. Aldijana prepares the cevapi, seasoning and stuffing the little sausages in preparation for the grill, where they take on a crisp char. Her brother, Jasenko, handles the stuffed breads, stretching a thin layer of dough over the prep table, stuffing and rolling it into a tube and, with a quick flick of his wrist, curling it into a tight swirl the size of a lunch plate. Stuffed with meat (burek), cheese (sirnica) or spinach (zeljanica), it’s divine, contrasting a light, crisp shell with a steaming, tender, layered interior.\n\nDetails: 1107 E. Bell Road, Phoenix.

At Bar Pesce — the recently refreshed moniker for what used to be Crudo — Italy may be the inspiration, but this born-and-bred Southerner is after something a little more lusty, weaving crudi, composed cheese plates and succulent meats from smoke and olive oil and acid. Uni is dressed with shaved shallot and avocado, while bottarga and i’itoi onions give sweet raw yellowtail a salty, spicy sting. Burrata is amped up with an unctuous pancetta vinaigrette; and ricotta is simply paired with walnuts and desert honey. Meltaway semolina gnocchi drown in a succulent lamb neck sugo, while lamb belly gently braises in milk and mirepoix. Even when Campbell’s flavors are light, they’re distilled down to a knee-buckling, vivid intensity. And the modest prices on the prix fixe aren’t a mistake — not only is this one of the best restaurants in town, it’s also one of the best bargains.\n\nDetails: 3603 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

Not to knock Sonora, but Mexico is a big country and most of its cuisine is still brutally underrepresented in Phoenix. Barrio Café gives the central and southern Mexican states a local voice. Cochinita pibil — pork steamed in achiote and sour orange — sneaks up from Yucatan. Puebla’s symbol of national pride, chiles en nogada, are stuffed with a chunky, fruit-laced picadillo and drenched in almond cream. The moles of Oaxaca — from a dark and smoky mole negro to the herbal, pungent pipian verde — are gorgeously complex. The kitchen throws caution to the wind, more concerned with dropping flavor bomb after flavor bomb than dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s. Fun-loving, sometimes irreverent servers are the antithesis of the standard-issue scripted corporate dullards.\n\nDetails: 2814 N. 16th St., Phoenix.

Tucked into a tiny wedge of a dining room with a wraparound view of Grand Avenue, Gran Reserva is Barrio Café’s elegant cousin, draped in white tablecloths and colorful trompe l’oeil. An a la carte menu rehashes many of Barrio Café’s greatest hits, but Gran Reserva’s mission is revealed in the menu de degustación, where Mexican fare reaches levels of refinement not seen elsewhere in the Valley. Sous vide duck meets sultry cranberry mole; suckling pig confit is treated with chile de arbol demiglace; and a cap of lime foam and queso Oaxaqueño sits half melted, wrapped in fragrant hoja santa with a touch of chile and peanut oil. The best part? At less than $50, the degustación menu is priced for the people, and a bevy of vegan dishes make Gran Reserva a viable option for anyone.\n\nDetails: 1301 W. Grand Ave., Phoenix.

He achieved the dream of a local restaurant group with enough concepts to make some coin but not so many that he had to sacrifice his integrity. But Binkley shut it all down for one reason: He isn’t a restaurateur and he desperately missed the kitchen. Now, the celebrated chef with obsessive focus and puckish tendencies has turned a Phoenix bungalow into his personal culinary playground — and everyone is invited. Fine dining has never been so welcoming, like a private dinner party that starts with a series of modernist amuses on the veranda; moves into the bar for snacks like grilled soppressata chips and confit duck wings; and ends in the dining room with coddled goose eggs, sweet pea agnolotti and whole roasted lamb. There is no fourth wall here (literally). Roll up your sleeves, step into the open kitchen and lend a hand. There’s plenty of joy to go around.\n\nDetails: 2320 E. Osborn Road, Phoenix.

But its sneaky, under the radar bar bites deserve their fair share of attention, too. Bob Tam’s menu — an irreverent foil for Ross Simon’s encyclopedic cocktail list — isn’t meant to be taken too seriously, but Tam’s puckish Asian fusion creations reveal his deep understanding of the underlying cuisines. The Angry Panda wraps crisp peanuts, chiles and dried anchovies in cool lettuce leaves with fresh herbs. Seoul fried chicken gets a sweet and spicy lift from watermelon kimchi with a dab of sesame ranch. Chinese buns are filled with deeply caramelized chunks of pork belly, a throwback to Tam’s days at San Francisco’s Betelnut. The Dragon Dumpling Burger is a juicy beef and pork concoction that channels the spirit of xiaolongbao into a burger slathered with mayo and Sichuan pickles, complete with dipping sauce. Best part? It all goes well with booze.\n\nDetails: Luhrs Building, 1 W. Jefferson St., Phoenix.

Under the auspices of celebrity chef Michael Mina and executive chef Sara Garrant, the flagship restaurant at Fairmont Scottsdale Princess sports a contemporary elegance and refinement. If you’re looking for a dry-aged tomahawk rib eye, they’ve got you covered. But the offerings also drift into esoterica, such as a butter-poached Snake River Farms rib eye cap that’s so tender and sweet it’s almost like a different animal altogether. If you really want to go big, the roster is deep with domestic and imported premium beef that runs up to $45 per ounce. Excellent sauces abound and sides show a penchant for Asian flavors, like mushrooms plied with white soy and mirin; or a dynamite short rib fried rice with kimchi and chunks of sweet Chinese sausage. It has the luxury prices to match, but, put simply, Bourbon Steak is operating at a higher plane than the rest of the pack.\n\nDetails: Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 E. Princess Drive.

But the Pua family came to the rescue in 2015 and still stands tall as the lone ambassador for Malaysian cuisine. Thankfully, it’s a charming, casual little spot with an extensive menu filled with dishes unobtainable anywhere else in town. Batter-dipped chicken wings are fried to a shattering crisp and served with two spicy-sweet sambals — the “mama” and the “papa.” Roti canai pairs thick, oily flatbread with a rich coconut-based curry sauce for dipping and slurping. Laksa — the iconic Malaysian soup that takes many forms — is done here as a rich and fragrant coconut and lemongrass broth with noodles, seafood and bean sprouts. Sweet, steamed Hainan chicken is paired with rich, oil-splashed rice. And char kway teow — a universal crowd-pleaser — is a warm and steaming stir-fry of thick rice noodles in a sweet and comforting soy-based sauce.\n\nDetails: 1845 E. Broadway Road, Tempe.

Jamaican food is hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop fare, a quarter of fiery jerk chicken or slippery stewed oxtails ladled into a to-go container with rice, beans and plantains, right? But island cuisine can bring an air of refinement just like any other, and here’s the proof. Jamaican-born rum savant Dwayne Allen takes a deep dive into his spirit of choice, slinging educational flights and stellar cocktails in the dark and cozy Rum Bar. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Danielle Leoni has adopted the flavor and fire of her husband’s homeland, leading a kitchen that puts Jamaican fare in a context rarely seen in the States. Scallops seared in cast iron get a splash of Appleton rum for a sweet, rich glaze, while vinegary sauteed shrimp explode with cayenne and habanero. Pan-fried escovitch fish is buried under a pile of sultry vegetables. And Leoni’s house jerk — whatever it seasons — pulls no punches, an uncompromising blend of vinegar, spices, chiles and herbs that is as flavorful as it is incendiary.\n\nDetails: 108 E.

Vince Mellody is playing that part at one of the Valley’s more quirky and delicious recent openings. Housed in a decidedly chill Coronado bungalow without a hint of pretention or ego, Bri (rhymes with pie) slings an ever-changing collection of small, creative plates, most of them forged in a South African-style grill over live coals. The room is comfortable and Mellody’s food is on point. But Bri’s greatest asset, perhaps, is a menu that’s almost pointedly out of lockstep with its contemporaries. Frico caldo, Italian pan-fried cheese and potato cakes, sport a gorgeous lacy crisp and a dollop of tomato relish. Tender, charred pork ribs are laced with fermented black beans and crisped shallots, while slow-roasted duck breast gets a topping of crisp chile sauce. A pureed Persian salad called bademjan employs eggplant to devastating effect, charred jet-black to lend a little bitterness and a ton of depth.\n\nDetails: 2221 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

Truth is, Buddyz makes a better deep dish than most of the joints back home, and I include the big, beloved goons like Lou Malnati’s, Giordano’s and Gino’s East. All of which is to say that somebody has to sing the praises of this place. A recent expansion effort has brought Buddyz out of the pastures of Queen Creek, which is a good thing; it was flying under the radar for too long and there’s nobody who doesn’t need this in their life. A thick, crunchy crust gets a none-too-subtle (but not overwhelming) puddle of melty cheese and a crown of bright, chunky tomato sauce, seasoned just so and spruced up with the requisite punch of dried herbs. Equal parts dinner and architecture, it’s a gooey, hedonistic mess. Deep dish isn’t pizza? It’s a casserole, you say? Call it whatever you want, tough guy. Now shut up, eat it and then tell me to my face that it didn’t taste good.\n\nDetails: 18423 E. San Tan Blvd., Queen Creek. MAP IT! 480-822-1225.

Sun Johnson, who was born and raised in Korea, teamed up with Nick Rocha to open a Korean restaurant that’s a rarity in the Valley. Why? It doesn’t act as though Korean cuisine is exclusively about grilled meat. Forget the tabletop grill. Ga Hyang doesn’t have them — it doesn’t need them. Start with duk boki, a mix of chewy rice cakes and tender fish cakes, swimming in a bath of pure onion and chile fire. Follow with haemul pajeon, a thick, crisp pancake stuffed with sweet scallions and seafood of all manner. When it’s a furnace outside, take refuge in mul naeng myun, slippery noodles with beef brisket and slivers of crisp, fresh fruit in a mustard-spiked beef broth that is literally iced over. Or warm yourself with a pure, milky sul long tang, slow-simmered from beef bones. The best thing here comes free of charge. Johnson’s banchan — the collection of pickled, marinated and fermented little dishes that accompany the meal — run circles around every other Korean restaurant in town. Nobody even comes close.\n\nDetails: 4362 W. Olive Ave., Glendale. MAP IT! 623-937-8550.

That’s no less true of the original Carolina’s near downtown Phoenix, where some dishes are better than others. But what Carolina’s does right is very, very right, and a diverse crowd that seems to represent the entire city comes down every day to take part in it. If we’re being honest, Carolina’s is a decrepit hole in the wall with little more than folding tables and chairs and a couple of soda machines. But what comes out of the kitchen is nothing less than the soul of Phoenix. Carolina’s was making giant flour tortillas decades before California decided it was cool, and they’re still some of the best — made to order and hot enough to burn your tongue. They make some fabulous, soupy burros, wrapped around stewed green or red chile, though the less iconic Oaxaca Special — with beans, cheese and chorizo — may be my favorite. Better yet, go ahead and get a machaca chimichanga. Here, it’s light and crisp, almost like pastry, and they might be the best argument for the form around.\n\nDetails: 1202 E. Mohave St., Phoenix.

Shouldn’t we have gotten over this by now? I say a lusty celebration of all things fragrant and funky is the cure, and Casa Filipina is where we’re going to throw the party. The poster child for laid-back international fare, Casa Filipina is a cozy mom-and-pop shop that joins a bakery and restaurant. The former fills multiple cases with wild and colorful sweets; the latter fills a menu with homestyle classics of Filipino cuisine. The uninitiated can ease into things with papery-crisp, cigar-shaped lumpia — Filipino spring rolls — or tortang talong, a gentle, comforting omelet stuffed with eggplant and pork. Speaking of pork, swineophiles will lose their minds over the crisp pata, a massive pork hock fried to a golden crisp; or the lechon kawali — chunks of crispy pork with a liver-enriched, sweet-and-sour sauce. When you’re ready, the funky, peanutty intensity of the kare kare or the dinuguan — a gorgeously thick, black vinegar and pork blood-enriched stew — will be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 3531 W.

Cantonese, Sichuan, Hunan, sure, but who had even heard of Dongbei, nestled up to Korea in the far northeast reaches of the country? For many, Sunny Zhao and Lulu Zhou’s dumpling-dispensing destination was the first glimpse into a world of Chinese cuisine that stretched far beyond Americanized versions of midcentury standbys. Out with the rice, in with the wheat, formed into nubby chilled noodles dressed with tingling oil, baked into bread stuffed with leeks and rolled into the wrappers for Chou’s signature beef pies. The size of a hamburger patty with the juice of a soup dumpling and a sizzling, crunchy crust, they’re not to be missed. The winter gets cold in northwestern China, and Chou’s packs the kind of hearty soups and stews meant to insulate you from the cold and generate some heat. Not that we need more heat in Phoenix, but it’s a fascinating subset of Chinese cuisine to explore.\n\nDetails: 910 N. Alma School Road, Chandler, 480-821-2888. MAP IT! Also, 1250 E.

Sure, this is casual fare served from behind a fish counter, but its diminutive footprint belies the oversize impact it’s having on the local scene. Jon Heflin and Hogan Jamison truck in stellar seafood from San Diego three times a week, and the few staples they can’t catch or trade themselves are flown in from excellent sources. What isn’t sold in the case or distributed to local restaurants goes to chef Juan Zamora, who has crafted a compact but robust list of bowls, salads and sandwiches with everyday character and a hint of refinement. Cool mounds of cubed fish are joined by shishito peppers, slivered watermelon radish or pickled beech mushrooms. A delicately composed tostada or bruschetta might light up the specials board. Wednesday’s green chile tuna melt with fresh confit tuna and kimchi chimichurri has developed a fan club. There’s a reason the line is out the door and you can’t swing a stick in the place without hitting at least three chefs who are grabbing lunch on the way to work.\n\nDetails: 8015 E.

Formerly the right-hand man of Binkley’s culinary operation, Gauthier recently took over Carefree’s Café Bink and converted it into Confluence, a new spot that has the Valley’s fine-dining geeks all atwitter. In appearance, this is still a casual restaurant, little changed from the Café Bink days. But while the plates show Binkley’s influence on Gauthier’s work, this wild, creative fare is worlds apart from the bistro classics that previously anchored the space. A roasted peach dusted with cocoa and drizzled with honey plays against a creamy, funky Epoisses cheese fondue. A gloriously salty pork broth with simmered cockscomb works its way into the fibers of a slab of smoked pork belly, lightened with shiso and edamame. Fish dishes are tight. Golden pan-seared red snapper contrasts earthy lentils with sweet grapes and a light broth set ablaze with Calabrian chile. Halibut sits in a lush corn crema with little nibbles of Spanish chorizo and crispy garlic chips. Just a few months old, Confluence is doing some seriously exciting things and may be the sleeper hit of 2018.\n\nDetails: 36889 N. Tom Darlington Drive, Carefree.

Having parted ways with Helio Basin Brewing Co., Stanger teamed up with Sean Traynor to open a neighborhood restaurant/watering hole in suddenly red-hot south Tempe. The joint is no-frills, casual and a little raucous with a young drinking crowd. Cocktails, appropriately light and summery in the early going, have made for a nifty collection of refreshing concoctions. Stanger’s food, meanwhile, already is equal parts sharp and fascinating. Corn dumplings that resemble hush puppies sit in a thin, onion-rich Parmesan cream that’s good enough to be served on its own as a chilled soup. Forget the veggie burgers — Stanger builds a “burger” from celeriac and roasted vegetables that’s more satisfying than most meat substitutes. Medallions of beef swim in a Cheddar-scented beef jus; and the Belgian hare, with root vegetable pipian and a bit of apricot, is dynamite. Whatever you do, don’t skip the pie.\n\nDetails: 1006 E. Warner Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-629-4270, cottonandcopperaz.com.\n\nCrepe Bar\n\nJeff Kraus is a madman in the best possible way. It took a bit of a culinary kook to open a restaurant based around creative crepes in south Tempe long before south Tempe suddenly became cool. And thank heavens Kraus has no fear, because six years later, Crepe Bar still thrives, its namesake serving as a foundation to pitch a technicolor panoply of Kraus’ wild concoctions. His crepes might sport pork belly in a sweet espresso-maple glaze, drizzled with chile aioli under a soft, runny egg. They might be rolled and crisped like dosa, to be shattered and dipped in hummus with crispy chickpeas. They could be turned into chips to make crepe chilaquiles or smothered with jerk sausage and Fontina. They could be plied with lemon curd and hibiscus jelly, maple butter with bruleed bananas and pecans; or formed from buckwheat with Sonoran honey. Not to knock tradition, but creations like these are an expression of pure culinary joy — the intersection of a wild imagination and obsessive attention to detail with the humble crepe as the hook.\n\nDetails: 7520 S. Rural Road, Tempe.

There is also the fact that Rich Hinojosa’s creations — whatever you wish to call them — are flat-out delicious. In Crujiente’s case, consider the taco a template, where tortillas serve as the flavorful foundation for meticulously crafted small plates that draw from Hinojosa’s heritage, his fine-dining pedigree and a wide palette of international flavors. A gorgeous slip of Texas wagyu is dressed with puckery pickled shimeji mushrooms, cilantro mojo and a dab of karashi mustard. A steaming wedge of crisp tempura-fried avocado pairs with black beans and pickled onions and chiles. Fish, tender and juicy or deftly fried, is perfectly seasoned and dressed. And the tacos Crujientes, piled into a craggy, crisp shell, exemplify the Mexican-American crossover dishes of Hinojosa’s San Antonio upbringing.\n\nDetails: 3961 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

What can I say? David Najor serves a flipping-good dog at the Tempe original (the downtown Phoenix location is independently owned). This is a decadent coney we’re talking about: A gently spiced, natural-casing dog with a killer snap — made for Najor by a Michigan sausage maker — drowning in meaty sauce, onions and a squirt of yellow mustard. Fries are spot-on, too, freshly cut and fried with a little crisp and a steaming, tender core. The burgers are just as good. Tiny golf-ball-size wads of meat are smashed on the griddle and cooked to a juicy, sizzling crisp, then layered with cheese and stacked tall. They’ll happily make them larger or smaller, but three to five of these skinny patties is the sweet spot, in my book. Grab a Faygo and a bag of chips and you’re good to go. Sure, it’s just burgers and dogs. But burgers and dogs are rarely so correct.\n\nDetails: 930 W. Broadway Road, Tempe.

A boutique hotel is in the works for the corner where Don & Charlie’s now stands, and pending city approval, Don Carson stands poised to enjoy a well-deserved retirement. But at the very least, this Chicago-style tavern with enough sports memorabilia to fill a museum will have one final sendoff during spring training. This is the kind of fare that appeals to the baseball crowd: chopped liver with crunchy bagel chips; scampi “Chicago style” (that’s shrimp DeJonghe for those in the know); baby back ribs sauced and charred to a smoky crisp; and a meat locker full of steaks, including a killer prime rib eye with a deep, blackened crust. This is well-prepared, easy-to-enjoy food served in a comfy old Barcalounger of a restaurant, and she’ll be dearly missed.\n\nDetails: 7501 E. Camelback Road, Scottsdale.

Justin Park’s food is meant to be consumed with alcohol, plain and simple, and it’s riotously fun. Tteok kochi — chewy little rice cake nubbins basted with gochujang, broiled to a sticky crisp and dusted with crushed peanuts — is the ultimate bar snack, as far as I’m concerned. The fire chicken is a rare spicy dish that lives up to its name, swimming in a screaming hot chile gravy beneath a blanket of melted mozzarella. Crispy chunks of fried chicken abound, whether doused in a sweet and spicy Korean red sauce, served with slivered onions and a creamy dressing or offered as padak — topped with a mountain of shredded scallions and a sweet soy-mustard dip. And the seafood pancake is an unusual take thereon, loose and eggy on the top with a delicately crisped bottom. Come for the food, stay for the booze and karaoke, then order a second round of snacks.\n\nDetails: 1954 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

On recent visits to the Phoenix icon’s namesake steakhouse, I’ve had immolated chops, sauteed spinach that’s mostly unseasoned cream and salads composed of limp, wilting spring mix. And yet I find myself unable to leave Durant’s off my list. Not because I’m afraid to slay a sacred cow — there are enough popular omissions here to jam my inbox with angry reader emails for months — but because goldarnit, I just can’t help but love the place. Durant’s is as much a museum as it is a restaurant, a rare relic of a bygone era filled with red leather banquettes, patterned velvet walls and worn wooden bars. Meanwhile, servers are there when you need them, gone when you don’t, and they hit that perfect note of graceful deference with just a faint, sardonic wink. Restaurants like Durant’s simply don’t exist anymore, except when they do, apparently. I can’t look past what a rare and special place it is, no matter how badly the kitchen overcooks my steak. No, the food isn’t especially good. But I’ll be there, if they’ll still have me, sitting at the bar with a shrimp cocktail and a very large martini.\n\nDetails: 2611 N. Central Ave., Phoenix.

Sonoran hot dogs abound, particularly late at night, when the air starts to cool and the temporary street stands set up shop. One crucial quality separates good from the great: toasting. The worst Sonoran dog with a freshly griddled bun will be better than most of those with a steamed bun, but El Caprichoso doesn’t force us to choose. This is the quintessential Arizona street dog — a cheap, low-quality sausage wrapped in crisp bacon with a grocery list of Mexican toppings and a sweet bun griddled to a deep, gorgeous gold. A folding table, a pop-up tent, some fluorescent light and 100-degree temps at 2 a.m. and you have an Arizona rite of passage.\n\nDetails: 2826 N. 35th Ave., Phoenix.

Serving breakfast and lunch to a pickup-truck crowd, Rosa Avitia’s Mexican diner is a casual charmer. There’s something unassuming and honest in her minimal chilaquiles, stale tortillas toasted in oil, doused with fresh salsa and topped with melted mozzarella cheese and a dusting of cotija. A dead-simple birria pairs tender goat with thick corn tortillas, a basic broth that only comes alive when doctored to your taste. But the killer app, so to speak, is the machaca. At so many restaurants, it’s rehydrated sludge with the flavor of acrid pot roast. Here, it’s simple dried beef, pounded and cooked with just a splash of liquid, still dense and chewy — almost jerky-like — and perfect with eggs. The cebada, an horchata-like drink made with barley, is still too sweet, but it’s more flavorful and less overly sweet than most. Served in a giant red plastic cup, it somehow makes the whole meal feel correct.\n\nDetails: 2140 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix.

It’s been more than a year since Eugenia Theodosopoulos closed the Tempe location of Essence Bakery Café, and if fans of the original are still a little raw, it isn’t hard to see why. She is an enormously skilled baker who brought her French training to the desert and — this is no easy task — learned to adapt her techniques to our environment. Her delicate macarons are what set the Pinterest crowd on fire. But there are stellar baked goods aplenty, like perfect croissants, crisp baguettes, fruit Danish and seasonal specials like buche de noel. More substantial fare is also a delight. Theodosopoulos makes an excellent turnover studded with crumbled sausage and Gruyere and — to nobody’s surprise — a killer quiche. Come lunchtime, a béchamel-drenched croque monsieur with a bit of jalapeño buzz or a silky chicken pot pie are both winners. And she sneaks in a little bit of her heritage in the form of a gloriously light spanakopita.\n\nDetails: 3830 W. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

This is the kind of place that restaurateurs will tell you isn’t supposed to succeed on the left half of the map. And yet there it is: A tiny independent serving straight-up traditional Italian classics, made with exceptional care and steadfastly refusing to drift into red sauce territory to please the masses. Fabio Ceschetti’s decision to abandon Scottsdale in favor of Peoria has paid him in spades, and it wasn’t a complex equation. This is the soul of casual Italian dining, serving wood-fired pizza and paste fatte in casa, such as lasagna plied with meaty ragu and smooth besciamella or airy gnocchi simply dressed in a silky, Gorgonzola-laced cream. Pizzas are spot-on, a gentle balance of chew and crisp and deeply developed flavor, topped with just a few perfect ingredients. Small, family-run spots that do so little but do it so well are the backbone of Italy’s restaurant culture, and the perfect antidote to a barrage of chains that overpromise and underdeliver.\n\nDetails: 8275 W.

There are endless reasons to love FnB, a quirky, cozy space that embodies its proprietors’ penchant for marching to their own beat. There’s Charleen Badman’s preternatural ability to coax vegetables into revealing their truest nature; her talent for sizzling premium proteins on the grill; and Pavle Milic’s zeal for Arizona wines and spirits. But perhaps more than all of that, their work has put a bold stamp on the Valley’s emergence as a maturing, sophisticated culinary scene that can run with the big boys without feeling the need to mimic them. Potted smoked trout rillettes join rustic bread and a rainbow of pickled vegetables. Creamy Peruvian aji amarilllo is wrapped in a crisp spring roll shell. And the Gilfeather rutabaga is a witty play on a classic baked potato, plied with ginger creme fraiche and chives. The way Badman ropes in diverse international influences while expressing Arizona’s underappreciated agricultural bounty is unparalleled. If one restaurant best exemplifies the blossoming of our cuisine over the past decade, it’s FnB.\n\nDetails: 7125 E. Fifth Ave., Scottsdale.

He followed his daughter to New York, and it seemed that his charming destination for classic Italian fare might be lost forever. But in 2012, he returned to Old Town and opened up a time portal on Scottsdale Road, leading straight into a bygone era of white tablecloths, soft music, servers who know when not to talk and Italian fare that sports a little class while satisfying on a deep, visceral level. Photos of Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren line the walls; a pungent swipe of fresh garlic lines the bruschetta; and a crisp, perfectly seasoned crust lines the exterior of the orecchie elefante, Fazzuoli’s take on a juicy, thick-cut veal chop Milanese. Franco’s gently tiptoes the line between Italian and American, embracing some of the New World’s meatier, saucier habits without drifting into full-blown red sauce territory. This is classic cuisine done right, a bit of old-school elegance and a nod to the days when we used the word “continental” without some of the era’s clunky heft. And if anything starts to feel a touch too rich, a taste of Fazzuoli’s sweet, airy merenghata will take care of that... subito.\n\nDetails: 4327 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

It’s even more unfortunate the one dish that has achieved widespread attention — fry bread— isn’t rooted in indigenous people’s centuries of history and culture. Rather, fry bread was a food of necessity prepared with government rations during a time when that same government was evicting them from the land that had sustained their culture. Still, here’s a dish that has become an emblem — both good and bad. The Fry Bread House, recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of America’s Classics, makes by far the most delicious version I’ve tried in Phoenix. The first taste of Fry Bread House’s steaming, resilient bread with a gorgeous golden crisp is an “Aha!” moment, whether it’s piled with beans and meaty chile or dusted with cinnamon or powdered sugar and drizzled with honey.\n\nDetails: 4545 N.

When Gallo Blanco left the Clarendon Hotel, chef Doug Robson promised the white rooster would rise again. It took a few years, but the new Gallo Blanco is worth the wait. Robson’s casual, stylish spot in the Garfield district is leading a new wave of contemporary Arizona Mexican fare that’s smartly conceived, crisply executed, made with top-notch ingredients and a bargain for the price. Thick tortillas cradle taco fillings that get a quick sizzle in a wok. Salads composed with pristine produce boast a textural pop that gives them uncommon appeal. Quick-cured fish dishes like coctel de mariscos and ceviche de pescado are light and vibrant. And drippy, hedonistic affairs like the egg-soaked naco torta or the envuelto — pork al pastor suspended in gooey, griddled cheese — are completely irresistible. Toss in JT Taber’s breezy cocktails and it’s hard to want for more in a casual Mexican restaurant. If this is the wave of the future, we’re in for a good ride.\n\nDetails: 928 E. Pierce St., Phoenix.

Just as Asian fusion was newly reborn as a subtler, more sophisticated version of its schlocky ‘90s self, Chamberlin and his chefs, Rene Andrade and Roberto Centeno, are doing the same with the Southwest fare of yore, making it lighter, fresher and more thoughtful. A couple of months into its run, Ghost Ranch is making a mark. A stylish New Mexico-inspired room designed by Gennaro Garcia proves an airy and colorful home to dishes that reference the history of Southwest cuisine while bucking its more dated conventions. Pumpkin soup is smooth and lush, its richness derived from caramelization rather than abundance of cream. Enchiladas are fried to a crisp and lightly dressed rather than smothered in an earthy, smoky sauce made with Chimayo chiles. The chile relleno is roasted rather than fried, stuffed with intense mushroom duxelles and topped with a nest of crispy leeks. And in a true nod to the times, one of the strongest dishes on the menu is the plato vegano, a gorgeous and hearty collection of roasted vegetables with a splash of coconut milk and a chipotle cashew cream.\n\nDetails: 1006 E.

But the soft-spoken Kantak is so much more than a salad slinger. The Gladly, his sophomore effort, is on point, a casual and stylish American restaurant that isn’t afraid to have fun. Sassy, hearty and just a little wonky enough with the fundamentals to satisfy, The Gladly slings a mean chicken liver pate with pistachio and sage mustard. Plus, a gorgeous duck meatloaf enriched with foie gets a smoked cherry demi-glace. Larded scallops are plied with a cola gastrique; and coffee-rubbed short ribs are eye-opening in more than one sense of the term. What’s more, Donald Hawk’s raw bar — offering straight-up chilled seafood alongside creations like his signature ahi crudo with brown-butter vinaigrette and raising relish — is the icing on an already formidable cake.\n\nDetails: 2201 E.

Glai Baan is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Cat Bunnag’s achingly charming little bungalow took a while to find its footing (though accurate at the time, I wish I could have that review back). But in 2018, it’s consistently spitting fire. With the ease of a seaside beach house and the warmth of a neighborhood bar, Glai Baan is a time-slowing destination that combines a mellow room with explosive dishes. That doesn’t always mean chile heat (nor should it). Coconut-marinated pork skewers are tender and sweet; deep-fried son-in-law eggs are dressed with a tart, punchy sauce; and mackerel fried rice is a steamy, comforting affair with a distinctive fermented richness. But when the fire arrives, it’s on. Funky salted crab papaya salad is dense with bird chiles. Kapro gai kai dao perks up minced chicken and a lacy egg with basil and no shortage of chiles. And a complex panang curry has some heat, but not at the expense of layer after fragrant layer of fresh, intense flavor. We were long overdue for a place like this.\n\nDetails: 2333 E.

Right up until that part of me was stuffed in a sack and tossed in a river by the part of me that can’t recall having more juicy, succulent, perfectly grilled meats anywhere else in town. I surrender. Yes, Green Corner looks like an antiseptic neighborhood counter-service joint, but just try to keep me away from the kifta kabob, scented with sumac and cinnamon, tender and meaty and dripping with sizzling lamb fat. You’ve seen this menu a hundred times before, and standards like baba ghannoug, hummus and kibbeh are all solid, if less than stellar. But anything off the phalanx of rotisseries or the kitchen’s grill is something to target, whether it be charred shawarma, plump chicken thighs or lamb chops seared on the grill. The truth is, most of the Valley’s widely revered Middle Eastern restaurants don’t season and cook their meats nearly as well as Green Corner.\n\nDetails: 1038 W. Southern Ave., Mesa, 480-835-2313.

Here, you’ll find a mix of classic maki and nigiri built on a solid foundation of excellent seafood and rice alongside Hashimoto’s more brash, contemporary creations. Among them: the Hana Egg, a soft-boiled, tempura-fried egg paired with a zippy mentaiko sauce; and grilled lamb marinated with miso and pomegranate juice. This is a family that can bring the wow factor if you want it. But the unsung heroes of the menu are Hana’s classic Japanese comfort dishes, whose charms are rooted in culinary tradition. Chicken karaage is perfectly seasoned, crisp and juicy. Bento boxes feature popular items like teriyaki and tonkatsu, but they’re anchored with simple simmered vegetables. Chilled soba noodles come with ethereal tempura and an icy, crystal-clear tsuyu dip; and ramen is firm to the tooth and bathed in lush, flavorful broths. The gleaming raw fish and colorful oyster shooters may win Instagram, but while plenty of neighborhood sushi joints can feed your eyes, few can feed your soul like Hana.\n\nDetails: 5524 N.

The new, contemporary resort is less the swingin’ hot spot of its ‘60s heyday and more a luxe oasis that’s built as a picture frame for nearby Camelback Mountain. At Hearth ’61, chefs Charles Wylie, Richard Garcia and Alfred Muro walk the tightrope of producing inventive cuisine while adhering to the constraints of being the resort’s primary restaurant, and the restaurant is finding its stride. A swanky and lively room complete with a water feature is the proper home for a spicy, rough-hewn ahi tartare dressed with crisp, fresh vegetables or roasted prawns with andouille-flecked polenta. Soups like a squash puree or a lobster bisque have a silky feel and bold intensity; and a side of ancient grain risotto is a nutty delight. Hefty short rib agnolotti splashed with horseradish cream are like an Italian-Polish crossover dish; and simple roasted meats are beautifully prepared. But I’m still stuck on the swordfish steak, a juicy specimen set ablaze by an herbal, green harissa.\n\nDetails: Mountain Shadows Resort, 5445 E. Lincoln Drive, Paradise Valley.

The cure for this epidemic of meaty myopia rests in places like Hodori. An ancient stalwart of the Valley’s Korean restaurant scene, Hodori continues to stand tall as one of its best and most welcoming. Kimchi jun with a gentle sourness and prominent burn sizzles; and bosam — steamed pork with spicy fermented accompaniments and cabbage to wrap — is a decadent platter that could feed a few dozen. Soups and stews are the thing, whether they include delicate tofu swimming in a sea of soondubu fire or milky dogani tang, an ox knee and brisket elixir with a gentle, restorative countenance. And don’t worry. If you insist on meatifying, the kitchen does a very respectable job with standards like juicy chok kalbi and daeji bulgogi in a fire-laced marinade.\n\nDetails: 1116 S.

A Western-trained chef who spent a year working in Japan, Hebert has developed a very personal style of ramen that might get under the skin of the tonkotsu fanboys, but it’s hard to see that as a bad thing. It isn’t that he hasn’t done his homework. He’s a student of the cuisine who made his name blending French and Japanese flavors and techniques in upscale environs. But like so many shops in Japan that are playing with convention, Hebert’s humble ramen bar uses the framework as a means of self-expression. What he’s expressing is one of the best bowls of noodles in town. The goma is the signature item, a sesame-spiked pork broth with a nutty countenance. But the gently smoky shoyu and the chile-spiked seafood ramen are also personal favorites. Spiked with some unconventional ingredients and possessed of non-traditional tweaks, they’re solidly grounded in careful technique.\n\nDetails: 15689 N. Hayden Road, Scottsdale.

Some do it better than others and a few are quite good, but the rote collection of pho, bun and broken rice dishes has achieved the formulaic predictability of a fast-food chain. At Mekong Plaza, the sit-down restaurants in the front may be more popular, but the food court in the back is where you’ll find the action. Hue Gourmet features the flavors of central Vietnam, and if your experience with Vietnamese food is limited to your neighborhood pho joint, this will be a game-changer. Chewy, thick tapioca noodles and chunks of crab comprise the viscous, briny banh canh cua. Mi quang marries turmeric-spiced noodles with shrimp, pork, vegetables and crisp sesame crackers. Banh beo, glutinous rice coins, are dotted with dried shrimp and served with a lip-puckering sauce. The bun bo hue is the genuine article — a fiery, funky lemongrass soup thick with beef and pork, rather than the doctored pho you’ll find elsewhere in town. And speaking of pho, don’t bother: They don’t make it, and you won’t miss it.\n\nDetails: Mekong Plaza, 66 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

Yeah, Chelsea’s Kitchen makes the Arcadia moms swoon; Buck & Rider’s parking lot is jam-packed at all hours with silver and black SUVs; and La Grande Orange has practically achieved historical landmark status at this point. But I love Ingo’s sun-dappled patio and circular dining bar. I love those tart, mustardy deviled eggs and shattered potato chips with yogurt and searing hot sauce. I love the crispy fried sandwiches, both chicken and fish. I love the barbecue and bacon-laden Paris Texas burger. I love the Farmer’s Daughter burger, with tart sauerkraut and funky fol epi. And I love that I can eat one of those burgers and not feel like I just consumed half a cow. The thing is, Lynn is a student of careful design and he runs a tight ship. When you’re talking about a neighborhood burger stand, that makes it just a little special.\n\nDetails: 4502 N. 40th St., Phoenix.

Though I’m a hopeless fanboy, by all public accounts, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has barely set foot in Arizona since J&G opened. But to overlook it on that basis would be a grand disservice to Jacques Qualin, who has taken the international super chef’s vision and made J&G Steakhouse his own. Yes, the steaks are excellent, and if you’re the saucy type, they’re accompanied by the best in town. But to my mind, that’s the least interesting part of the menu. I geek out on piping-hot Dungeness crab fritters with cool Asian pear and a sweet sauce laden with black pepper. I swoon over chilled crab and avocado with a smooth and creamy cocktail sauce tarted up with brandy. I marvel at ruby-red, sweet-and-sour beet risotto with a puckery lemon foam. I salivate over seared beef cheeks with a buttery habanero hot sauce. And I chill with baked Alaska, like a creamy bruleed hedgehog, cool pineapple sorbet waiting within. I have a Vongerichten trading card pinned up in my cubicle. But to me, this is Qualin’s restaurant.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

That’s the kind of stridently unpretentious hole-in-the-wall barbecue dive that fulfills all our romantic storybook notions of what American smoked meat should be. James Lewis didn’t even have a restaurant to call home until 2017, before which he sold barbecue from a guerilla street operation parked under a bridge. But now with a south Phoenix storefront of his own, it’s far easier to sample his ruby ribs with tender chew, juicy and succulent smoked chicken and a barky, chaotic tangle of pulled pork that’s the best I’ve tried in the Valley. His understated, Zen-like sauce is a supplement, not a distraction, and a killer cup of peppery stewed greens headlines unusually good sides. The secret? The ebullient Lewis will insist it’s what the “JL” in JL Smokehouse stands for: “Just Love.”\n\nDetails: 1712 E. Broadway Road, Phoenix.

The atmosphere is essentially nonexistent and the line can be long and slow. But none of that matters when you’re presented with a smooth, elastic round of yam fufu, bathed in a spiced tomato soup brimming with goat meat. This is west African cuisine — hewing closest to Ghanaian — built on seasoned starches, meats and thick, sultry stews. The chicken stew is deep and ruddy with the rich sweetness of reduced tomatoes, while the bean stew is round and robust with beans that have perfect bite. Jollof rice arrives with tender chicken and slippery sweet plantains. Waakye — Ghana’s take on rice and beans — goes equally well with stewed goat or a mound of seasoned spinach. And the peanut soup defies the sweet conventions to which Americans are accustomed, striking a deliciously deep, earthy note.\n\nDetails: 325 W. Elliot Road, Tempe.

Under the direction of chef Ryan Swanson, Kai is as good as ever, and maybe better. From the room to the service to the plates, here’s a rare restaurant that exudes refinement at every turn, weaving a palette of indigenous ingredients into a striking collection of dishes. A soup of pureed squash takes on the sultry scent of mesquite-charred hahl with hits of sweet i’itoi onion and tart red berry dust. A mélange of pickled veggies join cactus shoots, planted in rye soil and bathed in saguaro mist, creating a wild to behold and wilder to eat vegetable forest. And meaty buffalo tenderloin joins asparagus-scented cholla buds and tepary beans, sweetened by saguaro syrup. Kai has one foot in the past, but it’s looking to the future. Here’s hoping fine dining of this caliber continues to have one.\n\nDetails: Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, 5594 W. Wild Horse Pass Blvd., Gila River Reservation.

Iridescent exterior paint job aside, Las 15 Salsas looks like any old neighborhood taco joint, conjuring visions of greasy gorditas and immolated carne asada. What it contains, however, is an explosive menu of regional Mexican specialties, from crisp, bean-smeared tlayudas to thick, steaming molotes. The heart and soul of the menu is an assortment of moles — all five of them. Hernandez serves the familiar rich and ruddy mole coloradito and the popular chocolate-spiked mole negro, bursting with the complexity of burned chiles. But she also slings a vibrant, herb-dense mole verde; a smooth and lightly sweet mole Amarillo; and the even harder to find mole estofado, which plays like a Mexican-Mediterranean mashup. Bring some friends and try them all. Object lessons don’t get much more delicious than this.\n\nDetails: 722 W. Hatcher Road, Phoenix.

Maybe we got a little carried away with the notion that our pizza needed a seal of approval from overseas. But it speaks to Justin Piazza’s care and attention to detail that his pizzerias are one of only two restaurant groups in the Valley to get the official benediction from Napoli. What Piazza prepares, both in his Glendale and downtown Phoenix locations, is a faithful rendition of the classic — flour, water, olive oil and salt crafted into a chewy, flavorful dough with a blistered cornicone and a paucity of quality toppings. None of which is to downplay the antipasti, paste and more heavily laden pizzas, but the menu’s raison d’être is anything with the initials “D.O.C.” at the end.\n\nDetails: 5803 W.

Our local fare is represented by a range of Mexican restaurants, some more closely resembling the traditional fare of northern Mexico and some — like La Piñata — more heavily influenced by American conventions. This joyously colorful retro AZ-Mex stalwart is where you go for ladlefuls of tingling chile sauce, gobs of sour cream and oodles of melty yellow cheese, a breed of naturally occurring fusion fare all its own. Cheese crisps are a model for the genre, but even more decadent is the Mary Lou — a stoner mashup of a dish that folds an entire cheese crisp around a core of molten red or green chile. Enchiladas are soft and tender, filled with flavorful meats and completely smothered in a ruddy, spicy bog of chile sauce. Crunchy tacos and flautas are piled with chopped tomato and icy crisp shredded lettuce. Even though I’m an unadorned chimichanga evangelist, here’s the place where letting them smother that crisp shell in a bucket of sauce feels like the only way to go.\n\nDetails: 5521 N. Seventh Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-279-1763, lapinatarestaurantaz.com.\n\nLamp Wood Oven Pizzeria\n\nChris Bianco inspired a generation of Arizona pizza makers and, simply put, Matt Pilato is one of the best. In a town bursting at the seams with wood-fired pizza, Pilato has focused an obsessive attention to detail on local conventions to create a signature style that’s descended from Bianco, but entirely his own. Oft overlooked due to its distance from the city’s core, Lamp serves a pizza that’s modestly topped, roundly flavored and crisper than most. Pizza menus that stretch into double-digit offerings tend to get diluted, but every one of Pilato’s 28 creations is well-balanced and carefully thought-out. The Scientist offsets a plethora of salumi with dense, meaty Castelvetrano olives. The Gepetto takes a sweet and pungent route, pairing Pilato’s boozy house sausage with caramelized onions and blue cheese. And though it’s one of Phoenix’s prime specimens, the pizza isn’t even the best thing on the menu. That title belongs to the mignulata, a type of Sicilian bread that sports a tender, layered core stuffed with pungent onions, sausage and pecorino enveloped in a crackling crisp crust.\n\nDetails: 8900 E.

Jones had been around the block, cheffing his way through a series of Valley gigs before hitting his stride with a lunch-counter version of The Larder + The Delta. Now, finally with his own space and kitchen, he’s turning up the heat. His modern Southern fare with a little local flair and a dash of Chicago soul is electric, and now it’s unchained. The Low Country perlou has gotten a king-size upgrade, its Carolina Gold rice now piled with clams, mussels and colossal prawns. A Two Wash Ranch chicken strikes a pose, one talon in the air, resting on a panzanella built on cucumber, Arizona melon, cornbread and plenty of sweetened vinegar. But perhaps nothing exemplifies Jones’ work more than his hoppin’ John. Some call it sacrilege, but pulling out the pork to put the focus on the sizzling rice, red peas and herbs is like seeing the flavors through a microscope for the first time. The Larder + The Delta was already one of the Valley’s most exciting spots. Now we get to see what Jones can really do.\n\nDetails: Portland on The Park, 200 W. Portland St., Phoenix.

This is as informal as it gets. Grab a ticket, mark off a few selections, poke your head into the kitchen and try to flag down somebody to take your order. Wedge yourself into a tiny table, and in a matter of moments you’ll be feasting on pani puri, diminutive spheroid crisps ready to be stuffed with potato and chickpeas and a splash of tamarind chutney. Papri — small, thin wafers — are smothered with yogurt, a mix of fragrant chutneys and sev, a flurry of tiny, crisp noodles. The bada paav — a fried potato burger, for lack of a more elegant description — is hearty, playfully spiced and served up on a no-frills sesame burger bun. And a panoply of sultry curries and stewed vegetables stand at the ready for sipping and dipping. Plates are small and the prices are smaller, making it easy for those unfamiliar with chaat to dive in and explore.\n\nDetails: 1813 E. Baseline Road, Tempe.

Though the Valley was awash in barbecue joints before Scott Holmes hit the scene, a couple of exceptions aside, they ranged from serviceable to shameful. But even the standouts couldn’t touch the product Little Miss BBQ put out from day one: A trayful of succulent smoked meat that turns dedicated carnivores into blubbering fools willing to stand in line for hours in 115-degree heat. Holmes has achieved a quantum leap in Valley barbecue, and now, everybody else — some respectably so — is playing catch-up. It has become an arms race, folks, but Holmes still holds the ultimate doomsday device: A peppery smoked brisket that oozes fat with a gentle nudge, flakes into silky bliss on the roof of your mouth and packs a smoky wallop. Taking nothing away from Holmes’ ribs, house-made sausage and killer grits and beans, the fatty brisket is the dish that pushed Phoenix barbeque to the next level.\n\nDetails: 4301 E.

It’s easy to quip that Phoenix is still green, an immature city without a strong sense of history and time. Then you descend the narrow staircase for a special dinner in the timber-supported basement at The Hermosa Inn where Megargee (reputedly) sold bootleg hooch and hosted illicit gambling, and it’s a stark reminder that the history is here if you’re willing to look. Lon’s at The Hermosa is bursting with rustic charm, not to mention the beauty of one of the best dining terraces in town, and Jeremy Pacheco is so perfect for the place he came to work here twice — returning after a stint in Las Vegas because he couldn’t stay away. This is contemporary dining, but there’s a lingering hint of cowboy cuisine in Pacheco’s menu, from a smoky tortilla soup with pulled chicken to a confit duck crepe with spiced mole to gorgeous pecan-roasted lamb. If Mangalitsa is on the menu, don’t miss it. Pacheco knows his swine.\n\nDetails: Hermosa Inn, 5532 N. Palo Cristi Road, Paradise Valley.

Peruvian is such a fascinating cuisine, blending Spanish, Japanese, African, Italian, Chinese and indigenous influences into a complex jigsaw puzzle where you can still see the seams but the pieces fit perfectly. The Valley’s Peruvian restaurants all have their specialties, but I find myself returning to Los Andes for dishes like fiery ceviche plied with sweet potato and onions and spiked with pisco. Causa — cool mashed potatoes tarted up with lime and yellow chiles and layered with shrimp or chicken salad — has a light, fresh pop. And skewers of grilled beef heart bring the smoky, meaty spice. Lomo saltado, always a crowd-pleaser, is a hearty stir-fry of beef and potatoes. Graham makes my favorite aji de gallina in town — a bizarre and utterly comforting dish of chile-spiked stewed chicken in a creamy morass of potatoes, Parmesan and ground walnuts.\n\nDetails: 6025 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

Really, this is all I want in a Puerto Rican restaurant. Now with a little room to maneuver (their previous space could seat eight if everybody held their breath), it’s a little easier to bring a crowd and work your way through a list of Puerto Rican classics, still charmingly unpretentious, served in baskets and Styrofoam trays. Pasteles — pork-laced tamales steamed in banana leaves — have a smooth texture and herbal fragrance. For mains, starch lays down the baseline in the form of rice and pigeon peas or beans with squash; and they pair with luscious meats like roasted pork with a citrus marinade or gloriously tender baked chicken. Plantains are abundant: As crisp tostones, sweetly caramelized amarillos or substituting as bread for the jibarito, which is a steak sandwich laden with cheese, vegetables and garlicky mayo. And the Mofongo is outstanding, a mash of plantains, pork and enough garlic to make you think they buy it by the truckload.\n\nDetails: 1916 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-223-8217, facebook.com/milliescafeaz.\n\nMora Italian\n\nMaybe the most wildly anticipated opening in recent memory, Mora Italian — predictably — has come to rest somewhere between the life-changing culinary experience Scott Conant’s fans were expecting and the overrated faceplant the celebrity schadenfreude crowd was hoping for. Which is to say, this is an exciting place that’s sometimes more solid than sensational, but it can hit some screaming highs when it’s firing on all cylinders. Mora is busy and loud and where you want to be when you want to be seen, managing to stand out even on a strip as brash and brazen as Seventh Street’s new restaurant row. Antipasti like a crisp fritto misto or creamy carbonara suppli hit the mark. But the polenta bosciaola — pairing rich polenta with an intense brew of seasonal mushrooms — is a flat-out stunner. Pastas like the black campanelle — a smart and spicy spin on clam pasta — and meltaway lobster gnudi are strong, and grilled meats and fish can hit similar highs. But the best dish on the menu may still be Conant’s signature pasta al pomodoro, as simple and perfect as they come.\n\nDetails: 5651 N. Seventh St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-795-9943, moraitalian.com.\n\nMowry & Cotton\n\nIt’s tough to stifle a chuckle when the “casual” restaurant at one of the swankiest resorts in town cites Arizona’s dusty, Wild West history as the inspiration for a spare-no-expense space that’s gorgeously appointed in crisp leather and smooth sanded wood. But while Tandy Peterson’s menu displays a sneaky level of refinement commensurate with The Phoenician’s usual luxury, it’s applied to dishes that evoke a kind of rustic sass. Mowry & Cotton’s stunning oven is a far cry from a campfire, but char and smoke permeate her creations. Robust, earthy flatbreads take atypical toppings like mushrooms with apricots and horseradish. Smoked yogurt and mustard greens dress barbecued beets; and crisp roasted potatoes are plied with fiery chorizo and hot sauce. A whole bass turned inside out and roasted to a juicy crisp makes for delectable do-it-yourself tacos. And grilled pheasant — deeply lacquered with an anchovy wash and buried beneath broccolini, almonds, citrus and cherries — is a remarkable dish.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E.

Hartman slings what might be the best brisket in town not made by a guy named Holmes. He does it with a Southern Pride smoker, which usually raises the floor and lowers the ceiling. I say “usually” because Hartman plays an instrument designed for volume like a virtuoso, coaxing a surprising level of subtlety out of meat that’s more gently seasoned than some of the widely popular styles — everyday rather than occasion barbecue, if you will. Of course, brisket isn’t the be-all and end-all. His ribs, pulled pork and hot links join some solid sides to make for one of the most consistently excellent barbecue options in town. Sauces are numerous and thoughtfully concocted, but they’re best used sparingly. The place is called “Naked” for a reason.\n\nDetails: 2340 W. Bell Road, Phoenix, 602-439-4227. MAP IT!

Among the best of the newcomers is Nishikawa Ramen, which recently opened a second Valley location. Nishikawa serves solid gyoza and surprisingly excellent takoyaki, crisp and creamy with a nice nugget of octopus in the center. But the ramen is the thing here, and pork broth is Nishikawa’s medium. It’s a creamy and rich tonkotsu with a luscious, clean scent, and it serves as the base for six bowls, all of which are quite good. The straight tonkotsu with skinny Hakata-style noodles is lush, with tender pork chashu and a bump of pungent fish powder. Nishikawa’s miso ramen substitutes a more substantial kinky noodle along with the requisite corn, while the curry ramen is a nice change of pace. The signature bowl, however, is Nishikawa’s best. Laced with black garlic oil and fried onion, the Nishikawa Black lends a nice allium pungency and sweetness to an already exquisite broth.\n\nDetails: 1901 E. Ray Road, Chandler.

In a rare victory for quality and care, Raducha is now rightly recognized as one of the Valley’s most important bread makers, and his “modern wood-fired deli,” Noble Eatery, carries that ethos through to the lunch counter. Tender ciabatta is stuffed with fresh mozzarella and slivered finocchiona. Robust toast is smeared with creamy ricotta and topped with roasted mushrooms. The wheaty crust of a diminutive pizza is topped with potatoes and a whiff of rosemary. The tuna salad, gently dressed with olive oil and premium vinegar, is still a showstopper. At a time when most “feel-good” eating is factory-farmed bird food, we need more of this breed of rugged culinary honesty.\n\nDetails: 4525 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Nobuo Fukuda serves dazzling food that’s smart and precise. But the way he has so naturally married the techniques and ethos of his native Japan to the soul and flavors of Arizona is what makes his work unique. In a historic building subtly adorned with Japanese accents, his contemporary izakaya gracefully marries East and West, pairing tako with tomato and mozzarella, hamachi with grapefruit and avocado, tuna with roasted beets, and saikyo miso with foie gras. Moreover, Fukuda goes as humble as crisp tonkatsu sandwiched between slices of shokupan at lunch, and as refined as a delicate chawanmushi duo — cold and hot — served by appointment at the four-seat counter as part of his omakase. If you glimpse beneath the surface, Nobuo at Teeter House is as much about Arizona as it is about Japan. Seeing desert flavors and products focused through a Japanese lens is nothing short of revelatory.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 622 E. Adams St., Phoenix.

Noca was defined by Wexler’s obsessive food-geek palate. Nocawich is no different, slinging a short list of sandwiches and salads composed from stellar ingredients like Biellese salumi, Snake River Farms beef, Russ & Daughters lox and H&H bagels. The Italian Stallion layers killer giardiniera with slivers of fine salumi; and the Clubber Lang, with house roast beef and spicy provolone, conveys all the punch of its namesake. Wexler’s patty melt is a refined take on the genre made with Gruyere and a slick bordelaise; and his “What the cluck?” is probably the best fried chicken sandwich in town, with seasoned fries carefully engineered to a precise crunch. A breakfast burrito spiked with chimichurri crema and crispy potatoes is a game changer. Deep in Arizona State University territory with a menu almost entirely priced in the $8 to $12 range, it’s priced for a student’s budget. Let’s hope they appreciate what a gem they have there.\n\nDetails: 777 S. College Ave., Tempe. MAP IT! 480-758-5322, nocawich.com.\n\nOcotillo\n\nThis place fascinates on a number of levels. Approaching Ocotillo is like entering the quad of a culinary campus — a smartly designed compound that combines restaurant, event space, coffee shop, public park and biergarten all into one. It’s a study in urban oasis, connecting space, food and community. But from a culinary standpoint, Ocotillo is remarkable in the way it takes the spirit of the tiny restaurants that have shaped contemporary Arizona cuisine and finds a way to deliver that upstart ethos on a large scale. Snappy vegetable dishes like smoked beets with ricotta and pistachios or a whole head of cauliflower roasted to a deep, nutty brown with an aleppo vinaigrette and fresh herbs showcase fine produce. Robust pasta dishes like pappardelle in a rich ragu join meaty mains like mesquite grilled chicken, loaded with local honey, dates, citrus and chiles.

Of course, communities need community gathering spots, and Old Town Sarajevo is one of Phoenix’s most prominent, serving Bosnian cuisine since 2001. A casual café gives way to a country village-themed dining room with a short list of hearty fare. Meaty cabbage rolls are splashed with a tomato-laced broth; bean soup is thick and earthy; and pastries stuffed with meat, spinach or cheese are tender and comforting. The pljeskavica, a monstrous spiced meat patty, is mighty fine. But the stars are the cevapi, juicy little veal sausages stuffed into a steaming bread called lepinja with a cloudlike crumb and a crisp, oily crust. The cevapi are as comforting as they are succulent — served with chopped raw onion, kajmak (a close cousin of sour cream called) and ajvar, a sweet and slightly pungent spread made with roasted eggplant and red peppers. The best way to end the meal? Turkish coffee and good conversation.\n\nDetails: 3411 W. Northern Ave., Phoenix.

Ho hum, another little hipster coffee shop with nice-looking pastries and a smattering of breakfast and lunch dishes. But a few bites deep, Ollie Vaughn’s starts to separate itself from the pack. Flaky, buttery almond croissants, lemon poppy-seed cake with a sharply sour glaze and a light, creamy tomato quiche emerge from the pastry case. Ricotta pancakes are gorgeous, light and tender, with fresh fruit compote and real maple syrup. Stellar biscuits can be smothered with sausage gravy or stuffed with eggs, meat and cheese for a build-your-own breakfast sandwich. Green chile pork, in stripped-down fashion, eschews the soupy standard and shoots instead for an understated burn. Hash browns that have a smooth, creamy core with a shattering, golden crisp — above and beneath — are the Olympian ideal of the form. Lunch excels as well, with a “Cuban” sandwich that features the green chile pork and an almost pungent tuna salad with the sweet-spicy punch of jalapeño marmalade. And to nobody’s surprise, Ollie’s coffee game is strong.\n\nDetails: 1526 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix.

But the true depth and breadth of this pillar of the Chinese culinary pantheon is poorly understood in the West, and better revealed at Original Cuisine than anywhere else in the Valley. A new wave of contemporary Sichuan cuisine — rooted in tradition but pushing creative boundaries — has washed over California and finally reached Arizona, where it rests in a well-tended whitewashed box of a restaurant in Mesa’s Asian market district. You can get the saline sting of fuqi feipian; the chile-laced tingle of Chongqing chicken; and a ginger- and garlic-packed mapo dofu, to be sure. But you can also get tender meatballs and slivers of winter melon in a simple, silky broth; moan-inducing slices of slippery pork belly dipped in a pungent sauce; and pickled Sichuan “kimchi” that’s gently tart and almost effervescent. The menu isn’t quite the murderer’s row that it was when the restaurant first launched, but this is still next-level Sichuan fare in a town that desperately needed it.\n\nDetails: 1853 W.

Now, with the new Gallo Blanco’s simplified menu, Otro stands in starker contrast. They’re both rooted in the same earth, but like the difference between Gallo’s corn tortillas and Otro’s flour tortillas, they explore some of the same themes in different ways. Both have killer breakfasts and sharp salads in common, but Otro maintains the more contemporary taco style, plying succulent pork belly with a sweet glaze and tomatillo relish; or chicken with mushrooms, poblanos and aji amarillo. Mains cast a wider net, letting Robson explore his Vietnamese heritage a bit with fresh spring rolls or caldo de pollo — chicken pho in disguise on a Mexican menu. Spanish and New Mexican influences play stronger as well. And if you’ve been skipping the burgers because who gets burgers at a Mexican restaurant, you’ve been making a huge mistake. They’re some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 6035 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

It would be easy to say a chef like Urciuoli belongs in the kitchen of a fine-dining restaurant, but he’s after something bigger. Pa’La is culinary populism at work, a declaration of war on the notion that premium ingredients and refined presentations should be reserved for the well-heeled. At Pa’La, a spartan counter-service joint in a blue-collar neighborhood, Urciuoli serves simple tapas composed of perfect ingredients. The Italian native pairs imported mozzarella and burrata with roasted vegetables. He bakes bread to order and fills it with roasted wood-grilled skate wing and sizzled Spanish sausage. And he tops his Ramon Navarro bowl — a blend of ancient grains, beans, nuts and seeds dressed with premium oils and vinegars — with whatever smoky, charred seafood strikes his fancy that day. Put these dishes on fine china instead of paper plates, add a ritzy room and service staff, and he could charge quadruple the price. But that would be missing the point, wouldn’t it?\n\nDetails: 2107 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Restaurateur Aric Mei — also involved in the forthcoming Los Olivos Farm project — has become something of an urban farming evangelist. So nearly a decade into its run, The Parlor has gone from neighborhood Italian restaurant to a working lab where Mei tries to practice what he preaches. On the surface, this is any old casual, contemporary Italian joint, slinging pizza, pasta and salads. But something as simple as lightly sweet caponata bruschetta sings, supported by excellent produce and careful balance. Salads based on mixed greens, usually a throwaway, are atypically bright and crisp. Pastas with substantial bite are generously dressed with rich ragus. And the pizzas, a light and chewy variety, are smartly dressed. Sausage is fine, but sausage with grilled radicchio and sage is compelling. A pizza puttanesca laden with tender, spicy seafood is a delight. And when summer rolls around, the sweet pop of roasted corn and chiles with a touch of spicy crema is impossible to resist.\n\nDetails: 1916 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

Husband-and-wife team Walleye Lai and Tina Truong started by selling exotic fruit from the back of a van before moving the operation to Winglee Market, a partnership with a California poultry farm that specializes in breeds of chickens popular with Asian chefs. These stellar birds make the Truongs’ lightly seasoned chicken pho some of the best in town. But there’s a lot more to Pho Winglee, the market’s next-door companion restaurant. Fried chicken wings are piping hot, paper-crisp and encased in a salty-sweet fish sauce lacquer. Grilled meats served with broken rice are tender and juicy. Rice vermicelli is topped with perfect spring rolls; shrimp paste wrapped in lacy crisp tofu skin and sweet, smoky slivers of pork. Pho Winglee isn’t substantially different from other Vietnamese spots that dot the landscape. But it’s fresher, crisper and more flavorful than the rest.\n\nDetails: 111 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

It’s tempting to tell the whippersnappers to remember their history. Sure, it’s everywhere now, but this kind of pizza didn’t exist in this town before Bianco. I want to respect differences of opinion, while digging into one of Bianco’s pies, but I find it hard to accept that the anti-hype is anything but pure contrarianism. This is outstanding pizza with a depth of flavor built on heritage grains and a crisp and craggy character forged in the wood oven, simply topped with vibrant ingredients expressed at their peak. What’s more, at the Town & Country location, the pasta may be even better. Bianco is as much an ethos as a name, one that reveres local agriculture, seeks to extract the most from every ingredient and is constantly seeking honesty, both from the dishes themselves and the people who make them. It’s all right there on the plate.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 623 E. Adams St., Phoenix, 602-258-8300. MAP IT!

But it has evolved into something more — a local restaurant group that has harnessed popular Italian fare and elevated its integrity without sacrificing its broad appeal. Restaurateur Stefano Fabbri runs a boisterous, contemporary establishment. His collection of wood-fired pizzas and fresh pastas is a delectable, never-ending work in progress that pushes diners just a little bit further with each successive year. VPN-certified (that’s food geek speak for “hardcore traditional”) Neapolitan pizzas, such as the margherita and bufala verace, do a fine job of conveying the style’s chewy countenance, bubbling cornicone and straightforward adornment. But less conventional items like the charred, paper-thin, Rimini-style pizzas and the cheese-stuffed focaccia di Recco can steal the show from the main event, and Pomo slings a mean lasagna to boot.\n\nDetails: 8977 N.

More to the point, Dustin Christofolo is helping purge the antiquated notions of desert cuisine from our systems, replacing them with something gorgeously delicate and refined, and grown — to a large extent — right on the property’s farm. The charming farmhouse and some of the most serene, romantic outdoor dining around would make this a popular destination even if the kitchen were in shambles. Thankfully, it’s quite the opposite. Christofolo shares creations that border on ethereal, such as uni removed from its usual umami bomb context and offset instead by light, pickled kohlrabi, grapefruit and meringue. His beef carpaccio, on crisp bread spoons with tempura-fried herbs and a light blue cheese aioli, borders on precious. Even a tangle of sausage-studded cappellacci is lightened with cauliflower, spigarello and a whiff of tarragon. The rest of the world may see the surrounding country as a harsh, if beautiful, wasteland. But here is food that gives a stage to the fruits of the desert more rarely seen and appreciated.\n\nDetails: The Farm at South Mountain, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix.

She opened this Scottsdale institution nearly 25 years ago, but unlike so many moldering relics of the era that now feel clumsy and dated, Rancho Pinot is as fresh and relevant as any newcomer to the scene. Filled with California- and Italian-influenced classics you can ease into like a worn leather chair, the menu’s focus on pure flavor, unfussy presentations and classic comforts is at once timeless and squarely on trend. A round of house-pulled burrata is a rich and creamy morsel, whether paired with a stone fruit relish or swimming in a roasted tomato broth. Grilled quail are succulent and sweet; and delicate gnocchi are nestled into a rich lamb ragu. But Nonni’s Sunday chicken, simply braised with mushrooms and white wine and paired with crisp polenta, exemplifies Rancho Pinot’s appeal. Restaurants new and old struggle to show this kind of grace and maturity in their food, but Robertson, as always, makes it look easy.\n\nDetails: 6208 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

Fortunately, it’s an enviable one. Reathrey Sekong is the kind of charming and tasty spot that food geeks dream of opening. Mother-and-son team Lakhana and Yuth In serve a list of Khmer specialties even more colorful and vibrant than the surroundings, which is saying something given the room’s neon paint job. Pleah, a Cambodian salad made here with marinated raw beef, is a light and pungent affair, cool and plied with fresh herbs. Soups are superb, in particular a lemongrass-scented number with coconut and a touch of tangy tamarind to lend a bracing sourness. The Phnom Penh noodle soup, fortified with pork liver and intestines, is offally good (sorry). For those less inclined toward organ eatery, the lok lak beef is tender stir-fried beef in a French-influenced sauce. But my favorite might be the humble cha kreung, simple chicken stir-fried with a seasoning paste pounded so fresh you can pick out the individual flavors of lemongrass, ginger, galangal, lime leaf, turmeric, shallot, garlic, chiles... every single component.\n\nDetails: 1312 E.

Alejandro Bonilla’s family is indigenous to the region, and he shares them from a modest, cozy storefront joint in west Mesa. Restaurant Huauchinangos slings some of the usual fare you’ll find at any local Mexican restaurant, but what makes Huauchinangos distinctive is dishes like the molotes, 3-inch masa torpedoes stuffed with potato and chorizo, fried to a golden crisp and drenched with tomatillo salsa. The quesadillas are folded over fillings like chicken tinga or mushrooms and cheese, then fried to a delicate crisp, tender to the touch and molten at their core. Bonilla’s “huauchitlacoyos” — a portmanteau of Huauchinango and tlacoyos — are piled with cactus and smoky salsa mora and excellent paired with salty, seared cesina. And chicken is usually a winner, whether it’s Bonilla’s family recipe for mole, a swirling mix of spices, chiles and nuts; or served con cacahuate — smothered with a sauce made of crispy chopped peanuts with the intense, fruity sting of dried chiltepin chiles.\n\nDetails: 1620 E.

But there is compelling work being done here with ultra-superior ingredients, including some of the city’s best nigiri sushi, a compact list made with slabs of premium fish, delicate rice and real wasabi. Creative sashimi are also strong, like butterfish tataki wrapped around crisp white asparagus with a touch of herb and yuzu. The miso-marinated black cod is a refined take on the izakaya staple. And I’m more than a little enamored of their slabs of tender sweet potato with a hefty dose of binchotan-induced char and a ginger-laced glaze. But you most likely came for the steaks, and they’re excellent, whether a charred rib eye with a soy vinaigrette, juicy skirt steaks with an herbal shiso chimichurri or imported Japanese beef that inhabits “if you have to ask” territory. Heck, even the beef and kimchi gyoza are sharp, a compelling take on a dish that’s usually a throwaway, even when it isn’t frozen.\n\nDetails: 7299 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

In a charming, refurbished space built from the bones of a historic Chinese market, Bianco has teamed with Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez of Tacos Chiwas to open what could be best described as an Italian-influenced Chihuahuan diner. In practice, that means flaky cabeza empanadas with an earthy garbanzo bean dip; cheesy entomatadas bathed in the essence of summer tomatoes; chile colorado with the desert’s smoky, fiery sting; and “quesadillas” that look like pizzas, taste like Mexico and resemble precisely no other quesadilla you’ve ever tasted. Best part? Killer ingredients at Denny’s prices. Holguin is the backbone here, and with the sourcing and support provided by Bianco and Hernandez, this is the kind of simple, bold new Arizona cuisine that’s getting Mexican chefs out of the depths of the kitchen and into the spotlight, where they belong.\n\nDetails: 1505 E.

A bit of American brashness meets European sensibilities while drawing in flavors from around the world. Scallop ceviche enriched with uni panna cotta bathes in a smoky, dashi rich broth. A gorgeous grilled langoustine tops Thai-inspired sausage with the gentle sourness of fermented rice. Risotto prepared with phytoplankton is a deep-green chlorophyll bomb.

A vaccination clinic in its third week of operation in Lauderdale County has provided about 500 doses, but project manager Mike Melton told WAAY-TV the site could easily provide 500 shots a day “if the demand was there.” In metro Birmingham, where a mass vaccination site was set to open Wednesday at an outlet mall, some questioned whether the facility was even needed since so few people have shown up at an immunization site at the Birmingham Crossplex, an indoor sports facility. WBMA-TV reports it visited three vaccination locations Tuesday, and none had lines or were requiring appointments. Jefferson County’s top health official, Dr. Mark Wilson, said the county couldn’t pass up the opportunity to bring more vaccine doses to the state’s most populated area. Multiple hospitals also have seen a decline in demand for vaccines, said Dr. Don Williamson, president of the Alabama Hospital Association. It’s unclear whether the addition of new immunization sites or low demand are behind the trend, he said, but some hospitals are looking at scaling back vaccination programs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Railroad has reported that ridership fell by about 94% between 2019 and 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. While 522,000 people rode the Alaska Railroad in 2019, only 32,000 people rode it last year, prompting a loss of about $8 million for the state-owned company, Alaska’s News Source reports. The railroad also moved 26% less freight in 2020 compared to 2019. A railroad spokesman, Tim Sullivan, expressed optimism that there will be more riders and freight this summer as vaccination rates increase and tourism rises. “We are on the bucket list of a lot of people,” Sullivan said. “You see all the time, when people say they’re coming to Alaska, one of the things they want to do is be on the Alaska Railroad.” The railroad’s main route main route stretches from Seward to Fairbanks and has a stop in Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Federal coronavirus relief funding will help schools hire 140 counselors and social workers as children return to classrooms with pandemic-induced stresses and isolation, Arizona schools chief Kathy Hoffman said Monday. Hoffman said the $21 million plan will provide two years of funding to eliminate a waitlist for mental health professionals requested by schools in 2019. State lawmakers that year expanded a school safety grant program that had long funded police officers to also cover counselors, but demand outstripped the available funding. The $21 million in federal coronavirus relief will run out after two years. Hoffman called on the GOP-controlled Legislature to permanently fund the new hires, saying her agency is “stepping in where the Legislature has failed to act.” Even with the new positions, Arizona’s student-to-counselor ratio will still be too high, she said. Hoffman said she’s taking steps to boost the social and emotional well-being of students, including those struggling after the pandemic upended schooling and everyday life in what she called a “genuinely traumatic year” for kids. “Our students are facing weighty, weighty issues as we return to in-person learning,” said Sarah Skemp, a counselor at Lake Havasu High School and board chair of the Arizona School Counselors Association.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Tuesday gave initial approval to measures prohibiting so-called vaccine passports and government-imposed mask mandates. The majority-Republican Senate approved by a 23-8 vote a ban on governments or private entities requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination in order to access goods or services. Federal officials have said there is no plan to require them broadly, but some Republican governors have nonetheless issued orders preventing businesses or agencies from mandating them. “We can either address it today, or we can allow it to steamroll us over,” Republican Sen. Trent Garner, who proposed the legislation, said before the vote. The bill now heads to the House. The majority-Republican House, meanwhile, approved a separate measure that would prohibit state agencies or local governments from imposing mask mandates. GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson last month lifted the state’s mask requirement but said cities could continue enforcing their own. Little Rock and Fayetteville have imposed face-covering rules. The measure, which the House passed on a 69-20 vote, heads back to the Senate for a final vote. Hutchinson had previously said he would veto the mask mandate ban, but it has since been scaled back to no longer prevent businesses from imposing their own requirements.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A Northern California woman who acknowledged using U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s name and Social Security number to receive $21,000 in pandemic-related assistance pleaded guilty Monday to stealing unemployment benefits. It was part of nearly $200,000 in unemployment insurance and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits contained in debit cards shipped to the home of Andrea M. Gervais, 44, of Roseville, authorities said. She pleaded guilty to theft of government money for filing 97 such fraudulent claims, at least 10 of which were approved by California’s beleaguered Employment Development Department. If all 97 had been approved, it could have brought her more than $2 million, federal prosecutors said. Investigators say overall losses from widespread unemployment fraud will top at least $11 billion. That includes at least $810 million in the names of roughly 45,000 inmates, some of them on death row, according to a state audit in January. Gervais, who worked for the state unemployment agency until she was fired in 2018, could face a maximum of 10 years in federal prison when she is sentenced in August.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: As COVID-19 hospitalizations increase, Gov. Jared Polis announced four sites will begin allowing people to get vaccines without an appointment. As of Wednesday, The Ranch in Loveland, the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo County, Ball Arena in Denver County and the Grand Junction Convention Center in Mesa County all accept walk-ins or drive-ins. “There’s no more excuses,” Polis said. “It’s free, quick and easy at multiple sites across the state.” He said allowing walk-in vaccinations is not indicative of the state having more supply than demand but is an effort to reach those who have put off getting a shot but are not resistant to vaccination. “For those of you who have been putting it off, now’s the time to get it,” Polis said. “Maybe you’ve thought, ‘Hey, I’m 24 and healthy; I want to let my elders get it first.’ Well, guess what? Now it’s your turn.” As of Tuesday, Polis estimated about half of adults in the state are at least partially vaccinated. Colorado conducted two data analyses to determine how effective the vaccines are, and both showed that fully vaccinated Coloradans were 93% to 95% protected against COVID-19. Since late January, there have been 819 cases among fully vaccinated people, compared with almost 107,000 among all Coloradans, state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is turning to music in an effort to get kids more interested in school and help combat the learning loss suffered during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont and state education officials announced Tuesday that Connecticut’s public schools will be integrating a curriculum called TeachRock, the brainchild of Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Steven Van Zandt and his nonprofit Rock and Roll Forever Foundation. The curriculum includes lesson plans in most subjects, tailored to different grade levels, all viewed through the lens of music. Subjects include things like the Vietnam War and protest music, Langston Hughes’ poetry and the blues, and hip-hop and its influence on politics. “Statistics show that if a kid likes one single teacher or one single class, they will come to school, and we want to be that class,” Van Zandt said. “The days of dragging young people to some old-school education methodology, I think, are over.” Lamont said the program ties in perfectly with his push to reengage children who may have fallen behind during the pandemic or have been absent from school altogether. Van Zandt and the TeachRock board – which includes his E Street Band partner Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Martin Scorsese and Bono – developed the curriculum over 15 years with the help of education experts. Van Zandt said it is a response to No Child Left Behind, which he said pushed the arts out of schools in favor of test-based results in core subjects.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Despite increasing vaccination rates, the state is among the nation’s leaders in new coronavirus infections per capita. “It’s an interesting time in which it’s kind of like sunny on one side of the house and raining on one side of the house,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health. “We’re excited that more people are vaccinated, but it’s also very disappointing that we have more cases. We’re just not out of the woods yet.” Over the past week, Delaware has averaged 370 new cases per day, a 70% increase from four weeks earlier. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Delaware ranks fourth among all states in terms of cases per capita over the past week, behind only Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In that time, 6.1% of coronavirus tests in Delaware have been positive, indicating the case increase is not solely due to an increase in tests administered. The World Health Organization has set 5% as the threshold for concern. State officials said there isn’t one specific reason cases are increasing. Most of the spread is coming from household or social events, particularly Easter gatherings. “It’s general community spread,” Rattay said Tuesday. But she said the state is seeing a flattening of cases and deaths among senior citizens.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unemployment insurance has been a huge issue during the pandemic, but the systems to help people in D.C. are not making it any better, WUSA-TV reports. Thousands of people have been stuck in limbo while the city updates its claims website. This week the city said the update is complete, and those residents can return to filing claims on it. But some say they still cannot access their benefits, and now their situation has gotten worse. “The reason that we’re talking by phone is because I don’t have internet access,” Dan Hendry said. “I can’t pay my bills; I can’t pay my internet bill.” Hendry said he is a former city worker who has been out of work since the pandemic began. According to the city, he is one of 2,500 people who got stuck in benefits limbo because of a mid-March update to D.C.’s unemployment claims website. The old site needed the update to meet the requirements of the American Rescue Plan passed by Congress to extend unemployment benefits for people who have been on them for more than a year. The director of the city’s Department of Employment Services, Unique Morris-Hughes, said the update did not affect all weekly filers – about 2,500 of 70,000. The agency has 300 call-takers and 300 caseworkers to help those people, she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Beach: With interest in getting a COVID-19 vaccine waning, Palm Beach County health officials are planning to close their three mass vaccination sites by the end of May and take the shots on the road. While officials expected demand to increase this month when residents as young as 16 became eligible, instead it has tanked, Darcy Davis, CEO of the county’s health care district, told county commissioners Tuesday. Vaccination centers at the South Florida Fairgrounds, the South County Civic Center in Delray Beach and the Burns Road Community Center in Palm Beach Gardens are operating at 50% capacity this week because no one signed up for 10,000 of the 16,000 slots that were available, she said. The use of three mobile units, each capable of vaccinating 500 people a day, will enable health officials to reach minority groups and others who, for whatever reason, aren’t signing up to get COVID-19 shots at the mass vaccination centers or retail locations. “It makes more sense to go to them instead of waiting for them to come to us,” Davis said. As planned, the last first doses will be given at the Burns Road site Thursday, at the South County Civic Center on Saturday and at the fairgrounds May 6. After that, only second shots will be administered.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A concert series kicking off next month will offer a return to outdoor shows that allow for social distancing. Americana string band Old Crow Medicine Show is scheduled to headline the first in the series at Cloverleaf Farm beginning May 28. The all-ages event is the first for Into the Wildwood, a comeback of sorts for the Wildwood Revival Summer Concert Series that took place at the Arnoldsville farm from 2014 to 2019 and was founded by Athens-born siblings Libby Rose and Jesse Collier. Tickets to the May 28 concert are available in private, socially distanced “pods” of two or four people according to the tier package purchased. Food from Maepole and Cafe Racer will be available for preorder or on-site purchase, and the beverage menu will include beer from Creature Comforts Brewing Co. Though the number of shows in the series has yet to be determined, event spokesperson Chad Shearer said organizers anticipate Into the Wildwood to have several pop-ups over the next couple of months, depending on fan response and ability to produce the concerts in a safe, socially distanced manner.

That makes Hawaii the second state in the nation, after New York, to implement a vaccination verification program, state officials said at a news conference Tuesday. The plan does not change anyone’s ability to travel and avoid quarantine by testing negative for the coronavirus, as is currently required for trans-Pacific and interisland travel, but adds another option for Hawaii residents who are 14 days past their final vaccination shot. People must have received their shots in the state to be eligible for the exemption. Gov. David Ige said the state hopes to add the option for trans-Pacific travelers this summer but wants to test the program among island residents first. “Since the very beginning of this pandemic going back to March 7 of last year, Hawaii has had the best outcomes in the nation from the health perspective,” Ige said, noting that the state has had among the lowest infection and mortality rates in the nation. The program will begin May 11. At the onset, vaccination records will be checked manually by people at airports. Soon, travelers will be able to upload their verifications to a state website that is already being used for pre-travel testing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Republican-dominated state House on Wednesday voted to override GOP Gov. Brad Little’s veto of a measure seeking to curb a governor’s power to respond to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers voted 48-19 to attain the two-thirds threshold needed to override the veto and send the measure to the Senate. Its fate in the Senate is uncertain, as lawmakers there on Monday opted not to override a veto of similar legislation to curb a governor’s emergency powers. It’s not clear when the Senate will hold an override vote. Supporters of the measures said the governor has too much power during emergencies. Opponents said the Legislature shouldn’t have emergency authority because it would be too slow to act during a time of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic spurred the legislation, with lawmakers taking aim at rules intended to stem the spread of the virus, such as limiting gatherings and nonessential travel. Legislators were especially incensed that Little imposed a statewide stay-at-home order last spring that limited gatherings, including church gatherings, and classified some workers as nonessential to try to reduce infections and deaths as hospital systems neared collapse.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Several hospitals in northwest and central Illinois are running out of beds because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials say. About a half-dozen hospitals operated by OSF HealthCare had 90% or more of their beds filled Tuesday, chief operating officer Dr. Michael Cruz told the Chicago Tribune. OSF’s St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria was at 97% occupancy, its St. Anthony Medical Center in Rockford was at 96%, and its St. Joseph Medical Center in Bloomington had no available intensive care unit beds, Cruz said. OSF has been transferring patients to other hospitals and moving staff as needed, he said. It’s also having some patients stay in emergency room beds until ICU spots become available. Statewide, 2,288 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Monday night, up from 1,648 about two weeks earlier, the Illinois Department of Public Health said. Amita Health was also near capacity at some of its 14 acute care hospitals in Illinois because of COVID-19 and other factors, said Dr. Stuart Marcus, its chief clinical officer and executive vice president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A year after the Indianapolis 500 was held without a single fan in attendance for the first time ever, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway plans to host up to 135,000 fans for the May30 Indianapolis 500, or 40% of the track’s unofficial capacity, Penske Entertainment Corp. officials announced Wednesday. That number of fans, as well as the track’s health and safety plan, has been approved by the Marion County Public Health Department. At that capacity limit, race day at IMS stands to be the highest-attended sporting event in the U.S. – and potentially the largest enclosed gathering of people – since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic early last year. Mask-wearing will be required and enforced throughout the track unless attendees are eating or drinking. Temperature checks will be required at the gate to receive entry. Social distancing guidelines will be instituted, with fans spaced throughout the track’s grandstands, and enforced elsewhere. IMS is hosting drive-up vaccine clinics throughout May and plans to allow for fans to attend walk-up vaccine centers around the track on some practice days. IMS projects that by race day, nearly 60% of its fans will have been vaccinated, which officials believe, along with mask-wearing and spacing, should ensure safety.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly half of the state’s counties have rejected new doses of COVID-19 vaccine because of a lack of demand, officials said Tuesday amid a public information campaign meant to drum up interest in immunization. Forty-three of Iowa’s 99 counties declined additional shipments, the state reported. Of the 43 counties, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified 12 as having high rates of coronavirus transmission: Clay, Clayton, Dickinson, Emmet, Fremont, Ida, Lyon, O’Brien, Palo Alto, Sac, Taylor and Woodbury. Voter registration information shows that all 12 are heavily Republican counties, which have shown to be more resistant to vaccine acceptance. A poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in late March found that 36% of Republicans said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, compared with 12% of Democrats. Similarly, a third of rural Americans said they were leaning toward not getting shots, while less than a fourth of people living in cities and suburbs shared that hesitancy. The state, Iowa State University and the University of Iowa have hosted live, virtual information sessions on COVID-19 vaccination during which experts answered questions about vaccine creation, safety and effectiveness.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The number of coronavirus variants in the state has risen sharply, even as parents in some schools push to drop masking requirements and as vaccine appointments go unfilled. In the past week, the state had a 32% increase in the total number of confirmed variant coronavirus cases, as all five strains of concern have now been identified in the state, The Wichita Eagle reports. Despite the spread, more parents are challenging mask requirements in schools, with the Mulvane district the latest in the Wichita area to reject a complaint about school rules for COVID-19 control. Parents are raising the challenges under a new state law that requires school boards to use the least restrictive means possible to control the spread of the coronavirus. In rejecting the complaint, school board President Jeff Ellis criticized the law, saying it has “continued to divide the community, divide teachers, divide students, divide board members.” About a dozen parents and students who signed on to the complaint were present in the audience. Most went unmasked in defiance of district rules. “They’re not actually protecting the kids from anything as far as I’m concerned,” said parent Lacy Collins. “To actually protect yourself from the small particles of COVID you’d have to wear a HazMat suit or something. I just don’t feel like there’s any purpose.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Kentucky State Fair Committee members have seen the progress in the commonwealth’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic and, after unprecedented circumstances caused organizers to scale their plans back in 2020, are hoping this year’s celebration looks more like 2019. At a committee meeting Monday afternoon, members voted to recommend Kentucky Exposition Center staffers base plans for the 2021 fair around the “more normalized fair” of 2019, when attendance was not limited by social distancing restrictions, and attendees were free to pack the fairgrounds for rides, shows and deep-fried Oreos. Last year, the fair was not open to the public. The plans aren’t set in stone but are a recommendation to the full Kentucky State Fair Board and can still be adjusted as state officials monitor the pandemic. Modifications to that 2019 plan that could be used as an outline for this year’s fair are “likely,” according to a release from the organization. But committee member Keith Rogers said it’s a “whole lot easier to scale back than it is to scale up, especially when you get into June and July.” The committee’s recommendation – which sets the starting date of the 2021 Kentucky State Fair on Aug. 19, running through Aug. 29 – will be presented to the full Kentucky State Fair Board for approval Thursday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Two professors are asking Louisiana State University’s Faculty Senate to call on the school to require its 34,000 students in Baton Rouge to receive COVID-19 shots before returning to campus for in-person classes next fall. The Faculty Senate will discuss the resolution Thursday afternoon that calls on LSU to add the COVID-19 vaccine to a list of mandatory immunizations for students that includes measles, mumps and other diseases or to implement a COVID-19 vaccine requirement through other means. In the resolution, the professors, Inessa Bazayev and Tara Houston, who teach in the College of Music and Dramatic Arts, cited the growing number of universities around the country that are requiring vaccines and asserted that numerous LSU faculty members have expressed support for the requirement. A copy of the resolution was released Tuesday, a day after interim LSU President Tom Galligan announced that the school could not require vaccinations given that federal regulators approved the COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use without completing full safety investigations. Dr. Jim Henderson, president of the University of Louisiana System, cited the same reason in saying he did not plan to require vaccinations before students return in the fall.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Another private college in the state has said it will require students and staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19 this fall. College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor joined Bowdoin College, which was the first college in Maine to require the new vaccines. College of the Atlantic said Monday that people working and studying on campus in the fall will be subject to the requirement once the vaccines gain full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Bangor Daily News reports. The University of Maine System, the largest university system in the state and Maine’s flagship public education institution, has said it is not requiring them at this time. Meanwhile, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah said the state’s mobile vaccination unit planned to offer COVID-19 shots without an appointment Wednesday and Thursday. Shah said the unit is located in Windham this week and using the Moderna vaccine. He said appointments are still preferable, and walk-ups will only be available on a first-come, first-served basis. The state plans to use the mobile unit to bring COVID-19 vaccines to rural and underserved communities around Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Crime, especially violent crime, spiked in 2020 for the first time in five years, according to statistics from the Ocean City Police Department, which pointed to “cabin fever” as the pandemic dragged on as a factor. The agency reported a 21% increase in a category that includes rape, robbery, assault and other types of crime, according to the 2020 annual report released by Tuesday. “The year 2020 was a challenging time, not just for Ocean City but the entire community, as we fought our way through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” Chief Ross Buzzuro said. “By the time the peak season occurred, individuals were traveling to Ocean City more and more due to cabin fever and wanting to get out.” The report comes as the department and town gear up for the tourism season. This summer is expected to resemble more of a traditional year after COVID-19 travel restrictions and other pandemic-related limits and fear kept some tourists from visiting in 2020. Despite the smaller crowds, Ocean City experienced several notable violent incidents on the Boardwalk last June, including multiple assaults and stabbings, along with a large brawl that left the public and business owners uneasy about safety.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A conservative group on Tuesday called on the governor to lift the state’s outdoor mask-wearing mandate. The Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, in a statement directed to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, argued that most of the state’s most vulnerable residents have been inoculated against COVID-19, and anyone who is 16 or older who lives, works or studies in the state is now eligible to receive a vaccine as of Monday. “It’s time to start taking steps back to normal,” said Paul Diego Craney, spokesperson for the group, which advocates for fiscal responsibility, transparency and accountability in state government. The organization noted that neighboring New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, also a Republican, dropped the state’s outdoor mask order last week but encouraged residents to continue social distancing and wear masks if they cannot. The group also noted that the policy change in New Hampshire doesn’t prevent private businesses and local cities and towns in that state from imposing their own mask rules. Baker’s office didn’t comment, but the governor, as of last week, said he had no immediate plans to drop the mandate. The calls come as medical experts in New England acknowledge it might soon be safe enough for states to lift mask requirements when outdoors.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Grants from $5,000 to $20,000 are being made available for houses of worship struggling financially during the pandemic. Churches, synagogues, mosques and small nonprofits can apply beginning May 3 for funding through the Faith Forward program, the city said Tuesday. Informational sessions about the program begin next Tuesday. The city said $650,000 in funding is available. Major donors include the Troy-based Kresge Foundation, United Way of Southeastern Michigan, and Catholic and Jewish organizations. Grants will be available to eligible organizations providing COVID-19-related community services that include those partnering with the city on vaccine sites. Organizations that provide emergency support services like housing, food and utility assistance, health enrichment for senior citizens, and mental health services also are eligible to apply. “At times like this, we rely on the faith-based community to support us,” Mayor Mike Duggan said in a news release. “Like all organizations, our faith-based partners have suffered during the pandemic as they have served others. The Faith Forward program can help sustain them as they have sustained us.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials are turning buses into mobile COVID-19 vaccine units that will focus on serving communities with a high rate of coronavirus infections. The buses are staffed to provide up to 150 shots per day and are available to community groups that want to host events to deliver shots. The state Health Department said vulnerable areas include agricultural workplaces, homeless encampments and housing complexes where residents lack transportation. Targeted communities include people of color, urban Native Americans and people with disabilities, the Star Tribune reports. “Folks who live in high social vulnerability index communities have had a very disproportionate impact from COVID-19,” state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday. “So this idea of these mobile buses is the next piece of our strategy to get the vaccine into the communities where it is so critically needed.” The retrofitted Metro Transit buses include space for two patients to wait for shots, while two others receive them, said Nicole Nee, a clinician with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. Two buses are being used this week, and the state plans to add four more in coming months.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As businesses and towns look for a way to bounce back from the pandemic, film production could help communities turn a corner. At least three feature-length films have already completed production in the state in 2021, and more are planned for the rest of the year, according to the Mississippi Film Office. Dozens of other films and television shows have already featured Magnolia State locales in their stories over the decades. Even before Bruce Willis-helmed bank heist action flick “A Day to Die” began filming in Jackson this year, Mississippi has long been part of some of Hollywood’s biggest movies, such as 2011’s “The Help.” Nina Parikh, director of the Mississippi Film Office, said besides “A Day to Die,” which will finish filming Friday, five projects have already been completed, with three more in production. Another four are scheduled to shoot this year, she said. On the small screen, Parikh said HGTV’s “Home Town,” which films in Laurel and finished production on its fifth season in 2020, has brought new residents and business opportunities. “People have seen the show, and now they want to live here,” she said. John Gomez, president of Downtown Jackson Partners, said a local crew using local businesses and employing residents means a lot to the community, especially given the pandemic’s impacts.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state’s top public health official resigned Tuesday after four years in Jefferson City and 15 months at the helm of Missouri’s coronavirus response. Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, announced the departure of Dr. Randall Williams, a North Carolina obstetrician brought in by Parson’s predecessor, in a news release commending his service. “Dr. Williams has been a huge asset to Missouri, especially this past year in dealing with COVID-19,” Parson said. No reason was given for the departure. The news release said Robert Knodell, Parson’s deputy chief of staff and a key player in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, will handle Williams’ duties until a permanent replacement is named. Williams leaves the Department of Health and Senior Services after an unusually tumultuous tenure for a state Cabinet official, including dust-ups related to a rare tick-borne illness, Planned Parenthood funding and medical marijuana. When the coronavirus began spreading in earnest, that brought him even more public scrutiny. As the months wore on and caseloads increased, Williams and Parson took more and more criticism for failing to enforce restrictions and declining to issue a statewide mask mandate. The health department was criticized for failing to report tens of thousands of COVID-19 cases until last month.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Benefis Health System will make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for its employees at the beginning of May. “Benefis is a leader in healthcare and we are responsible for doing our absolute best to protect our patients who turn to us in the most vulnerable times,” Benefis said in a statement. “We are also responsible for protecting the employees who support that effort. The vaccines are saving lives and Benefis hopes to be part of this continued effort towards the control of the worldwide pandemic.” To date, about 64% of Benefis employees have received at least a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The state posted 186 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, bringing Montana’s total to 107,379 confirmed reports. Of those, 104,802 are recovered, and 1,025 remain active. There are 66 COVID-19 patients actively hospitalized out of 4,933 total hospitalizations, according to the state’s virus-tracking website. Montana added six deaths since Monday’s report, bringing the total to 1,552 fatalities related to the respiratory illness. There have been 647,928 doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in Montana, which is 4,645 more doses than were reported the previous day. To date, 281,469 residents are fully immunized.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Test Nebraska, a partnership between the state and Nomi Health, reached a milestone last week, surpassing 750,000 coronavirus tests given in communities throughout the state over the past year, according to the state health department. “Test Nebraska was – and remains – one of the only programs in the country offering burden-free testing,” Gov. Pete Ricketts said in a statement. “This model ensures that Nebraskans are not required to show a doctor’s note or proof of insurance to access a COVID-19 test.” Residents can visit TestNebraska.com, or TestNebraska.com/es for Spanish, to schedule an appointment. Those with questions about testing or results and those who need help completing the online assessment can call the Test Nebraska hotline at (402) 207-9377.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Lawmakers in the city are linking plans to fully lift distancing restrictions beginning May 1 with vaccination rates in the state’s key tourism region, while Reno-area businesses could soon have no capacity limits and voluntary distancing rules. County lawmakers in the state’s two most populous areas approved separate plans Tuesday for consideration Thursday by the state’s COVID-19 Response Task Force appointed by Gov. Steve Sisolak. The Democratic governor has set a June 1 date to lift almost all coronavirus mitigation restrictions, except statewide mask mandates that will remain in place indefinitely. Several rural counties moved so quickly last week to relax restrictions and reopen businesses that the governor this week reminded officials that local plans can take effect no earlier than May 1. The Clark County Commission, with jurisdiction over the Las Vegas Strip, adopted a plan involving multiple area agencies to increase occupancy to 80% by May 1 and decrease the required social distancing between people from 6 feet to 3 feet. Capacity limits – currently at 50% statewide – and distancing rules would be lifted completely once 60% of Clark County’s 1.8 million eligible residents receive at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center has started a post-COVID-19 program for people feeling shortness of breath, fatigue and body aches, rapid heartbeat, memory issues and other symptoms more than three months after they became infected. The center said in a news release Tuesday that the program for so-called long-haulers is the first in northern New England and will provide access to a 10-member medical team led by an infectious disease specialist. “We probably are only at the beginning of the impact of this virus,” Dr. Michael Calderwood, chief quality officer, said Wednesday. “We continue to learn about this virus and about post-COVID-19 symptoms, and these types of care centers are going to be really important as we think about our comprehensive and coordinated approach to COVID-19 aftercare.” Patients with Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome account for about 10% to 30% of those who contract the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: The Passaic County Sheriff’s Labor Assistance Program is back after more than a year’s hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. SLAP works with counties to allow nonviolent offenders to fulfill their sentences without incarceration through labor to many municipalities and organizations. Its absence became all too apparent this spring as roadside trash piled up. Among the jobs the crews perform is the removal of trash along roadways, highways and off-ramps. After a year’s hiatus, a number of the mayors in the area said the program’s presence was missed. “It was important to have the SLAP program restart operations,” Passaic County Sheriff Richard Berdnik said. “We started back this week, with four offenders, and it is our hope to get back to pre-COVID numbers as the public health environment continues to improve.” Sheriff’s officials said a number of factors made the reactivation of the program possible, including warmer weather, a declining coronavirus infection rate and an increase in the number of vaccinations. “They are needed,” Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh said, noting that in a section of the city’s highways including Route 20, trash is particularly noticeable. “Urban areas need more attention.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State labor officials are responding with reassurances to an onslaught of complaints about increased tax rates on businesses to support unemployment insurance. In addition, the state intends to extend the time employers can file appeals if they suspect inappropriate tax increases. A long list of business groups including the New Mexico Business Coalition began writing to the the Department of Workforce Solutions in February to express concern about calculations for increased unemployment tax rates and premiums. They are questioning the state’s compliance with a state pandemic relief law that omits any layoffs from March 2020 through June 2021 from consideration in setting insurance rates. The provision was enacted during a special legislative session in June 2020. Workforce Solutions Department spokeswoman Stacy Johnston said rate changes are based on a three-year average that can increase even as the state abides by the blackout period. “A tax rate may have gone up due to benefit charges that took place in the three years prior to March 1, 2020,” Johnston said in an email. “This is the most likely cause for an increase based on our review.”\n\nNew York\n\nUtica: Twenty children and teenagers tested positive for the coronavirus, and 300 students are under quarantine, after dance school students with virus symptoms attended a competition in central New York, county officials said. Multiple students from a dance school in the Utica area participated in a competition Saturday, in nearby Syracuse, despite experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. The students later tested positive, Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente said at a news conference Tuesday. “This is our largest cluster, our fastest cluster, and we’re a year into this,” Picente said. The 20 people connected to the dance school cases who have tested positive range from 6 to 17 years old and are from several school districts, Picente said. The Whitesboro Central School District near Utica resumed in-person learning Wednesday, a day after going fully remote because of the exposures. Superintendent Brian Bellair told the Observer-Dispatch of Utica that he expects about 300 students from a mix of grade levels, including a few entire elementary classes, to be under quarantine. Picente said the dance school, which he didn’t identify, failed to practice proper pandemic protocols. “Carelessness is preventing us from returning to normal and punishing the people who are doing all the right things,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Gov. Roy Cooper said Wednesday that he expects to lift almost all restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic June1 but will keep the state’s mask mandate in place. Restrictions limiting capacity at indoor restaurants, bars and concert venues are among those that will be lifted, as are limits on indoor and outdoor gatherings. “With increasing vaccinations and ongoing work to slow the spread, I anticipate we’ll be able to lift all mandatory social distancing, capacity and mass gathering restrictions by June 1,” Cooper said. The existing order expires April 30. Cooper said he’ll issue a new order next week with safety restrictions for May. The current order limits most outdoor gatherings to 100 people and indoor gatherings to 50 people. Retail establishments can operate at full capacity under the order, while restaurants are limited to 75% capacity inside. Bars, concert venues and sports arenas are limited to 50% capacity under the order. If two-thirds of adults get vaccinated, Cooper said, North Carolina would likely lift its mask mandate in outdoor spaces. “After June 1, we hope that that mask mandate would only be required for people in public places indoors,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Wednesday that he will lift the state’s COVID-19 emergency declaration at the end of the month as the focus shifts to increasing vaccination rates. Burgum issued the order last March, two days after North Dakota confirmed its first case of the coronavirus. A week later, he ordered people to stay out of bars, restaurants, health clubs, movie theaters and other large-scale venues. Burgum said the decision to lift the emergency shows the progress the state has made in protecting its most vulnerable residents, preserving hospital capacity and making vaccines available to all residents. Nearly 70% of North Dakotans age 65 years and older have received at least one dose of a vaccine, and 64% are fully vaccinated. North Dakota health officials on Wednesday confirmed 178 new coronavirus cases, nine new hospitalizations and two new deaths. More than 106,000 residents have tested positive for the virus, and 1,484 have died since the start of the pandemic. The state currently has no enforced business or event protocols related to COVID-19, though local measures or orders may still be in place. A statewide mask requirement issued Nov. 18 was lifted Jan. 18.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: More people younger than 50 need to get their COVID-19 shots, Gov. Mike DeWine said. “We’ve seen a significant decline in the number of first doses,” DeWine said. To date, 38% of residents have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 27.5% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, according to Ohio Department of Health data. “Unvaccinated Ohioans simply lack the same protection against the virus, which is more contagious,” Ohio’s chief medical officer Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said. “If you’re counting on herd immunity to cover you, you really can’t count on it yet.” Vanderhoff said unvaccinated Ohioans are playing “a COVID-19 lottery.” Local health departments are getting creative to vaccinate residents. For example, the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department is using ZIP code data to offer vaccines in underserved parts of the county, making calls and knocking on doors.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A federal center providing vaccinations to anyone 16 or older opened Wednesday, offering up to 3,000 vaccinations each Tuesday through Saturday for the next eight weeks. The center is operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in conjunction with state and local agencies at Tulsa Community College. Tulsa Health Department Director Bruce Dart said it is hoped the location will provide shots to underserved residents that include Blacks and Hispanics in north Tulsa. The center provides the Pfizer vaccine that is approved for anyone 16 or older. Those ages 16 or 17 must have a parent or guardian present to receive the vaccine. More than 2.5 million vaccinations have been administered in Oklahoma, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Totals of 445,963 coronavirus cases and 8,189 deaths, based on data provided to the federal Centers for Disease Control, have been reported in the state since the pandemic began, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State officials say despite a fourth surge and rising numbers of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19, Gov. Kate Brown will ease restrictions by allowing “indoor full-contact sports” to restart by the end of the week. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the governor’s office and the Oregon Health Authority said the move is in recognition of “the importance of athletics for the physical and mental health of Oregon’s youth athletes,” although the loosened restrictions also apply to adults. Low-contact indoor sports already were permitted, but the new rules for the first time since last spring will allow Oregonians of all ages to engage in indoor basketball, cheerleading, wrestling and water polo, among other sports. Over the past month, new daily coronavirus cases have increased about 150%, including 55% in the past two weeks. That’s faster than the national average, with new cases rising in the United States up 4% in the past two weeks. The number of hospitalized patients in Oregon also has jumped from 106 people a month ago to 255 on Tuesday, roughly a 140% increase. In the past two weeks, Oregon’s number of COVID-19 patients has grown by 49%, compared with the national average of 10%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state plans to greatly expand its network of COVID-19 vaccine providers as demand for the lifesaving shots begins to slow and as existing vaccinators order fewer doses, Pennsylvania’s top health official said Tuesday. Sending vaccine to neighborhood pharmacies and other smaller providers could potentially make it easier for people in underserved areas to schedule an appointment. The state had slashed the number of providers receiving vaccine by more than two-thirds as the Wolf administration, under pressure to speed shots into arms, redirected the state’s limited supply to hospitals, federally funded health centers, municipal health departments and pharmacies that could quickly inoculate large numbers of people. Smaller vaccine providers who were cut out said the move hurt some of the state’s most vulnerable residents. A new map produced for the Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association’s vaccine task force shows that many of the providers who lost their ability to vaccinate are located in medically underserved areas of the state. “This poorly constructed decision resulted in heightened concerns among citizens relying on those pharmacy providers for vaccine,” Victoria Elliott, the association’s CEO, said via email Tuesday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has been awarded nearly $1.5 million in federal funding to expand efforts to track coronavirus mutations, officials announced Wednesday. The funding comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was included as part of the $1.9 trillion relief bill that President Joe Biden signed last month. The White House recently announced that $1 billion would go to the CDC and state and local health agencies for genomic sequencing to track virus mutations. Gov. Dan McKee said the funding comes at a crucial time. The Rhode Island Department of Health has estimated that more than half of the state’s new COVID-19 cases are caused by variant strains. “Rhode Island is in a race against time with vaccines and variants,” McKee said in a statement. “As we continue to get shots in arms, investing in data collection is an asset that will help protect Rhode Islanders and our neighbors across the country.” The new funding will be used to collect coronavirus specimens, sequence the genetic makeup of viruses and share the data. The funding is expected to be distributed in early May. It’s intended to help respond to existing mutations along with future variants of this and other viruses.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: After more than a year of remote learning for some students, public schools across the state will have to offer students the option of attending full time, five days a week by Monday. The General Assembly passed the law Wednesday, sending it to Gov. Henry McMaster, who has been a vocal proponent of keeping schools open full time throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic. A spokesperson for the governor said he would “happily” sign the bill into law. One addition to the bill will prohibit school districts in the 2021-22 school year from “assigning a teacher to deliver instruction to students simultaneously in-person and virtually, unless it is reasonable and necessary due to extreme and unavoidable circumstances.” If a district determines it’s necessary, the district will have to provide additional compensation to the teacher. Immediately following the passage of the bill, the Palmetto State Teachers Association released a statement saying the bill takes a critically important step: “Over the course of the past year, schools across South Carolina have been forced to create completely new instructional models to meet the needs of students during a generational pandemic. While the legislation wisely provides districts with the ability to use dual modality instruction in ‘extreme and unavoidable circumstances,’ the experiences of students and teachers with this instructional model this school year have clearly shown that it should only be sued in the most exceptional situations.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem has joined a handful of governors who have issued executive orders banning the development or use of so-called vaccine passports. Such documents could be used to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine. South Dakota has resisted government mandates, and the state “is stronger for it,” Noem said Wednesday in a statement. She encouraged all residents to get a COVID-19 shot but said the state will not require it. “We are not going to restrict South Dakotans’ exercise of their freedoms with un-American policies like vaccine passports. In our state, ‘Under God, the people rule.’ And that is how we will operate for as long as I am governor,” Noem said. South Dakota ranks 18th in the country for new coronavirus cases per capita in the past two weeks, and its death rate over the course of the pandemic is eighth-highest, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Masks and social distancing at sports events are no longer a requirement of the state’s high school athletic association, as the state prepares to enter the spring postseason. They remain recommendations. The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association informed schools in a memo this week that it had updated its COVID-19 regulations and considerations, making those two changes. The decision was made in consultation with the governor’s office. “We are not seeing people at outdoor venues wearing them anyway,” TSSAA executive director Bernard Childress said. “We do see them sitting away from each other.” Masks had been mandated at all sports events since the school year began, along with social distancing. The state also had recommended previously that capacities be limited to a third or a quarter and had mandated reduced crowd sizes to allow for social distancing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Residents looking to get a COVID-19 shot will have a few more options to do so this week after Austin Public Health announced Tuesday that it would pilot walk-up vaccine clinics and expand its online appointment system availability. Austin Public Health said walk-up clinics will be held Thursday and Friday from noon to 7:30 p.m., or until doses run out, at the Delco Activity Center in northeast Austin. If all vaccines are administered before 7:30 p.m., staff and volunteers will help residents arriving to the site schedule an appointment to return for their shot. During the walk-up clinics, residents 18 and older can arrive without an appointment. While preregistration is not required, it is highly encouraged, officials said. Health officials also announced expanded appointment scheduling on its website. Scheduling will close Friday at 7 a.m., officials said. Moving forward, the appointment scheduling system will be open from 7 p.m. on Fridays to 7 a.m. the following Friday. The 12-hour Friday closure will allow health officials to finalize the appointment schedule and update times for the following week, officials said. Residents who cannot access the online scheduling system are encouraged to call 311 or 512-974-2000.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State epidemiologist Angela Dunn, who helped Utah navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, is leaving her job to take over the Salt Lake County health department, officials announced Tuesday. Dunn was a little-known public health official before the pandemic hit, and she was thrust into the vital position of helping map out the state’s strategy to deal with a pandemic that has killed 2,174 Utahns. She became a household name and a recognizable face across the state as she spoke at televised weekly briefings, repeatedly urging residents to wear masks and practice social distancing. Dunn sometimes interspersed humor and brevity to lighten the mood during the time of crisis, earning her widespread respect and fans. But her newfound prominence made her a target for people unhappy with state restrictions on businesses and mask mandates. In October, anti-mask protesters gathered in front of Dunn’s house after her personal information was leaked online. “It’s taken a really big toll on my family and myself,” Dunn said after the protest during one of her weekly COVID-19 briefings. “I think it’s really unfortunate we live in a state where people feel that it is OK to harass civil servants.”\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: Northern State Correctional Facility has been declared free of COVID-19, the Department of Corrections says. The all-clear came after five consecutive rounds of testing at the Newport prison found no cases of the coronavirus among inmates. Three cases were detected among prison staff, including one during the most recent round of testing April 15, but contact tracing found that the case posed no threat to the incarcerated population. The outbreak began Feb. 23 when testing found the virus in one staff member and 21 inmates. A total of 179 incarcerated individuals tested positive during the outbreak. “We are thankful the Vermont Department of Health has cleared us from all outbreak protocols,” Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker said in a statement Tuesday. “We are thankful there was not serious illness, and we do not take that fact for granted.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Mental hospitals are struggling with dangerously high numbers of patients, a state official told lawmakers this week. The census numbers are prompting the facilities to delay admissions and are straining law enforcement’s ability to maintain custody of people waiting for treatment, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The state’s eight public mental hospitals for adults are at 96% of their capacity, Behavioral Health Commissioner Alison Land told a committee of legislators studying mental health services Tuesday. Crowding is worst at Central State Hospital near Petersburg, which is 99% full. Land told the committee the pandemic has also triggered an exodus of employees, with hospitals operating at 60% to 75% of full staffing. “The picture is bleaker, not better,” she said. Virginia sheriffs are reporting being stretched thin after responding to psychiatric emergencies that require them to hold people and transport them for treatment. “I’ve had deputy sheriffs tied up for days at a time,” John Jones, executive director of the Virginia Sheriffs’ Association, told the newspaper in an interview Tuesday. “We’re at a crisis point.”\n\nWashington\n\nPort Orchard: A new community vaccination site will open in South Kitsap this week, run by the Kitsap Public Health District and Kitsap County’s Emergency Operations Center. The clinic will be at the Christian Life Center in Port Orchard, where staff will provide about 600 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses Thursday and Friday. Appointments, open to everyone 16 and up, can be made at kphd.timetap.com. “We are excited to expand access to COVID-19 vaccination in South Kitsap with the help of our community partners and volunteers,” Yolanda Fong, community health director of the public health district, said in a statement. “This clinic will make it easier for South Kitsap residents to gain protection against COVID-19 and help slow the spread of the virus across our region.” The location would be the county’s third community vaccination site, alongside locations at Olympic College’s Poulsbo campus and the old St. Michael Medical Center campus in Bremerton. “Our goal has been to scale up our capacity to administer vaccines across our county,” health district spokesman Tad Sooter said in an email. “Now that we have vaccination sites established in Bremerton, Poulsbo, and Port Orchard, we will evaluate which clinics to operate from week to week based on community need, vaccine availability, and staffing.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A vaccine clinic at a casino is welcoming people from outside the state to get their COVID-19 shots as demand declines among residents. “Grateful was what we saw in their eyes,” said Betsy Gambino, a nurse with Berkeley Medical Center who helped administer the shots Tuesday. Without leaving their cars, people can get their vaccine in a parking garage at the Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races in the state’s Eastern Panhandle. The drive-thru clinic is available to anyone 16 or older. Held in partnership with WVU Medicine, the clinic is being held from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday over the next several weeks. “We know our neighbors in surrounding states are struggling, so we’ve opened our borders to allow them to receive their vaccine,” said Donnie Grubb, Berkeley Medical Center’s trauma program manager, who is overseeing the clinic. Gambling might be a unique side trip to getting the vaccine, although the clinic’s roadside advertising does not openly push the facility’s slots and table games. Gambino said a database shows residents from six other states arrived Tuesday, including California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a local worker who hails from Nova Scotia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: For now, the Wisconsin State Fair is a go for August after canceling for the first time in 75 years last summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And if the fair does go on, it won’t be the only chance to see live music at Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis. The park’s Bud Pavilion, one of the park’s largest stages, will host its Wednesday Night Live free concert series from June 9 to July 21 and again from Aug. 25 to Sept. 22. “We’re thrilled to be back in action,” Bud Pavilion co-owner Leanne Hock said in a statement. “Last year devastated so many entertainment and service workers. We’ll once again bring in the best cover bands in southeast Wisconsin with an extended schedule that adds more shows. It’s going to be great to have people back at the Pavilion.” The announcement doesn’t specify what safety protocols might be in place. But on the Bud Pavilion website, organizers suggest Wednesday Night Live “will look a little different.” The pandemic has prompted several summer events to cancel for a second year in a row, including Festa Italiana, Polish Fest, German Fest and Bastille Days. But with vaccinations underway, there’s hope among local festival organizers that conditions will be safe enough for mass gatherings to resume in some capacity this summer.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s unemployment rate has remained better than the national average, signaling a positive trajectory more than a year into the pandemic, a report said. The state Department of Workforce Services Research & Planning Section released a March report Monday that showed the unemployment rate stayed at 5.3% from February to March after a steady run of 5.1% to 5.4% in the past six months, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The national unemployment rate is at 6%, the report said. “From March 2020 to March 2021, unemployment rates decreased in 17 counties and increased in six counties,” the department said. “The largest decreases were reported in Washakie (down from 7.0% to 5.3%), Sublette (down from 9.4% to 7.7%), and Big Horn (down from 7.6% to 6.1%) counties.” The report also showed that unemployment rates rose to 7.9% in Natrona, 6.3% in Converse and 6.6% in Campbell counties. A February jobs report said 26,733 jobs were lost in the state from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020, department officials said. The leisure and hospitality industries lost 10,255 jobs, the mining, oil and gas industries lost more than 4,500 jobs, and local government lost more than 3,100 jobs. The new report showed each of those industries stayed steady from February to March.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/football/blind-football-uganda-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Blind Football: The organization opening up new horizons for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany sounds reverberate around the Kampala field where a large crowd has gathered to watch a football match: the hubbub of a PA system as the players warm up, the muffled murmurs of hundreds of intertwined conversations, and – once the match has begun – the sound of the ball loudly crackling over the grass, allowing players to locate it.\n\nAll the players are visually impaired and reliant on unraveling all these sounds from one another to navigate their way around the pitch, so the crowd falls quiet during the match under the direction of some stewards.\n\nThe match is the brainchild of Blind Football Uganda, an organization founded last year by disability inclusion advocate Jagwe Muzafaru to promote and develop the sport within the country.\n\n‘From a simple idea’\n\nBlind football is an adapted form of five-a-side football, played with an audible ball on a pitch surrounded by “kick-boards” – a physical barrier indicating the touch lines – and without the offside rule.\n\n“It began from a simple idea [after] I had seen football being played by people who were visually impaired abroad. And I wondered if we could start it in Uganda,” Muzafaru tells CNN Sport.\n\nJagwe Muzafaru founded Blind Football Uganda after volunteering at the Uganda Paralympic Committee. Blind Football Uganda\n\nOriginally, Muzafaru used balls designed for goalball – a throwing game created specifically for visually impaired athletes – that disintegrated when kicked, until June 2021 when the donation of a starter kit by the International Blind Football Foundation allowed him to realize his idea of a visually impaired football team.\n\nAlthough football is one of the most popular sports in Uganda, it is not traditionally played by visually impaired people who stick to athletics and goalball.\n\n“[Those sports] don’t accommodate very many people,” Muzafaru says. “Not everybody can easily be in athletics … even goalball requires a lot.\n\n“When you look at football, you can train in one day, then you can start playing – and not everyone plays it, some come in just for fun and that’s the most important [thing]. But the major thing was mainly to widen the scope of what people with vision impairments play.”\n\nJust a year after its formation, Blind Football Uganda now consists of four men’s teams and two women’s teams, containing mixed abilities and classifications.\n\nVisually impaired athletes belong to one of three classifications – B1 for those who are totally blind, B2 for those who have some sight and can see shadows, and B3 for those who have less than 10% functional vision.\n\n“Even if they’re not totally blind, we include them in our activities, we blindfold them, then we give them that feel to play around,” Muzafaru says.\n\nUnder the rules stipulated by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) – the sport’s governing body – only B1 players can compete in blind football, though the goalkeeper must be sighted or partially sighted and is contained within a restricted area.\n\nPlayers wear opaque eye-masks to ensure fairness. Blind Football Uganda\n\nIBSA relaxed its requirements for women’s football in January 2020, allowing all three classifications to play together, and Blind Football Uganda is following this template in case B2 and B3 players are also later included in men’s international competitions.\n\nFor now, the organization is arranging domestic rather than international competition in the form of a league that will coincide with World Cane Day on October 14 and 15.\n\n‘The prices of everything’\n\nDisability sports operate under a web of international structures. As well as IBSA, there are non-profit organizations, such as Para Football, which oversee all forms of Paralympic football, which in turn are governed by their own organizations specific to each disability.\n\n“Globally, the international bodies have to accept that Africa is also part of the world because you can look at … the World Cup for cerebral palsy football … this year. There was no African country that was represented, but they called it the World Cup,” Muzafaru says.\n\nCNN has reached out to the tournament organizers – the International Federation of CP Football (IFCPF) – for comment.\n\nThis disconnect between the international structures and grassroots organizations is evident in Blind Football Uganda’s relationship with IBSA.\n\nAfter building an organization without outside technical knowledge, using only YouTube and the internet for guidance, Muzafaru hopes to share his newfound expertise with the international organizations that promote the sport.\n\n“Everything I’ve been doing, no one from even the international body … has ever even asked us: how are we doing it, how can they come on board and assist us,” he adds.\n\nCNN has also reached out to IBSA for comment.\n\nDespite lacking substantial assistance and with financial constraints currently limiting their ambitions, Muzafaru and his team are finding ways to circumnavigate these challenges by crowdfunding online and improvising some of the equipment required.\n\n“I sit with my team, I tell them, ‘Can we develop something similar to what we saw on TV?’ … So we sit and develop something,” he explains.\n\n“For example, when we look at the ‘[kick] boards,’ we make them out of wood. Then we cover them with some clothing, so that they can’t be harmful whenever somebody knocks on them.”\n\nBlind Football Uganda organizes training as well as matches. Blind Football Uganda\n\nSome financial challenges, however, are proving more difficult to tackle.\n\nAs is the case around the world, rising energy prices are impacting on daily life in Uganda as the price of a liter of petrol has increased from Shs 4,580 ($1.19) in December 2021 to Shs 6,350 ($1.65) in July 2022, according to The Observer, a Ugandan newspaper.\n\n“When you look at the current situation you have in the country, the prices of everything are going up … Last year, you could easily move people, we could fund them and then bring them to trainings … Transporting one person now to a training or to a game, it’s a little bit hard,” Muzafaru says.\n\nVisually impaired people often live with their grandparents in more remote areas after completing school as they are unable to work, he explains, further increasing transport costs.\n\n‘These things create a social life’\n\nIn this environment, Blind Football Uganda’s programs can alter societal attitudes towards people with disabilities and improve the mental health of the participating athletes, particularly following lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Most of the people who are totally blind, ever since when they went blind, they move from home to school, home to school,” Muzafaru says.\n\n“They don’t have any other activities because even their parents limit them. They think that some things may be riskier for them because of the visual impairment they have. When you talk to their parents, when they … see them play, these things create a social life that they haven’t ever interacted with.”\n\nBlind football can be played indoors or outdoors. Blind Football Uganda\n\nSport’s impact on mental health, particularly for people with disabilities, is well documented. In a 2014 study conducted by British Blind Sport, participants named competition, health benefits and social interaction as their primary motivations for playing blind football.\n\n“It helps them from being in a situation such as depression, being lonely, [or] limited when they join or they come and play football,” Muzafaru adds.\n\nUsing social media, Muzafaru intends to grow the organization to regions outside of Kampala, providing more opportunities for visually impaired people to play football.\n\n“People have seen what we are doing, and people have been inquisitive and ask, ‘How can a blind person play?’” he says. “So these sites are also helping me to mobilize people, an audience that comes to our events.”", "authors": ["Issy Ronald Cnn Video Amy Li", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/16/holocaust-survivor-concert-tiger-king-auction-crab-meat-shortage-news-around-states/117044680/", "title": "Holocaust survivor concert, Tiger King auction: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A production line that makes many of Hyundai’s North American vehicles is being halted this week due to a parts shortage. The shutdown will leave about 1,000 regular workers temporarily unemployed for seven days. The problem is that Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama hasn’t been able to get enough parts because of a semiconductor shortage. As a result, production at the plant will be suspended until June 21. “No other downtime for this reason is expected,” said Robert Burns, vice president of human resources and administration. The company “will continue to work with Hyundai Motor Group’s global purchasing team to allocate microchips to its U.S. manufacturing plant to optimize production in the coming weeks and months,” Burns said. About 3,000 people work at the Montgomery plant. Most of them will continue to work this week. That includes maintenance workers, employees processing completed vehicles, and engine shop employees building engines to be delivered to Kia’s plant in Georgia. The plant produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans as well as the Santa Fe and Tucson SUVs. It began rolling out the new Santa Cruz pickup earlier this month after finishing a $410 million expansion. The company will help workers file unemployment claims, Burns said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Wildlife Troopers do not intend to issue a citation to a man recently seen lifting a baby moose over a guardrail in south-central Alaska, though it is illegal to “handle any wild animal in a similar fashion,” an Alaska State Troopers spokesperson said Thursday. Spokesperson Austin McDaniel said Alaska Wildlife Troopers “strongly advise people to stay a safe distance from all wildlife, including moose calves, as the animal may react aggressively towards humans.” Anyone who sees a wild animal that may need help should call the nearest law enforcement agency or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, McDaniel said in an email. Alaska’s News Source reports an Anchorage man, Joe Tate, was driving home Sunday from a fishing trip with friends when he saw a line of cars and a moose in the road on the Kenai Peninsula. Tate said a mother moose was pacing in the road, and a young calf struggled to scale a guardrail to join her. He estimated watching for about 30 minutes. He said he considered calling wildlife officials or law enforcement but worried an accident could occur in the time it would take for them to arrive. Friends with a trailer got between the mother and the calf, breaking the line of sight, Tate said. Another vehicle positioned itself similarly on the opposite side of traffic.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Worm Farm, focused on “turning garbage into food,” is growing produce sustainably in the desert. Worms eat food waste produced by the south Phoenix farm and elsewhere, including a brewery, diverting organic scraps from landfills. The invertebrates turn that into nutrient-rich compost that goes back into the ground and helps plants grow. The farm produces 40,000 to 50,000 worms a week and eliminates 1,000 pounds of waste from Phoenix landfills alone. The food it grows can feed its 10 employees with enough to donate to St. Mary’s Food Bank each week. All branches of the farm form a circle of life. “I’m trying to produce the garden of Eden,” Zach Brooks said. He was in the middle of his second master’s degree in sustainability at Arizona State University when he decided to start the farm, realizing he could put what he was learning into practice as easily as he could buy the materials online. “We didn’t invent anything that’s here on the farm,” he said. “Everything that’s necessary to live a zero-waste life is just a matter of doing it.” The site was the remnants of a cotton farm, its soil difficult for growing fruits and vegetables. “We couldn’t even get weeds to grow,” Brooks said. Nowadays, the soil is wet just beneath the surface, even after days without watering. “I dare you to go any place in Arizona and dig up a square of soil, and you won’t find that kind of life,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Abortion rights supporters asked a federal judge Monday to prevent the state’s near-total ban on the procedure from taking effect while the groups challenge its constitutionality. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the ban, set to take effect July 28. The groups filed a lawsuit last month challenging the ban, which prohibits abortions except those to save the life of the mother. The groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of Little Rock Family Planning Services, a Little Rock abortion clinic, and Planned Parenthood’s Little Rock health center. The groups are also representing a doctor who works at the Planned Parenthood clinic. “Absent an order from this Court, (the ban) will inflict on plaintiffs’ patients significant and irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,” Monday’s filing said. Amanda Priest, a spokeswoman for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, said the groups’ motion “should not come as a surprise to anyone.” “Attorney General Rutledge will be reviewing the latest action and will proceed,” she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A popular trail in Big Sur flanked by redwood trees that leads down through a gorge to a 60-foot waterfall is set to open to the public this week after a 13-year restoration needed when a wildfire destroyed access to it, officials announced Monday. After a $2 million renovation that fixed bridges, retaining walls, railings, steps and signage, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail will open Friday for the public to enjoy, said officials with the California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League, a San Francisco conservation group. To protect sensitive habitat, California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League officials replaced more than 4,150 square feet of asphalt and concrete and seven stream crossings, with the newly aligned trail and a 70-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spans the Pfeiffer Redwood Creek ravine and offers dramatic views, officials said. The Basin Complex Fire damaged the 0.75-mile trail, which connects with the Valley View trail to form a 1.5-mile loop that was the most popular hiking trail in Big Sur before the blaze. A subsequent fire, landslides, and a long closure of Highway 1 delayed the renovation and long-awaited reopening, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has rejected a request by the state’s Republican congressional delegation to stop paying jobless residents $300 extra a week in federal pandemic relief. The GOP representatives argue the payment, scheduled to run through Sept. 6, is hurting business by deterring unemployed workers from seeking jobs. U.S. Reps. Doug Lamborn, Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert noted in a Friday letter to Polis that Colorado restaurants and numerous other firms are struggling to hire workers. Many states led by Republican governors have ended the supplemental benefit. “We have to stop paying people that should be working to sit at home on the couch,” Boebert said in a statement. “It’s well past time for the government to end COVID bonuses and stop disincentivizing work.” Colorado Politics reports that Polis rejected the proposal, arguing in part that the benefit is helping business. “If Colorado ended these benefits prematurely, it would harm individuals, business owners, and the broader economy,” he wrote. Colorado is offering its own cash incentives for job-seekers. A “Jumpstart” program rewards those getting hired by month’s end with up to $1,600 in incentives. The state labor department reports some 3,800 new claims for regular state benefits were filed last week, the lowest level since the pandemic began.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools that still use Native American nicknames and mascots could take a financial hit if they continue to use those images without written consent from a state- or federally recognized tribe in their region, according to a provision tucked into a massive state budget implementation bill that’s up for a vote Monday. Municipalities face the prospect of losing their allotment of revenue from the Mashantucket Pequot/Mohegan Fund, an account that’s funded with the state’s 25% share of slot machine revenues generated at the two casinos owned and operated by the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribes. The provision was included in the budget bill by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee. “Towns around this state have been told year after year by Connecticut’s Native American tribes that their nicknames and mascots are horribly offensive,” Osten said in a statement. “If certain cities and towns won’t listen to their fellow citizens, then they can certainly do without the tribal money that they are showing such disrespect toward.” It’s estimated that about a dozen schools in Connecticut still use Native American names or images. Some communities have already changed the names of their athletic teams in recent years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Crab cake lovers have something to be, well, crabby about this summer: It might be harder and more expensive than ever to fill up on their favorite shellfish. A bevy of Delaware restaurants have begun limiting crab cake sales and even temporarily suspending “crab nights” because of a shortage of picked crab meat, as well as a sharp increase in prices to meet the growing demand. One reason for the shortage is that businesses are having a hard time finding employees to pick the sweet meat out of the crabs’ sharp shells. This year, just like last summer, restaurants and shops in beach resort towns did not get a stream of annual seasonal foreign workers because of travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic. According to Seafood News.com, crab meat prices have been rising and are at a high because of a lack of inventory, exacerbated by supply limitations in Asia due to COVID-19 and logistic constraints. And, locally, another problem, at least for now, could be there are fewer male crabs in the Chesapeake Bay. A survey from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Virginia Institute of Marine Science estimates the total abundance of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay in 2021 was 282 million crabs, a below-average total for the 32 years of survey results.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The owners of a bar said Monday that they are investigating a weekend incident in which security guards were seen dragging a Black woman down a staircase and throwing her out of the establishment. Nellie’s Sports Bar’s owners also said on Facebook that they have “terminated, with immediate effect, the independent security vendor hired to protect our guests during Pride Week.” Video posted on social media early Sunday shows a bouncer dragging the woman – identified by local media as Keisha Young, 22 – down the stairs as observers scream, “Oh my God!” Some patrons are then seen fighting with the guards. On a video call Monday with her lawyer, Young said: “I feel like, even just separating race from it, no man should ever handle a woman in that way. That should never be OK,” according to Washington’s WRC-TV. A crowd gathered outside Nellie’s Sunday night to protest Young’s treatment. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday: “Obviously, entrepreneurs enforce rules in their restaurants. But they’re not allowed to assault anybody.” Nellie’s owners said the bar “will be closed this week as we evaluate this regrettable situation,” and they vowed to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis visited a South Florida Jewish temple to denounce anti-Semitism and stand with Israel on Monday as the Republican governor cloaked himself in religion while signing a bill into law that would require public schools in his state to set aside at least one minute of silence for children to meditate or pray. His visit to the Shul of Bal Harbour, a Jewish community center in Surfside, had the air of a campaign event. DeSantis seemed to blush when the Rabbi Sholom Lipskar introduced him as a “great governor and future world leader.” It has been speculated that the governor, who is running for reelection next year, might run for president in 2024. DeSantis visited the temple to sign two bills into law. One would expand the role of volunteer ambulance services, while the other makes Florida one of at least 15 states, according to a legislative analysis, that would compel public schools to hold moments of silence. The state had already been among roughly 18 other states that gave schools the option to do so. “The idea that you can just push God out of every institution and be successful – I’m sorry, our Founding Fathers did not believe that,” DeSantis said. The ambulance bill allows some volunteer first responders, including those run by faith-based groups, to use emergency lights and sirens when responding to emergencies. Some Orthodox Jews rely on these volunteer ambulance services to help overcome religious sensitivities that prevent some people form using traditional emergency services.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is establishing a therapeutic foster care program to provide specialized treatment for children with an assortment of behavioral, mental and developmental challenges. Georgia is providing $6.7 million to begin the program that Tom Rawlings, director of the Division of Family and Children Services, called a pilot initiative that he hopes will expand in the future. A similar program existed over a decade ago, and Rawlings and other advocates see its return as a major step toward strengthening welfare services for children with intense treatment needs. “There is this, I believe, very special population of children with very severe emotional issues, often co-occurring autism spectrum and mental health issues, and we as a state really have to develop a more specialized system,” Rawlings said. “And I think that this is a major step toward that.” Therapeutic foster care differs from traditional foster care in several ways. Children placed in a therapeutic care home have individualized care needs that often arise from past trauma. Foster parents in a therapeutic program are trained to handle these challenges and provide around-the-clock care. Children in this program also receive crucial treatment services, usually involving therapy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. is giving Native Hawaiians surplus land as compensation for acres that were meant for homesteading but used instead by the federal government. The land transfer also attempts to help right wrongs against the Indigenous people of Hawaii, officials said Monday. The 80 acres in Ewa Beach formerly used for the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center will eventually provide up to 400 homes while helping fulfill terms of a settlement authorized by Congress in 1995 to compensate Native Hawaiians for 1,500 acres that were set aside for homelands but subsequently acquired and used by the federal government for other purposes, officials said. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s voice choked with emotion while making the announcement Monday. “Yes, it’s a happy day, but it’s also a sad day because we remember the tragedy that befell the Native Hawaiians throughout their tumultuous history,” said Haaland, the first Native American woman to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency. “Since that time, our country has learned a great deal. And now we are in an era where we recognize the importance of healing the generational traumas that caused pain and heartache.” The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by allowing them to use land to live on, with a 99-year lease for $1 a year.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four housing organizations in the state are getting coronavirus relief funding to help cover the cost of emergency housing vouchers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $2.4 million total to the Housing Authority of the City of Pocatello, the Boise City Housing Authority, the Southwestern Idaho Cooperative Housing Authority, and the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, the Idaho Press reports. The money will cover 217 vouchers and related administrative costs, according to a prepared statement from HUD, and is part of $1 billion being awarded to housing organizations nationwide. As of January 2020, Idaho had about 2,300 people “experiencing homelessness on any given day,” according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Addressing our nation’s homelessness crisis is a top priority for HUD,” HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. Deanna Watson, the executive director of the Boise City/Ada County Housing Authority, said increases in rent levels have a lot of people getting priced out of the market. The vouchers will work by subsidizing rents in a place with fair market rents, Watson said. In addition, there’s assistance in some of the fees that come with finding houses, security deposits and case management.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A cave system closed more than a decade ago is reopening to the public. The state Department of Natural Resources announced last week that Illinois Caverns in Monroe County would reopen Wednesday. Officials closed the southern Illinois cave in 2010 as a precaution for bats who live there due to the spread of a fatal disease called white-nose syndrome. WNS is named after the white fungus found on the muzzle, ears and wings of infected bats. White-nose syndrome cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, but officials feared humans exploring caves could spread it from one location to another, endangering more bats. Joe Kath, the department’s Endangered Species Program manager, said the disease’s prevalence in bats hibernating within Illinois Caverns has been relatively low since the closure compared to other locations in the state. “The caverns – one of the state’s scenic wonders – attracted visitors from across the state, which is why the decision was made to close them,” Kath said. “Our biologists felt that proactively closing Illinois Caverns, and other state-managed caves across the state, was the best option to protect the state’s bat population from (white-nose syndrome).” Illinois Caverns will be open Wednesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and seasonally from April through October.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two legal organizations are suing the state to prevent Gov. Eric Holcomb from pulling out of a federal unemployment program that’s paying benefits to hundreds of thousands of residents. Macey Swanson Hicks & Sauer law firm and Indiana Legal Services, an organization that provides legal assistance to low-income Hoosiers, filed a joint civil lawsuit in Marion County Superior Court, claiming the end of the benefits would hurt their clients and people across the state. The organizations argued that Indiana law requires the state to procure federal insurance benefits to its citizens. “These benefits have provided life-sustaining and crucial assistance to many Hoosiers during the pandemic,” Jon Laramore, executive director of Indiana Legal Services, said in a statement. “The legislature passed a law creating a right to these benefits, and we’re asking Governor Holcomb to follow the law.” The Republican governor announced last month he was ending the federal benefits June 19 because many businesses in the service industry are struggling to fill jobs. While economists are skeptical that unemployment benefits are the reason people aren’t returning to low-wage jobs, Holcomb is banking on the benefits cut to drive more people back to work.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials at the city’s public water system on Monday asked customers to begin using water wisely and cut lawn irrigation by 25% as water usage reached new highs and drought conditions slowed the flow of rivers. The combination of high demand and low water flow resulted in Des Moines Water Works demand reaching 90% of capacity Friday. The utility that serves 500,000 customers in central Iowa said it delivered nearly 90 million gallons of water that day. “We have taken proactive steps to ensure we have enough water for customers, but the Raccoon River is low enough that you can walk across it. Now, we are asking our customers to do their part and use water wisely,” CEO Ted Corrigan said. The flow rate in the Raccoon River, which is a major water source for the DMWW, is down to less than 300 cubic feet per second compared the median flow of 4,000 cubic feet per second. The average high temperature for Des Moines for the first 13 days of June was 88, significantly above the normal of 79.9, according to the National Weather Service. The city has had 0.02 inches of rain this month. The average is 5.26 inches. In Iowa, 46% of the state is classified as in moderate drought, up from 29% the week before, said the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is going to struggle to vaccinate more residents, a top aide to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said, and thousands of families will lose extra food aid because top Republican legislators on Tuesday ended a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic. Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff, said the state will no longer be able to use its National Guard to distribute vaccines or personal protective equipment, and addressing COVID-19 is “just going to be more difficult.” Senate President Ty Masterson announced the cancellation of a meeting of eight leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature set for Tuesday afternoon. A law enacted in late March required the legislative leaders to sign off on an extension, and Masterson’s announcement meant the state of emergency was to expire at the end of Tuesday after being in place since March 2020. Kelly accused Republicans of “political obstruction.” She told reporters last week that she wanted the state of emergency to continue at least through August. “A state disaster response has never been, and should not be, political,” Kelly said in a statement. But “it is time for Kansas to return to normal,” Masterson, R-Andover, said in a joint statement with two other GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Larry Alley, of Winfield, and Vice President Rick Wilborn, of McPherson.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State residents now have the option of getting their driver’s license renewed online. The service launched Monday, with Kentucky Transportation Secretary Jim Gray saying it would lead to “greater efficiency, greater security and more choices” for drivers. Online renewal is available for those with standard-issue or Real ID licenses that will expire within six months or have been expired for less than a year, officials said. Renewals must also maintain the same card version as well as the same name and address as their current license. Applications for a replacement license or a license with a name or address change must still be made in person. Online renewal is among the options available due to the phased transfer of licensing services to the Transportation Cabinet’s regional offices from local offices of the circuit court clerks, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: People caught with small amounts of recreational marijuana will soon face a misdemeanor fine and no possibility of jail time, under a bill that Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday he has signed into law. The measure sponsored by state Rep. Cedric Glover, D-Shreveport, won narrow, bipartisan support in the legislative session that ended Thursday. With the Democratic governor’s signature, the new law will take effect Aug. 1. Glover’s bill makes possession of up to 14 grams of marijuana – a half-ounce – a misdemeanor crime carrying a fine up to $100 with no possibility of jail time, even for repeat offenses. “This is not a decision I took lightly,” Edwards said in his statement announcing the bill signing. He described the legislation as another step in Louisiana’s “criminal justice reform efforts.” “In addition to carefully reviewing the bill, I also believe deeply that the state of Louisiana should no longer incarcerate people for minor legal infractions, especially those that are legal in many states, that can ruin lives and destroy families, as well as cost taxpayers greatly,” Edwards said. Several municipalities around Louisiana already had switched to fines rather than arrests for possession of small amounts of recreational cannabis, and the state has a legal medical marijuana program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state House voted Monday to eliminate Maine’s secretive “fusion center” created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure data is shared among law enforcement agencies. The 88-54 vote followed a whistleblower lawsuit and legislative scrutiny of the center, which was accused of gathering and storing intelligence on gun buyers, power line protesters, and employees of a camp for Israeli and Arab teens. Further votes would be necessary to close the center, which is an arm of the Maine State Police. The proposal provoked fierce debate – and rare bipartisan support – with lawmakers invoking George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and even making comparisons to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. Another lawmaker countered by suggesting the bill was a veiled attempt to defund the police. Rep. Jeffrey Evangelos, an independent from Friendship, said the goal of sharing information about foreign-based terrorism was admirable but said there was “mission creep” beyond the center’s original purpose. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlotte Warren, D-Hallowell, said the operator of the fusion center couldn’t demonstrate that it was an effective use of taxpayer dollars or that it offered something new that other law enforcement agencies didn’t already provide.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency will end July1, more than 15 months after the deadly coronavirus made its first appearance in the state in March 2020. All remaining health restrictions will end on that date, Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday, including mask mandates. “The battle’s not over,” Hogan said. “We’re transitioning from a state of emergency to an ongoing operation.” That operation will include continuing to vaccinate thousands of Marylanders who still need COVID-19 shots and caring for the shrinking number of people sickened by the virus. Over the course of the pandemic, Maryland has seen more than 460,000 cases of COVID-19. Nearly 9,500 people have died, many of them elderly and vulnerable. Hogan said Tuesday that Maryland’s health metrics have improved significantly since the worst peak of the pandemic in the winter. “We have finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel,” Hogan said. There will be a 45-day grace period after July 1 to allow Marylanders to adjust to the end of emergency regulations, Hogan said. That includes an extra 45 days to renew driver’s licenses and an extension to the state’s eviction moratorium. Ending the state of emergency does not affect Maryland’s access to federal funds, Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is giving away five $1 million cash prizes and five $300,000 college scholarships to residents who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. The aim of the so-called VaxMillions Giveaway, modeled after a similar program in Ohio, is to drive up the state’s vaccination rate, already one of the best in the nation, he said. About 4 million Bay Staters are already fully vaccinated, according to the Department of Public Health. “So if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines and thinking about getting vaccinated but for whatever reason haven’t, here’s another reason for you to come forward, protect yourself, your friends, your co-workers and your neighbors by getting vaccinated here in the commonweath,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. All legal residents who have been vaccinated in the state are eligible to register for the lottery prizes by going to mass.gov/VaxMillions starting July 1. Residents ages 18 and older are eligible for the $1 million prizes, while residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for the scholarships, which are in the form of grants via a 529 College Savings Plan managed by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. The state will hold weekly drawings for five weeks starting July 26.\n\nMichigan\n\nAllendale Township: Community leaders in western Michigan have voted to keep a statue of Confederate and Union Civil War soldiers with a Black child kneeling between them. The Allendale Township board voted 5-2 on Monday, despite a recommendation from a group that the statue be replaced by one with Union soldiers who are Black, Native American and white. “It’s been made very clear to me that the majority of our residents wish for the Civil War statue to remain in the garden of honor,” said Jody Hansen, township clerk and board member. Dozens of people attended the meeting, which was held outdoors at a park bandshell, 15 miles west of Grand Rapids. “What better lesson can we teach our children than by being able to say, ‘We had this thing. We thought it was OK. We have since learned that we were wrong,’ ” said area resident Cathy Seaver, who wants the statue removed. Trustee Barb VanderVeen, who opposed keeping the statue, asked if the child, which represents a slave, could at least be removed. Trustee Candy Kraker said the artist indicated that removing it would damage the structural integrity.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A group representing landlords announced a lawsuit Tuesday to force an end to the eviction moratorium imposed by Gov. Tim Walz, saying his order makes it all but impossible for property owners to remove disruptive tenants. The Minnesota Multi Housing Association said the governor’s executive order, which was issued in the early days of the pandemic, has become unworkable as it was originally written and is no longer needed. “Over the past year it has become clear that property owners are expected to wait until there is evidence that a person has become so dangerous that other residents have to call the police or move out, or that the rental unit is completely destroyed,” according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court Monday. The association’s CEO, Cecil Smith, told reporters at the Capitol that the lawsuit had been in the works long before legislative leaders agreed Monday to a 15-week “off-ramp” for ending the moratorium. The negotiators said the bipartisan agreement offers strong protections for renters and clear timelines for Minnesotans who owe back rent to secure rental assistance, which is paid directly to landlords. Landlords would be required to send notices to tenants who are behind on their rent 15 days prior to eviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nWater Valley: A former state lawmaker was found shot to death over the weekend in a rural area outside the burned home where her sister-in-law was found dead after Christmas. Ashley Henley, 40, was a Republican who served in the state House from January 2016 to January 2020 from a district in DeSoto County. The North Mississippi Herald was first to report that Henley’s body was found Sunday night in rural Yalobusha County, about 70 miles south of DeSoto County. Her body was outside the home where the body of her sister-in-law Kristina Michelle Jones was found Dec. 26. The Herald published a photo of a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase, “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that the time of Henley’s death had not yet been determined. Stark told WMC-TV that Henley had been mowing grass at the home before she was killed. Henley was a teacher before she was elected to the state House, and she often took her young son to the state Capitol during legislative sessions. She sought a second term in November 2019 and lost by 14 votes to a Democrat. Henley challenged the outcome, saying she believed she had found voting irregularities. A committee in the GOP-controlled House held a hearing and denied Henley’s petition.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson enacted a new law Tuesday limiting the duration of local public health restrictions and barring governments from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public facilities and transportation. The law took effect immediately upon Parson’s signature, but it may have little immediate effect because most local officials already lifted their coronavirus restrictions on businesses and public gatherings and have not been checking people’s vaccination status. Parson, a Republican, said the law still is important for the future. “Then next time we do get in a crisis, we’re going to have a little bit more safeguards for the general public to make sure they have more transparency and more of a voice in the process,” he said. When under a statewide emergency declaration, the new law limits local orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by a majority vote of the local governing body such as a city council. If there is no state emergency declaration, then local orders closing entire classifications of entities or activities could last for only 21 days, unless extended by a two-thirds vote of the local governing body.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Public review has begun for a proposal to boost radio and cellphone service in Glacier National Park, park officials said. The deadline to comment is July 11. The proposal calls for upgrades to communications from the National Park Service, which uses outdated technology or can’t reach remote areas of the park, the Missoulian reports. Currently, cellphone service is only available in the western part of the park at Apgar and the eastern part of the park because of commercial cell towers outside the park borders. “While recognizing that national parks provide disconnected space for many visitors, the plan also proposes a strategy for commercial cellular and/or internet access for public and NPS use in certain developed areas,” such as Many Glacier, Rising Sun, Two Medicine and Lake McDonald Lodge, park spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The proposal would prohibit large-scale cell towers and commercial telecommunications gear in the backcountry, despite visitors and employees alike relying more on internet access. Signal strength would be limited as much as possible to the four developed areas mentioned in the proposal, Kerzman said, although some spillover might be unpreventable.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state is approaching having 70% of its adult population vaccinated against COVID-19, but the pace of distribution of the shots continues to slow. The state may be close to President Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% or more of all adults with at least one dose of the vaccine by July 4. About 63% of Nebraskans 18 and older had received at least one shot as of Friday, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate ranks 24th among all the states. Nebraska has 57% of its adults fully vaccinated. Vermont leads the nation with 84% of its adults having received at least one shot, and 14 states have exceeded Biden’s goal. The CDC said roughly 31,000 shots were distributed in Nebraska last week, which was down from 37,000 the week before and well below the mid-April peak of 150,000 in a week. The number of new virus cases reported in the state continues to fall. Nebraska reported 234 new cases last week, down from 254 the week before and 378 two weeks ago. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 44.86 new cases per day May 30 to 28.43 new cases per day Sunday. Nebraska has reported 223,888 virus cases and 2,258 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Advocates are building momentum toward setting aside a wide desert area rich with biological diversity and Native American cultural significance for permanent environmental protection. The southern Nevada site would be called Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and encompass a Spanish Colonial Revival house that once belonged to 1920s-era Hollywood actors Clara Bow and Rex Bell on their historic Walking Box Ranch. The rugged and dry landscape is dotted with Joshua trees between mountain ranges west of Searchlight. At more than 594 square miles, it covers an area larger than San Francisco Bay. “There are threats to the sort of peace and the environment that we’re in right now,” Gabriel di Chiara, a Nevada Conservation League organizer, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “And we believe establishing this monument will preserve this land and this way of life for future generations, and it’s vitally important.” Conservation advocates providing a tour of the 5,000-square-foot homesite June 9 said they saw hope in President Joe Biden’s administration, a federal conservation plan that aims to protect 30% of American lands and water by 2030, and the appointment of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland as the first Native American head of a presidential Cabinet post.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As the number of COVID-19 cases has fallen and restrictions have been dropped in the state, drug overdoses are on the rise in some cities. Suspected overdoses in Manchester and Nashua rose by 26% in May, according to American Medical Response. The 72 suspected overdoses was the most in a single month since June 2019, WMUR-TV reports. Overdoses decreased during the pandemic since more people were inside, said AMR Regional Director Chris Stawasz. “It gives us concern that in the summer months, which we typically see as higher overdose months, we’re going to be back probably at levels we have not seen in several years,” he said. More people now have access to the overdose reversal drug Narcan, officials said. There was record use of Narcan in May in Manchester.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Fifteen months after they were shuttered at the height of the pandemic, adult day care centers will be allowed to reopen due to a sharp decline in COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and cases, state officials said Monday. The centers, which provide activities for those suffering from dementia, were closed to protect the elderly March 20, 2020, when there were only 890 cases and 11 confirmed COVID deaths in the state. Since then, New Jersey has tallied more than 890,000 cases and 26,000 COVID-19 deaths, the vast majority of which have been among seniors. The adult centers are some of the few facilities that are still closed due to COVID-19, while most other venues have been reopened for more than a year, and mask-wearing and social distancing have been relaxed. Safety guidance on how to return to operations such as requiring screenings for staff was to be sent out to the centers Monday, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Among the procedures: Staff must wear masks regardless of vaccination status. Participants can engage in close group activities if everyone is vaccinated. An isolation room is needed for a sick participant. And windows and doors should remain open to promote better ventilation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is urging cities and counties to consider banning the sale of fireworks ahead of the July Fourth holiday. She issued an executive order Monday, pointing to the drought that has blanketed much of the state and the fire restrictions that already are in place across New Mexico’s five national forests. While state statutes prevent the governor from imposing a statewide ban, the governor’s office is encouraging municipalities to take action to limit fire danger by adopting fireworks restrictions over the coming weeks. Rio Rancho and Farmington have warned residents that only permissible fireworks will be allowed – such as cone fountains, crackling devices and sparklers – and only in paved or otherwise barren areas. Dona Ana County recently approved restrictions that will span the holiday. “We want to prevent fires in the dangerous conditions we are experiencing,” County Fire Chief Shannon Cherry said, referring to the dry and windy weather. Farmington’s proclamation also will remain in effect for 30 days, but officials said the City Council may extend it if extreme conditions continue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dozens of Holocaust survivors clapped, sang and danced Monday at a concert held in their honor in Brooklyn in the first large gathering for New York-area survivors after months of isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. The concert by popular Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey was organized by the Nachas Health and Family Network and other groups that help the more than 35,000 Holocaust survivors estimated to live in the New York City metropolitan area. “It’s extremely good for the soul, for the heart, to see people coming out once again and socializing,” said Dolly Rabinowitz, who sat in the front row of the Yeshivah of Flatbush auditorium joined by other Holocaust survivors and students of the Modern Orthodox Jewish school. The survivors, most now in their 80s and 90s, suffered unspeakable horrors in concentration camps. In the past year, many remained isolated at home because they were at a high risk from the fast-spreading virus. “To be out once again is like reviving ourselves. To sit among our children and grandchildren is heartwarming,” said Rabinowitz, who lived through Auschwitz and the Death March. Some held hands and choked back tears when they heard an instrumental version of “Ani Ma’amin,” sung by many Jews herded into cattle cars on their way to concentration camps.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Constitution Party of North Carolina and North Carolina Green Party have failed to garner enough signatures to remain official political parties in the state for now, an election official said Monday. The State Board of Elections determined earlier this year that the two small parties had fallen short of candidate support thresholds from last November. But the board said the parties would be recognized again to field candidates starting later this year if each collected about 13,900 signatures of registered voters by Saturday. Neither party reached that goal, board spokesman Noah Grant wrote in an email. That means their parties’ registrants – totaling 9,600 between them – will now be re-designated as unaffiliated voters. The confirmed signatures so far – over 2,800 for the Constitution Party and fewer than 10 for the Green Party – will roll over into petitions to field candidates in the November 2022 election, Grant said. The groups would need to be meet the thresholds by next June 1 to qualify. For now, the state will recognize just three official political parties: Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2021 fell nearly 10% over the same period the previous year. Taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.1 billion, a 9.9% decrease over the three-month span in 2020. Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger said the drop was due to the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the state’s economy. Despite the decline statewide, Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot all reported increases, led by Fargo at 17.6%. Ten of the 15 major industry sectors reported declines over the year. The mining and oil extraction sector decreased by $438 million, or about 59%. The wholesale trade sector decreased by $250 million, a 23.5% drop. North Dakota’s taxable sales and purchases are a key indicator of economic activity in the state. They also are used to forecast state budgets.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans receiving food stamps would have to undergo a new “asset test” that measures total worth, including the value of cars owned by anyone in a household, under a provision in the Senate’s version of the state’s upcoming two-year budget. The goal of the test is to be sure needy recipients of SNAP benefits get what they deserve, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. “There are a lot of folks who can afford to pay for a variety of things who are still receiving these benefits,” Huffman said this month. The measure incorporates elements of stand-alone legislation introduced earlier this year in the GOP-controlled Senate. Dozens of people representing food banks, legal aid groups and health care advocacy groups have testified against it. Opponents of that bill, pending in the Senate Government Oversight and Reform Committee, say it comes at the worst possible time, as emergency federal benefits enacted during the coronavirus pandemic expire. Those include maximum allotments for food stamp recipients, a $300 weekly unemployment supplement, and a moratorium on evictions. “It will force low-income Ohioans to choose between having food and owning a car to get to work or saving money to prepare for an emergency,” said Kelsey Bergfeld, director of Columbus-based Advocates for Ohio’s Future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: “Tiger King” Joe Exotic is selling items seen on the hit Netflix series that elevated the big cat handler into a household name. The auction will also include NFT versions – digital “non-fungible tokens” – of those items and artwork. Exotic, real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, will be selling 3D renderings of cult collectibles sold alongside real-life tangible items seen on the show, as well as digital artworks for fans. Items include Exotic’s Smith & Wesson revolver, a fringed leather jacket and images autographed from prison. Online auction house Mintable will present the auction Friday at officialtigerkingnft.com. Also up for bid are the Tiger King’s black leather jacket and pants set, a bikini worn by adult film actress Rachel Starr, digital trading cards and artwork, and audio recordings of Exotic made from federal prison, where he’s serving a 22-year sentence for hiring someone to murder nemesis Carol Baskin. He was already somewhat of a celebrity in Oklahoma before Netflix launched the “Tiger King” series last year. For years, he ran an exotic animal park near Wynnewood, offering guests an up-close experience with big cats like his namesake tigers. He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party’s nomination for governor in 2018, two years after campaigning for president.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 4 in 10 Oregonians strongly or somewhat agree with statements that reflect core arguments of white nationalist and other far-right groups, according to a new statewide survey. DHM Research and the Oregon Values and Beliefs Center, both independent nonpartisan organizations, surveyed 603 Oregon residents in a 15-minute online questionnaire Jan. 8-13. They estimate the margin of error is between 2.4% and 4.0%. To recruit respondents, DHM used a professionally maintained panel. It also set demographic quotas and weighted data to ensure a representative sample. Survey results indicated that, compared to a DHM Research panel in 2018, fewer Oregonians believed in protecting and preserving the country’s multicultural heritage. More agreed America “must protect and preserve its white European heritage.” It’s a “disturbing” revelation, said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at Western States Center, the progressive nonprofit organization that commissioned the research. She said the 4 in 10 represent a growing population in the state that is vulnerable to messages commonly used by white nationalists like the ones posed in the survey, including the “white heritage” idea and that “white people in America face discrimination and unfair treatment on the basis of their race.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A ban on employers mandating vaccines for their workers inched ahead in the state House on Tuesday with a committee vote supported by all Republicans and opposed by every Democrat. The main sponsor, Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, called it “a very simple question of workers’ rights.” Diamond has been a fervent opponent of coronavirus mitigation policies and has been publicly skeptical of mask-wearing and vaccines. Labor and Industry Committee Chairman Jim Cox, R-Berks, said lawmakers were responding to increasing reports that employers are requiring COVID-19 vaccines, forcing some workers to choose between the jab or losing a job. An amendment by Cox took out a provision in Diamond’s bill that would have ended employer-mandated tests for marijuana. Diamond said after the meeting that the marijuana testing language lacked support. The bill would let workers or prospective workers avoid workplace-mandated vaccinations by putting into writing that their doctor has concerns it might harm their health; that they have religious or “strong moral or ethical” convictions against a vaccine; that they already contracted COVID-19; or that they are concerned because tge vaccines have not been fully approved by federal regulators.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State officials are proposing to build a new laboratory to replace the one run by the Health Department, which is the only Level 3 biosafety facility in the state. Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott is advocating for spending $82 million to replace the State Health Lab that she said had limited capacity to expand testing needed during the coronavirus pandemic because the building’s systems are outdated. “When it came to testing, for example, where we were leaders, we ultimately were inhibited by our ability to expand just because of the confines of the building and the electrical supply for the building,” Alexander-Scott said. “With the next pandemic, we are going to need the ability to expand and shift and streamline.” The medical examiner’s office, state crime lab and environmental testing labs are also located in the same building as the State Health Lab in downtown Providence across from the state Capitol. Gov. Dan McKee included the allocation for the new lab in the proposed budget. If the Legislature approves the spending, it would come from the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief that the state is getting. The new fiscal year starts July 1, and a final budget bill is expected this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: It may just be loose change, but parking meters are helping to show how tourism is booming along the state’s most popular beach after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted. Myrtle Beach collected as much in parking fees in May as it does in a typical June, Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Office Executive Director Brian Schmitt told The Post and Courier of Charleston. “2021 has just been nuts,” Schmitt said. “In March, we did April numbers. In April, we did May numbers. … If that trend continues, then we hit June with July numbers – which July is typically our best month, our $360,000 month – we expect to maybe see that continue.” The city no longer just collects coins from meters. There are parking lot terminals that take debit and credit cards and a mobile app called ParkMobile that allows drivers to stop their cars and pay with a click of a smartphone, officials said. More traditional ways of measuring tourism are also up in Myrtle Beach. The Chamber of Commerce said hotel occupancy rates are up this summer compared to 2019. The officials don’t use 2020 numbers to compare because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge on Monday criminally charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court and obstructing justice after a dispute with a marshal who refused to disclose her COVID-19 vaccination status and removed prisoners from a courthouse. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow May 10, after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19, the Aberdeen American News reports. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann gave the U.S. Attorney’s Office until Friday to decide whether to charge the marshals, including Daniel Mosteller, the head of the agency in South Dakota, and Stephen Houghtaling, the state’s chief deputy. Kornmann said he was determined to find another prosecutor if the U.S. attorney declined to prosecute the case. Kornmann moved in March to require vaccinations for courthouse employees, but Mosteller told the judge the Marshals Service was not requiring employees to get vaccinated and would not provide their vaccination status to the court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal courts released 18% of Tennessee prisoners who requested compassionate release in 2020, a new report from the federal Sentencing Commission shows. At the height of COVID-19 last year, thousands of motions asking for reduced sentences were filed in courts across the nation, according to the commission. Most of those were filed by the defendants themselves. Combined, 336 federal defendants in Tennessee districts filed motions for compassionate release. The courts released 61 of them. The Sentencing Commission tracks federal sentencing trends and policy, regularly releasing reports on that data. The June 10 report focuses only on compassionate release cases. Nationally, a total of 2,549 defendants were compassionately released, their sentences ending, according to the commission. That number is 21% of those who tried. “Compassionate release” is a broad term, usually related to sentencing laws that allow the court to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to warrant an early release. At least 6,654 people in Tennessee Department of Corrections custody had contracted COVID-19 as of last week, and 42 of them are believed to have died from the disease.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: On the cusp of summer, the electric power grid manager for most of the state on Monday issued its second conservation alert since the deadly February blackout, calling on users to dial back energy consumption through Friday to avert an emergency. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said many forced generation outages and record June demand have squeezed the power supply. It appealed to users to set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees and avoid using large electric appliances until demand decreased late in the day. ERCOT predicted a peak demand load on its system of 73,000 megawatts, far above the June record of 69,123 megawatts set between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. June 27, 2018. However, as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, 12,178 megawatts of the grid’s 86,862 megawatts of generating capacity were offline, ERCOT said, leaving a razor-thin margin of reserve capacity of about 2,000 megawatts. “We will be conducting a thorough analysis with generation owners to determine why so many units are out of service,” Woody Rickerson, ERCOT vice president of grid planning and operations, said in a statement. “This is unusual for this early in the summer season.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Transportation officials have reported nearly twice as many people died in alcohol-involved crashes on the state’s roads last year compared to the year before, despite less commuter traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Transportation said there were 61 fatal crashes involving alcohol last year compared to the 32 crashes in 2019, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Department officials said there was also an 11% increase in traffic fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2020, which includes fatal alcohol-involved crashes. Nationally, there was a 7% increase in traffic fatalities over the past year and a 9% increase in alcohol-involved fatalities, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Robert Miles, director of traffic and safety for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it’s too soon to know why fatal crashes increased. He said the pattern has surprised everyone, including traffic experts. “I think … most people thought if there is less traffic on the street there will be fewer fatalities; there will be fewer crashes,” he said. “We saw fewer crashes, but we saw more fatal crashes.” Miles said it is possible people began taking more risks while driving because of extra road space created by reduced traffic. But he also said not every type of fatal crash increased in the past year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Now that the state of emergency imposed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in Vermont is ending, meetings of public bodies must be held in person, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said. During the pandemic, public boards were authorized to hold those meetings remotely. Condos said boards can still allow people to attend remotely, but a physical meeting location must be provided, and those bodies must physically post notices of the meetings. “Vermont’s public servants have made it clear that our government can still operate and make critical decisions during a public health emergency without sacrificing the right of Vermonters to know how their government is making those decisions and their right to participate in the process,” Condos said in a statement Monday. “As we transition towards our shared ‘new normal,’ it is vital that we use the many successes, best practices, and lessons learned from the last 15 months to improve how we, as trusted public officials, best serve the public.” On Monday, after the state vaccinated just over 80% of the eligible population, Gov. Phil Scott lifted all COVID-19 restrictions. The state of emergency that allowed the remote meetings expired at midnight Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A dental student at Virginia Commonwealth University has been awarded $10,000 by her school to develop a prototype for her invention to help those wearing braces floss between their teeth. Student Christina Gordon first developed her idea for the Proxy-Flosser when she was 10 years old and looking for a better way to complete the tedious task. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports she put something together akin to a floss pick and didn’t think much else about it until she enrolled in dental school. She said she was shocked to learn that a better product still hadn’t been invented, and she began making inquiries about whether her Proxy-Flosser was marketable. She won $10,000 from VCU’s Innovation Gateway, which helps faculty and students commercialize their innovations. Because her idea has not been patented, she is not publicly disclosing the details of her invention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a law that will require meal-delivery apps to sign agreements with restaurants instead of listing restaurants on the apps and taking orders without permission. Council President M. Lorena Gonzalez, who sponsored the law, said it will protect restaurants, simplify work for delivery-app drivers and give customers more reliable service, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-0 on Monday. Mayor Jenny Durkan hadn’t reviewed the law yet to determine whether she’ll sign it or let it become law without her signature, her office said. Council staff noted the law could result in some restaurants paying delivery fees they’re not paying now, possibly less work for drivers and fewer options for customers. Gonzalez said restaurant industry groups such as Seattle Restaurant Alliance backed the measure, and labor groups and delivery apps were consulted. Delivery apps Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats didn’t immediately comment. Brianna Megid, a spokesperson for DoorDash, said restaurants should have the power to make choices affecting their businesses. DoorDash removes restaurants, when requested, she said. Under the status quo, delivery apps can use online menus and other information to list restaurants without permission. Restaurants may not even know they’re listed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hundreds of demonstrators outraged with Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to a sweeping overhaul of U.S. election law marched through the capital city Monday evening. The Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, denounced the influential moderate Democratic senator and called for a diverse coalition of working people to apply pressure on Manchin, who recently opposed a $15 minimum wage and the price tag of President Joe Biden’s initial $2 trillion infrastructure plan. “West Virginia needs a real senator,” Barber told the crowd at a Charleston park. Then they marched a mile to Manchin’s office. Unable to meet with the senator – an aide told Barber he was in Washington – leaders of the demonstration affixed a poster-sized protest letter to the front doors of the office building. Rallygoers took turns signing their names on it. When Manchin’s aides offered comment cards to collect protestors’ grievances, Barber waved them away: “We don’t want to talk to the staff.” The protest was spurred by Manchin’s decision to oppose a landmark reform of U.S. election law, a proposal known as For the People Act. Manchin said last week that passing reform on a party-line vote risked further stoking partisan divides.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The superintendents of the state’s five largest school districts told members of the Legislature on Tuesday that they’re “dismayed” that $2.3 billion in federal aid is at risk because of low funding for K-12 schools. Superintendents of the Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay school districts urged lawmakers in a letter to set aside partisan differences and do what’s best for schools. The state budget being written by the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee does not include enough funding for K-12 schools to ensure that Wisconsin would be able to keep $2.3 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they will ensure the funding wouldn’t be lost. The budget committee plans to complete its work this week. As it stands, the new budget would include $128 million more in state funding for K-12 schools than the current one, which is about one-tenth of what Democratic Gov. Tony Evers requested. Evers and Democrats have urged lawmakers to spend more on K-12 schools, especially in light of rosier projections showing the state will collect $4.4 billion more in taxes than originally expected.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A recycled wooden sculpture of an enormous troll now lounges in Rendezvous Park. It’s the brainchild of Copenhagen artist Thomas Dambo, who has built trolls all over the world. Their whimsical construction beckons spectators to clamber aboard and, in the case of R Park, serves as a bridge to ferry the fun from the park to a nearby miniature island, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Dambo named the Jackson Hole troll “Mama Mimi,” for her motherly guidance – plus, he said, Mimi is a “good, strong” Scandinavian name. “I’m super happy with it,” the artist said of his 80th piece. Mimi is one of the few female trolls in Dambo’s small army, and apart from one tucked in a fjord, she’s the first to interact so closely with water. Mimi’s face and feet were assembled at the artist’s Denmark workshop, but everything else was mapped out and assembled on site. Her hair is made entirely of driftwood roots found washed up on the banks of the Snake River. Rather than buying lumber that’s been shipped across the country, he used leftover pallets from Osprey Beverages, saving them from the dumpster. Mimi’s signature stone necklace was sourced from the river and a team member who offered up an old, oversized rope as a band. Set back a quarter-mile or so from the bridge, Mimi won’t be collecting any toll money from travelers, but she did cost a pretty penny: roughly $50,000 raised by an army of #Trollbackers, plus another $50,000 from private donors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}]}

Analysts said the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, exceeding its last ICBM launch in November 2017.\n\nJapan’s Vice Defense Minister Makoto Oniki told reporters Thursday the missile’s altitude would suggest it is a “new type of ICBM,” a potential sign North Korea is closer to developing weapons capable of targeting the United States.\n\nNorth Korean state media later appeared to confirm Oniki’s assessment, announcing the launch of a Hwasong-17 missile, the country’s newest known ICBM variant.\n\nThe US joined allies South Korea and Japan in strongly condemning the launch Thursday and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is currently in Belgium, where he is attending a G7 summit alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The gathering is part of a series of meetings, including an extraordinary NATO summit, as Western leaders seek to align their responses to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. A European Council meeting will also take place Thursday.\n\nAccording to analysts, the recent spate of North Korean missile tests suggest the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, is attempting show an increasingly turbulent world that Pyongyang remains a player in the struggle for power and influence.\n\n“North Korea refuses to be ignored and may be trying to take advantage of global preoccupation with the war in Ukraine to force a fait accompli on its status as a nuclear weapons state,” Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told CNN.\n\n“North Korea is nowhere near initiating aggression on the scale of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Pyongyang’s ambitions likewise exceed self-defense as it wants to overturn the postwar security order in Asia, added Easley.\n\nThursday’s test also comes just two weeks after South Korea elected a new conservative President, Yoon Suk Yeol, who is expected to take a harder line against North Korea than outgoing office holder President Moon Jae-in.\n\nIn response to Thursday’s suspected ICBM test, South Korea’s military launched several warning missiles for the first time since 2017, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a text sent to reporters.\n\n“Our military is monitoring North Korean military’s movements and have confirmed that we have the capability and posture to accurately strike the origin location of the missile launch and command and support facilities any time North Korea launches a missile,” the JCS said.\n\nProvocative act\n\nAnalysts said North Korea appeared to have conducted a so-called lofted missile test Thursday. “This is a tactic often employed by them to test longer range systems without more provocatively overflying another country,” said Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\nHe said the preliminary data of Thursday’s test indicate it could be a Hwasong-17, a much larger ICBM than the Hwasong-15 tested in 2017.\n\nKim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said data indicates Thursday’s missile could have a maximum range of about 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) – theoretically putting it within reach of the continental United States, depending on the weight of the warhead it would carry – and about 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) further than the Hwasong-15.\n\nDespite the potentially extended range, Kim said Pyongyang has still yet to demonstrate its ability to master the technology required to enable a warhead to successfully re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere into the final stages of flight.\n\nUS response\n\nPyongyang’s other most recent launches, on February 26 and March 4, were likely intended to test a new ICBM system, the US Defense Department said earlier this month.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command announced earlier this month that the US is intensifying “intelligence, readiness and surveillance collection activities” related to North Korea following the recent missile launches.\n\nThe move is a signal from the Biden administration that it needs to strengthen its military posture to ensure the US and allies in the region like South Korea and Japan are protected against North Korea’s missile tests.\n\nThe command said they have “ordered intensified Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance collection activities in the Yellow Sea, as well as enhanced readiness among our ballistic missile defense forces in the region.”\n\nEarlier this month, the US military staged exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula to show its readiness in the wake of North Korean activity, including simulating ballistic missile defense systems.\n\nThe US Army’s 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to a remote location, “occupying its wartime defensive position, emplacing the Patriot missile system, and executing air and missile defense operations under a simulated combat scenario,” US Forces Korea said in a press release.\n\nAnd at sea, F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets flying off the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln along with US Air Force assets based in the region put on a show of force in the Yellow Sea off the western coast of South Korea, according to a statement from the US Navy’s 7th Fleet in Japan.\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify the location of missile.", "authors": ["Yoonjung Seo Gawon Bae Emiko Jozuka Brad Lendon", "Yoonjung Seo", "Gawon Bae", "Emiko Jozuka", "Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/asia/north-korea-missile-japan-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea fired a missile over Japan for the first time in five years ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nNorth Korea fired a ballistic missile without warning over Japan on Tuesday for the first time in five years, a highly provocative and reckless act that marks a significant escalation in its weapons testing program.\n\nThe missile traveled over northern Japan early in the morning, and is believed to have landed in the Pacific Ocean. The last time North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan was in 2017.\n\nThis marks North Korea’s 23rd missile launch this year, including the most ballistic missiles fired in a single year since leader Kim Jong Un took power in 2012. By comparison, Pyongyang conducted four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about North Korea’s missile tests.\n\nWhat do we know about the missile?\n\nTuesday’s missile flew a distance of about 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles), with an altitude of some 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and a top speed reaching Mach 17 – meaning 17 times the speed of sound, according to Japanese officials.\n\nBy way of comparison, the US island territory of Guam is just 3,380 kilometers (2,100 miles) from North Korea.\n\nTwo experts told CNN these flight details suggest the missile fired was likely a Hwasong-12 – an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) last tested in January.\n\n“This is a missile that North Korea started testing in 2017 … So it’s not really a new missile,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at CNS.\n\nBut, he added, its launch is significant because of the distance it can travel.\n\n“North Korea has a bunch of missiles that are shorter range, and that wouldn’t go over Japan – but they have a small number of missiles that could make that journey,” he said.\n\nWhy is this a big deal? Is it dangerous?\n\nNorth Korea usually fires its missiles into waters off the coast of the Korean Peninsula – making this flight over Japan considerably more provocative, for both practical and symbolic reasons.\n\nThis kind of unannounced launch could pose risks to aircraft and ships as the missile travels down to its target, since they would have no prior warning to avoid the area.\n\nAnd if the test had failed, causing the missile to fall short, it could have endangered major population areas. The missile flew over Japan’s Tohoku region, according to Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, which is home to more than 8 million people.\n\nIn the past, US planes have been grounded as a ‘precaution’ following North Korean missile launches. And in late November 2017, several commercial jet pilots were reported to have seen what appeared to be the re-entry of a North Korean missile as it approached the Sea of Japan.\n\nHowever, Lewis emphasized, such risks are statistically low, especially that far out in the Pacific and that high above Japan as it flew overhead. Mostly, it’s an escalation simply because “it’s provocative to fire a missile over your neighbor.”\n\n“For the Japanese especially, it feels like a violation of their sovereignty,” Lewis said. “If Russia fired a missile over Florida, we would have a fit.”\n\nAnd, experts say, it’s a sign of Kim’s ambitions for North Korea’s weapons development – and of what’s yet to come.\n\nWhy did North Korea fire the missile now?\n\nThere are differing opinions on what may have driven North Korea to fire Tuesday’s missile.\n\nRobert Ward, senior fellow for Japanese Security Studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, pointed to the multiple security threats faced by Japan, from an aggressive Russia to its north and China to its south.\n\n“North Korea may be trying to exploit the unstable international situation, which it will see as a tailwind,” he said.\n\nLewis disagreed, saying that although North Korea sometimes responds or retaliates to specific actions by Western players or groups, for the large part “they have their own schedule … and I don’t think that we have a lot of impact on the timing.”\n\nThere are also practical reasons; North Korea often takes breaks in testing during the summer when weather is bad, and pick up again once the fall and early winter arrive – meaning now could just be the right conditions for a test, he added.\n\nJoseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, added that Tuesday’s flight path could just make for a better test.\n\nThese types of missiles are meant for long-range targets – so flying it over Japan could help North Korea gauge its accuracy over a longer distance, its ability to withstand different forces exerted on the missile, and other factors, compared to its usual “lofted” tests – which travel higher in altitude and splash down west of Japan.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Explained: How much damage can North Korea's weapons do? 02:28 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nKim had vowed earlier this year to develop North Korea’s nuclear arms at the “highest possible” speed – and experts say Tuesday’s launch is part of that push for weapons advancement.\n\n“North Korea is going to keep conducting missile tests until the current round of modernization is done,” Lewis said, adding that a nuclear test could come “anytime.”\n\nSouth Korean and US officials have been warning since May that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, with satellite imagery showing activity at its underground nuclear test site.\n\nIf North Korea conducts a test, it would be the country’s seventh underground nuclear test and the first in nearly five years.\n\nThere are also other missile tests to watch. Apart from the Hwasong-12, North Korea also has three intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of flying over Japan, though these have not been tested “to their full range yet,” said Lewis.\n\n“This is probably an appetizer for the main course, which is yet to come,” he added. “I would expect that when North Korea has more confidence in one of their ICBMs, they might fly one of those to full range over Japan.”\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, added that North Korea could be waiting until after China holds its Communist Party Congress in mid-October to “conduct an even more significant test.”\n\n“The Kim regime is developing weapons such as tactical nuclear warheads and submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of a long-term strategy to outrun South Korea in an arms race and drive wedges among US allies,” Easley said.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Yoonjung Seo Brad Lendon Emiko Jozuka", "Jessie Yeung", "Yoonjung Seo", "Brad Lendon", "Emiko Jozuka"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/03/north-korea-ballistic-missile-japan-pacific-ocean/8172171001/", "title": "Japan sends emergency alert after North Korea fired ballistic missile", "text": "Hyung-Jin Kim, Kim Tong-Hyung, and Mari Yamaguchi\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Tuesday fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan, its neighbors said, escalating tests of weapons designed to strike key targets in regional U.S. allies.\n\nIt is the most significant missile test by North Korea since January, when it fired the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missile capable of reaching the U.S. territory of Guam. It is also the first time that a North Korea missile has flown over Japan since 2017.\n\nThe United States said it strongly condemns North Korea’s “dangerous and reckless decision” to launch what it described as a “long-range ballistic missile” over Japan.\n\n“This action is destabilizing and shows (North Korea’s) blatant disregard for United Nations Security Council resolutions and international safety norms,” it said.\n\nThe Japanese prime minister’s office said at least one missile fired from North Korea flew over Japan and was believed to have landed in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nJapanese authorities issued a “J-alert” to residents in northeaster regions to evacuate to buildings nearby, the first such alert since 2017.

He said the missile landed in waters outside the country’s exclusive economic zone after a 22-minute flight.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it also detected the launch of what it called a ballistic missile that was fired from the North’s northern inland area. It said the South Korean military bolsters its surveillance posture and maintains readiness in close coordination with the United States.\n\nSouth Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea launched an intermediate-range missile whose range is 2,485 miles. It is a range that places Guam within striking distance.\n\nYoon said he called a National Security Council meeting to discuss the launch and that the North’s “reckless nuclear provocations” would meet the stern response of the South and the broader international community.\n\nBoth South Korea and Japan convened emergency national security council meetings to discuss the launch. The U.S. said national security adviser Jake Sullivan had consulted with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts on their appropriate and robust responses.\n\n“The United States will continue its efforts to limit the DPRK’s ability to advance its prohibited ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, including with allies and U.N. partners,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.\n\nThe launch is the fifth round of weapons tests by North Korea in the past 10 days in what was seen as an apparent response to bilateral military drills between South Korea and the United States and the allies’ other training involving Japan last week. North Korea views such drills as an invasion rehearsal,\n\nThe missiles fired during the past four rounds of launches were short-range and fell in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Those missiles are capable of hitting targets in South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has test-fired about 40 missiles over about 20 different launch events this year as its leader Kim Jong Un vows to expand his nuclear arsenal and refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the United States.\n\nSome foreign experts say North Korea needs to master a few remaining technologies to acquire functioning nuclear missiles. Each new test pushes them closer to being able to reach the U.S. mainland and its allies with a host of nuclear-tipped missiles of varying range.\n\nSome experts say Kim eventually would try to use his enlarged arsenal to pressure Washington to accept his country as a nuclear state, a recognition that he thinks is necessary to win the lifting of international sanctions and other concessions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/asia/north-korea-missile-suspected-intl/index.html", "title": "Japan issues rare alert as North Korea fires missile without warning ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nJapan urged residents to take shelter early Tuesday morning after North Korea fired a ballistic missile without warning over the country for the first time in five years, in a major and potentially dangerous escalation of recent weapons tests by the Kim Jong Un regime.\n\nThe launch, which prompted immediate backlash from Tokyo and Seoul, comes amid a spate of missile tests, with five launches in the past 10 days, and follows renewed military drills between the United States and its regional allies.\n\nThe intermediate-range missile was launched from Mupyong-ri near North Korea’s central border with China at around 7:23 a.m. local time, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). It flew about 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles) for 20 minutes at an estimated maximum altitude of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) over Japan’s Tohoku region on the main island of Honshu before falling into the Pacific Ocean, some 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from the country’s shore, Japanese officials said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida strongly condemned the launch and called North Korea’s recent ballistic missile launches “outrageous” in comments to reporters at his official residence.\n\nTuesday’s launch is the country’s 23rd such missile test this year, including both ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nThere were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels near the missile trajectory, according to Japanese authorities, but the unannounced missile triggered a rare J-alert, a system designed to inform the public of emergencies and threats in Japan.\n\nIn such emergencies, alerts are sent out via sirens, through community radio stations and to individual smartphone users. On Tuesday, alerts were sent out at around 7:30 a.m. local time to people in Aomori prefecture, Hokkaido and Tokyo’s Izu and Ogasawara islands, according to Japanese officials.\n\nA tweet posted by Japan’s Prime Minister’s office urged residents to take shelter in buildings and to “not approach anything suspicious that is found and to immediately contact the police or fire department.”\n\nSouth Korea, US condemn missile launch\n\nOther governments were quick to decry the launch, with South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol branding it a “reckless” provocation, adding that North Korea will face a decisive response from the South Korean military and its allies.\n\nThe White House also “strongly condemned” the test, with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson calling it a “destabilizing” action that shows North Korea’s “blatant disregard for United Nations Security Council resolutions and international safety norms.”\n\nThe allies conducted a precision bombing exercise in response, which involved a South Korean F-15K fighter jet firing two air-to-surface munitions at a virtual target in a firing range west of the Korean Peninsula, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. South Korea and the United States conducted a similar exercise in March in reaction to another ballistic missile launch by North Korea.\n\nKim Seung-kyum, chief of the JCS, and Paul LaCamera, the United States Forces Korea commander, held a meeting after the launch and reaffirmed the combined defense posture will be further strengthened against any threats and provocations from North Korea, the JCS said.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command also released a statement saying American commitments to the defense of Japan and South Korea “remain ironclad.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with both his Japanese and South Korean counterparts after the launch.\n\nAnkit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regular missile testing was was part of North Korea’s plan to maintain its nuclear forces.\n\n“It is quite possible that the United States, South Korea and Japan will take away a message from this missile test that North Korea is continuing to assert itself to show that it has the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to targets including the US territory of Guam,” he said, adding that “risk reduction” to stop a crisis from escalating should be the current priority.\n\n“If such a crisis were to play out, it would play out under a significantly more advanced North Korean nuclear capability, which I think would significantly limit the options that the United States and South Korea would have, potentially to retaliate or manage escalation with North Korea,” he said.\n\nNorth Korea’s potential nuclear plans\n\nTuesday’s launch could herald an intensification of provocations by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, experts told CNN.\n\n“Pyongyang is still in the middle of a provocation and testing cycle and is likely waiting until after China’s mid-October Communist Party Congress to conduct an even more significant test,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n“The Kim regime is developing weapons such as tactical nuclear warheads and submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of a long-term strategy to outrun South Korea in an arms race and drive wedges among US allies.”\n\nFour previous missile launches occurred in the space of a week in late September and early October, around the same time US Vice President Kamala Harris made an official visit to Japan and South Korea, and as US, Japanese and South Korean navies held joint exercises.\n\nNorth Korea’s tests also come as international attention remains firmly focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and as both Moscow and Beijing appear reluctant to side with the West to further censure Pyongyang.\n\nIn May, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution to strengthen sanctions on North Korea for its weapons testing, in a vote the US said was likely to fuel Pyongyang’s program to develop nuclear-capable missile systems.\n\nWashington and the International Atomic Energy Agency have both warned this year that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, which would be its first since 2017.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, drew a connection between the missile tests and a potential nuclear test.\n\n“North Korea is going to keep conducting missile tests until the current round of modernization is done. I don’t think a nuclear (test) explosion is far behind,” he told CNN.", "authors": ["Yoonjung Seo Emiko Jozuka Junko Ogura Brad Lendon Simone Mccarthy", "Yoonjung Seo", "Emiko Jozuka", "Junko Ogura", "Brad Lendon", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/asia/north-korea-missile-tests-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "North Korea's Kim Jong Un wants the world to know he still matters ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nSince the turn of the year, North Korea has ramped up missile tests in defiance of international law at a frenetic pace that many who keep a close eye on the rogue state expect to continue.\n\nAccording to analysts, seven North Korean missile tests in the first four weeks of 2022 suggest the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, is both striving to meet domestic goals and show an increasingly turbulent world that Pyongyang remains a player in the struggle for power and influence.\n\n“By threatening to destabilize Asia while global resources are stretched thin elsewhere, Pyongyang is demanding the world pay it to act like a ‘responsible nuclear power,’” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThose seven missile tests have run the gamut, from what is believed to be a hypersonic glide vehicle – potentially one of the most powerful weapons on the planet – to an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), Pyongyang’s longest range missile tested since 2017 – to cruise missiles, arms that powers like the US have had in their inventory for decades.\n\nNorth Korea says it test-fired an intermediate missile, the Hwasong-12, on Sunday, January 30 (local time). Rodong Sinmun\n\nBut all fall into Kim’s pledge to make North Korea a power that can stand up to not only to its southern neighbor, but also to foes further afield, such as the United States. The IRBM that was tested Sunday, named in state media as a Hwasong-12 type missile, could have the range to hit the US island territory of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. Images released by North Korean state media, purportedly taken using a camera installed on the Hwasong-12, appear to show the missile in space looking back down at Earth.\n\nKim has reason to be concerned about a possible government change in Seoul in March’s presidential election. Conservatives behind presidential candidate Yoon Suk Yeol have a chance to unseat the current ruling democrats, fronted by Lee Jae-myung, who would succeed party colleague President Moon Jae-in if elected.\n\nAnalysts say a Yoon-led government could be expected to take a much harder line against the North compared to one led by Lee.\n\nYoon even planted the idea that South Korea could strike first against a perceived threat from the North, before the South might suffer a catastrophic loss.\n\n“I think it is a very important attitude for us to have,” Yoon said last week.\n\nAnd while Moon has held summits with Kim, a Yoon government could very well just ignore the North Korean leader’s regime, according to Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul.\n\n“Conservatives are supporters not so much of a tough position in relations with North Korea as of the maximum disregard for the very fact of the existence of another Korean state,” Lankov wrote on a blog for the Valdai Club, a Russian think tank.\n\nKim certainly got the attention of Moon with Sunday’s IRBM test.\n\nThe South Korean President said in a statement that the IRBM firing could be considered as a signal the Kim regime is preparing to scrap its moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and nuclear testing.\n\nThat moratorium has largely kept North Korea out of the international spotlight, but longer range missile tests could reverse that trend.\n\n‘No fire, no fury’\n\nAs for the US, President Joe Biden’s administration has largely put North Korea on the back burner, with foreign policy issues like China, Taiwan and most recently Ukraine dominating attention along with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWashington’s responses to North Korean launches in January are nowhere near its reaction to Pyongyang’s provocations in 2017, when Donald Trump was the US President.\n\nOn Sunday, a US official told reporters Washington was open to talks with Pyongyang, though the official said those would begin at a level lower than a direct meeting between Biden and Kim.\n\nThat has to be frustrating for the first North Korean leader to meet face-to-face with a sitting American President not once, but three times.\n\n“For better and for worse, Biden is showing no fire and no fury,” Easley said.\n\nPeople watch a TV showing a file image of North Korea's missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Jan. 30, 2022. Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nLeading up to his summits with Trump, analysts noted how Kim had finally succeeded in getting a seat at the table, a position he leveraged by testing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) that could theoretically reach the continental US. But when that seat did not yield any concessions from Washington, North Korea gradually resumed missile tests, albeit of a much shorter range.\n\nLast year, Biden’s first in office, North Korea staged eight tests – none in the range of an ICBM. But Sunday’s IRBM tests indicates that capability is still in the North’s inventory, and analysts say testing one now could be a big blow to a Biden administration already rocked by perceived foreign policy missteps like the US pullout from Afghanistan and the threat of war in Europe posed by Russia massing troops on its borders with Ukraine.\n\nThose situations are bound to play some role in congressional campaigns that may see Biden’s Democrats lose majorities in both the US House and Senate and impact the President’s chance of achieving any of his goals in the remainder of his term.\n\nA North Korean ICBM test could accelerate this trend, further damaging Biden’s and his party’s foreign policy credentials.\n\nNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons milestones\n\nWhile some analysts suggest North Korea’s current spate of testing leaves the door open for dialogue with Biden, others say it’s a matter of when, not if, Kim will order the testing of stronger weapons.\n\nThey say the Kim regime always does what it says it will do. And if you look at the goals set forth at North Korea’s 8th Party Congress in January 2021, Kim has begun to tick the boxes.\n\nThe first goal was to test a hypersonic warhead. That’s been done, most recently this month.\n\nAnother goal was testing a submarine-launched missile. That was achieved in October.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Author on what Kim Jong Un's series of missile tests may mean 02:31 - Source: CNN\n\nYet another goal was to “to develop tactical nuclear weapons which can be used for various missions,” according to North Korean state media. One of this month’s tests has been of “tactical missiles.”\n\nAs an ICBM was on that list too, a test is “just a matter of time,” said Duyeon Kim, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).\n\nThe North has previously tested an ICBM, but analysts say it could try to test a solid-fueled version. Solid-fueled ICBMs can be readied for action quicker than the liquid-fueled ones fired by Pyongyang to date.\n\n“Last January, Kim Jong Un already revealed goals to develop and test new ICBMs among other high-tech weapons as part of his five-year plan,” the CNAS analyst said.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what the US does or does not do … Pyongyang is squarely focused on meeting its nuclear weapons milestones,” she said.\n\nWith the Winter Olympics starting in just days in the capital of North Korea’s main ally, China, the world may see Kim take a breather from testing and let his friends in Beijing bask in the international attention.\n\nBut Pyongyang picking up the weapons testing pace again after the Games may suit Beijing just fine.\n\n“For China, as North Korea’s military power increases, the US has to pay more attention to the Korean Peninsula, so it can be expected to have the effect of distracting attention on Taiwan in this region,” said Park Won-gon, associate professor in North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University.\n\nIf that doesn’t give Kim a seat at the table, it at least gives him a foot in the door – and all the more reason to keep that door swinging wider.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Yoonjung Seo", "Brad Lendon", "Yoonjung Seo"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/us-assessment-north-korea-missile-test/index.html", "title": "US assesses North Korea preparing for possible long range missile ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNorth Korea appears to be preparing for a possible intercontinental ballistic missile test within the next 48 to 96 hours, just as President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to Asia, according to a US official familiar with the latest intelligence assessment.\n\n“The things we have noticed in the past for a launch are the things we are noticing now,” the official said. The launch site under satellite observation is located near Pyongyang. The official would not detail specifics of the current imagery, but typically, intelligence analysts look for signs of scaffolding or other launcher equipment, fueling, vehicles and personnel.\n\nBiden sets off for South Korea on Thursday and will hold meetings with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol before traveling to Japan on Sunday where he is set to meet with the leaders of Japan, Australia and India.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted a number of ballistic missile tests this year, and US military and intelligence agencies assess Pyongyang may also be preparing for its first underground nuclear test in nearly five years.\n\nThe US now believes that a North Korean missile launch on May 4 was a failed ICBM that exploded shortly after launch.\n\nThe US also had assessed that two ballistic missile tests on February 26 and March 4 involved a new ICBM that is under development by North Korea. According to the Pentagon the missile was originally shown for the first time at the Korean Workers Party parade on October 10, 2020. The tests earlier this year were intended as an evaluation and did not try to demonstrate the range of the ICBM. A test of the missile’s range could come come later.\n\nAfter making those findings public in March, the Pentagon increased surveillance activity in the Yellow Sea as well as “enhanced readiness” of US missile defenses in the region.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that US military and intelligence agencies assess that North Korea could be ready to resume underground nuclear testing.\n\nThat assessment concluded that Kim Jong Un’s government was making preparations at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site and could be ready to conduct a test by the end of the month. Signs of personnel and vehicle activity at the site had been seen through satellite imagery, but the officials do not know if the regime has placed nuclear material in one of the underground tunnels at the test site, which the US has been closely watching.\n\nIf North Korea conducts a test, it would be the country’s seventh underground nuclear test and first since 2017.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing Wednesday on Biden’s upcoming visit, South Korean deputy security adviser Kim Tae-hyo said a new intercontinental ballistic missile test by North Korea seems “imminent” but the possibility of a nuclear test seems “low.”\n\n“In the event of a North Korean provocation during the SK-US summit period, depending on the nature of the provocation, a plan B has been prepared so that the two leaders can immediately begin the command and control system of the combined defense posture, even if the existing schedule is changed,” Kim said.\n\nBiden and Yoon will discuss the most effective measures for deterring North Korean nuclear missiles along with other global issues, including issues in the Indo-Pacific and economic security, according to Kim.\n\nA summit between Biden and Yoon will take place shortly after their photo op at the presidential palace at 1:30 p.m. local time on Saturday, according to Kim. The two leaders will later hold a joint news conference before attending a dinner at the National Museum of Korea, Kim said.\n\nBiden’s trip to the region this week is only the latest instance where a US president has traveled to Asia amid the threat of a nuclear test: Pyongyang was preparing for a test in 2014 when then-President Barack Obama traveled to South Korea, and the country conducted a test soon after Obama and other leaders departed Asia in 2016.", "authors": ["Barbara Starr"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/asia/north-korea-missile-testing-frequency-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Why is North Korea firing so many missiles -- and should the West ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nTensions are running high in the Korean Peninsula, as the United States and its allies respond to North Korea’s flurry of recent missile tests – including one that flew over neighboring Japan without warning.\n\nNorth Korea has tested ballistic missiles seven times since September 25 – a prolific number, even in a year that has seen the highest number of launches since leader Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.\n\nThe aggressive acceleration in weapons testing has sparked alarm in the region, with the US, South Korea and Japan responding with missile launches and joint military exercises this week. The US has also redeployed an aircraft carrier into waters near the peninsula, a move South Korean authorities called “very unusual.”\n\nA US aircraft carrier and submarine, and South Korean and Japan warships, seen during a joint exercise on September 30. Handout/Getty Images\n\nInternational leaders are now watching for signs of a further escalation such as a potential nuclear test, which would be the hermit nation’s first in nearly five years – a move that would present US President Joe Biden with a new potential foreign policy crisis.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about North Korea’s rush toward nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why they’re ramping up now – and what, if anything, the US can do to counter Kim Jong Un.\n\nFirst, some context\n\nThe testing itself isn’t new – North Korea’s weapons development program has been ongoing for years.\n\nTensions reached near-crisis levels in 2017 when North Korea launched 23 missiles throughout the year, including two over Japan, as well as conducting a nuclear test. The tests showcased weapons with enough power to put most of the world in range, including the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n\nRelations thawed in 2018, when then-US President Donald Trump held a landmark summit with Kim. The two leaders “fell in love,” Trump said; in return, Kim praised their “special” relationship. North Korea pledged to freeze missile launches and appeared to destroy several facilities at the nuclear test site, while the US suspended large-scale military exercises with South Korea and other regional allies.\n\nBut the talks ultimately fell apart, and hopes for a deal that would see the North curtail its nuclear ambitions dwindled by the end of Trump’s term.\n\nThen the Covid-19 pandemic hit, pushing North Korea further into isolation. The already-impoverished country sealed its borders entirely, with foreign diplomats and aid workers fleeing en masse. During this time, the number of missile launches also remained low – just four in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How should the Biden administration handle the rising tensions with North Korea? 04:33 - Source: CNN\n\nSo why are they ramping up now?\n\nExperts say there are a few reasons North Korea is accelerating its testing so rapidly now.\n\nFirst, it could simply be the right time after the events of the last few years, with Kim declaring victory against Covid in August, and a new US administration in place that has focused on shows of unity with South Korea.\n\n“They’ve been unable to test for quite a few years due to political considerations, so I’d expect North Korean engineers and generals to be very eager to make sure their toys are going to work well,” said Andrei Lankov, a professor at South Korea’s Kookmin University.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said it’s also normal for North Korea to pause testing during the stormy summer and resume once weather improved in the fall.\n\nA television screen at Seoul Station in South Korea shows news of North Korea firing ballistic missiles on October 6. Kyodo News/Sipa USA\n\nBut, several experts said, Kim could also be sending a message by deliberately showcasing North Korea’s arsenal during a period of heightened global conflict.\n\n“They want to remind the world that they should not be ignored, that they exist and their engineers are working around the clock to develop both nuclear weapons and delivery systems,” said Lankov.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii, echoed this sentiment. Kim “launches missiles to generate attention towards himself, but also to create pressure for Japan and the United States to engage him,” he said.\n\nHe added that North Korea might also feel emboldened to act now while the West is distracted with the war in Ukraine.\n\nA worker observes the launch of an F/A-18E Super Hornet aboard a US aircraft carrier in the Sea of Japan on October 5. Communication Specialist Seaman Natasha Chevalier Losada/US Navy\n\n“(The missile tests) started in January, which is about the time we were beginning to report on what Russian President Vladimir Putin was doing opposite Ukraine,” said Schuster. “Kim Jong Un is doing what he thinks he can get away with – he’s not expecting any kind of strong US reaction.”\n\nLankov said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have also boosted Kim’s confidence because “it demonstrated that if you have nuclear weapons, you can have almost impunity. And if you don’t have nuclear weapons, you’re in trouble.”\n\nWhat can the US and its allies do to stop North Korea?\n\nDespite the US and its allies’ quick military response this past week, experts say there’s little they can do to stop or prepare for North Korea’s weapons tests.\n\n“The Americans sent the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. South Koreans are launching these missiles, which are not necessarily working well,” said Lankov, referring to a South Korean missile on Wednesday that crashed right after launch. “What is the impact of all these American aircraft carriers cruising around Korea? Pretty much nothing.”\n\nSouth Korean and US fighter jets fly over the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's missile launch on October 4 at an undisclosed location. , 2022 at an undisclosed location. South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty Images\n\nThough these shows of force might serve to deter North Korea from “starting a war” – which likely isn’t Kim’s plan, anyway – it does little to prevent further weapons development or missile testing,” he said.\n\n“It’ll probably make some people in the US and (South Korea) a bit happier, but it’ll have zero impact on North Korea’s behavior and decision making.”\n\nA lack of hard intelligence also means the US is largely left in the dark when it comes to Kim’s plans.\n\nThe North lacks the widespread use of technology that not only facilitates economic and societal advances, but also provides critical windows and opportunities to glean information for the intelligence services of the US and its allies.\n\n“Since so much of what North Korea does is driven by the leader himself, you really have to get inside his head, and that’s a hard intelligence problem,” said Chris Johnstone, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAnd on the international stage, the US’ efforts to punish North Korea have faltered due to pushback from Moscow and Beijing.\n\nIn May, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution to strengthen sanctions on North Korea for its weapons testing – the first time either country had blocked a sanction vote against the North since 2006.\n\nWhat is North Korea trying to achieve?\n\nKim has spearheaded an aggressive weapons development program that far outstripped efforts by his father and grandfather, both former North Korean leaders – and experts say the country’s nuclear program is at the heart of Kim’s ambitions.\n\nIn September, North Korea passed a law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, with Kim vowing to “never give up” nuclear weapons.\n\nThe law also demonstrated North Korea’s hopes of strengthening its ties with China and Russia, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\n\nAn Army Tactical Missile System is fired during a joint training session between the United States and South Korea, on October 5 at an undisclosed location. South Korean Defense Ministry/Getty Images\n\nAfter China and Russia’s open opposition to new sanctions against North Korea, Kim “knows he has their backing,” said Schuster.\n\nHe added that Kim’s weapons testing serves a dual purpose: apart from making a statement to the international community, it also boosts his own image domestically and cements the regime’s power.\n\n“It’s a very paranoid regime – (Kim) is as worried about the people under him as he is worried about regime change from the outside,” said Schuster. With the tests, Kim, is telling his own senior people, “We can deal with whatever the threat the West, the US and South Korea can come up with,” he said.\n\nHowever, in terms of wider public perception, KCNA, North Korea’s state-run media, has made no mention of missile launches for months – since its last report of a launch in March.\n\nLewis, the expert at the Middlebury Institute, added that North Korea will likely continue developing weapons such as ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missile until “they get to a point where they’re satisfied with that – then I think they’ll probably express an interest in talking again.”\n\nIs a nuclear test coming?\n\nThe concern in the short-term is whether North Korea will launch a nuclear test, which Lewis said could come “anytime.”\n\nHowever, Schuster and Lankov both said that given the friendly relationship between North Korea and China, Kim might wait until after China holds its high-profile Communist Party Congress later this month – if it happens at all.\n\nThe meeting of the party elite is the most significant event on the Chinese political calendar – especially so this year, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to be appointed to a third term in power, further cementing his status as the most powerful Chinese leader in decades.\n\nKim “depends too much on Chinese aid to keep his country afloat,” meaning he can’t afford to “do anything to detract from the Party Congress,” said Schuster. “So although China can’t dictate to him what he must do … he will not cause them problems.”\n\nAfter October, however, the runway is clear for any more significant weapons tests, said Lankov.\n\nSouth Korean and US officials have been warning since May that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, with satellite imagery showing activity at its underground nuclear test site.\n\nThis story has been updated to accurately reflect the number of missile launches since September 25.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Paula Hancocks Yoonjung Seo", "Jessie Yeung", "Paula Hancocks", "Yoonjung Seo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/asia/north-korea-missile-tests-united-states-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea boasts of 'shaking the world' by testing missiles that can ...", "text": "North Korea boasted on Tuesday that it is one of only a handful of countries in the world to field nuclear weapons and advanced missiles and the only one standing up to the United States by “shaking the world” with missile tests.\n\nInternational tension has been rising over a recent series of North Korean ballistic missile tests, actions long banned by the United Nations Security Council.

He has said the North Korean leader has not broken an agreement made in the U.S.-North Korean summit in June last year.\n\nThe development of highly mobile, submarine-based missiles represent a bigger threat to the U.S. and its allies than land-based missiles because they are harder to detect in time to respond.\n\nThe report said the projectile was fired in a \"vertical trajectory\" instead of in a more traditional launch-angle that would travel farther.\n\nIf fired at a standard trajectory, the missile could have traveled 930 to 1,240 miles, said Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, in a Facebook post, according to The Associated Press.\n\nShin Jong-woo from the Korea Defense and Security Forum in Seoul said the missile appeared similar to a Chinese JL-2 SLBM, indicating that North Korea aims to develop a submarine-launch missile that can carry three to eight warheads, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe test-firing came as North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator, en route to working-level talks in Sweden with the U.S., expressed \"high expectations and optimism\" over the discussions.\n\n\"As the U.S. side sent a new signal, I bear high expectations and optimism, and I am also optimistic about the results,\" Kim Myong-gil told reporters at Beijing International Capital Airport.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton, in his first remarks since leaving the Trump administration in early September, said Monday that Kim has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons.\n\n“The strategic decision Kim Jong Un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further,” Bolton said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/asia/north-korea-cruise-missile-nuclear-threat-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Kim Jong Un talks up North Korea's nuclear threat after latest missile ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Thursday warned adversaries his nuclear forces are fully prepared for “actual war,” a day after the isolated country’s latest launch in a recent flurry of missile tests.\n\n“Our nuclear combat forces … proved again their full preparedness for actual war to bring the enemies under their control,” Kim said in a report by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nKim’s fiery statement – his first about North Korea’s missile program for several months – came after he reportedly oversaw the test Wednesday of long-range cruise missiles over waters west of the Korean Peninsula, according to KCNA.\n\nWednesday marked the 26th missile test of either cruise or ballistic missiles by the Kim regime this year, according to a CNN count, though analysts stressed that the KCNA reports should be treated with caution as North Korean state media had previously overstated the success of such launches.\n\nOn Monday, North Korean state media broke six months of silence over this year’s spate of missile tests, claiming they were part of a series of simulated procedures intended to demonstrate Pyongyang’s readiness to fire tactical nuclear warheads at potential targets in South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has ramped up missile tests this year, leading to fears it plans to carry out its first nuclear test since 2017. KCNA/KCNA\n\nIn Monday’s report, KCNA said North Korea’s recent missile tests showed the country’s forces were “fully ready to hit and wipe out the set objects at the intended places in the set time.”\n\nKim Jun-rak, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that North Korea launched two cruise missiles from the Kaechon area, South Phyongan province, from 2 a.m. local time Wednesday over the West Sea, also known as the Yellow Sea.\n\n“The South Korean military was aware of the situation in real time and maintained a readiness posture by closely cooperating with the US while strengthening surveillance and vigilance,” Kim said at a briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command said it had no comment on the reports of Wednesday’s test.\n\nThe KCNA report claimed the cruise missiles tested Wednesday flew oval and figure-8 patterns for almost three hours above the sea before hitting their target.\n\nNuclear test fears\n\nAnalysts stressed caution over the KCNA reports.\n\n“It is worth remembering that the details of these reports cannot be trusted,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The Kim regime is sometimes surprisingly transparent about weapons development goals, but it also tends to exaggerate strength and capabilities.”\n\nBut Easley and others stressed that the North Korean reports should not be dismissed as pure bluster by South Korea and the West.\n\nKim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said North Korean missile tests show a progressing program even if current strengths are exaggerated.\n\n“The fact that Kim Jong Un oversaw this missile launch suggests that the cruise missile is at the final stage of development,” he said.\n\nCruise missiles have substantial differences with ballistic missiles, which have formed the large majority of North Korea’s tests this year.\n\nA ballistic missile is launched using a rocket or rockets, then travels outside of Earth’s atmosphere, gliding in space before reentry and then descending powered only by gravity to its target.\n\nA cruise missile is powered by a jet engine, stays inside Earth’s atmosphere during its flight and is maneuverable with control surfaces similar to an airplane’s.\n\nCruise missiles have smaller payloads than ballistic missiles, so would require a smaller nuclear warhead than a missile designed to hit the mainland United States, such as an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, but no such restriction applies to the testing of cruise missiles.\n\nNorth Korea’s ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on any kind of missile is unproven.\n\nShin Beom-chul, South Korea’s vice defense minister, told local radio station SBS Thursday morning the spate of missile testing and threatening announcements from Pyongyang shows North Korea may be building up to testing a nuclear device for the seventh time. Its last test was in 2017.\n\n“North Korea is testing various missiles. And now they’ve tested cruise missiles, and I think they’ll test the tactical nuclear weapon part that can be loaded on each warhead,” Shin said.\n\n“North Korea hasn’t conducted a tactical nuclear test, so it needs to make the nuclear warheads smaller and verify them,” he said.\n\nEven if it doesn’t test a nuclear weapon, North Korea’s new propaganda campaign presents a problem, said Easley, the Ewha University professor.\n\n“Pyongyang’s military threats are a chronic and worsening problem for peace and stability in Asia,” Easley said.\n\n“Policymakers in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington should not allow domestic politics and other challenges such as Russia’s war in Ukraine to prevent them from increasing international coordination on military deterrence and economic sanctions” on Pyongyang, he said.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Yoonjung Seo", "Brad Lendon", "Yoonjung Seo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}]}

The concert was scheduled to be a makeup for his Nov. 3 performance, which was cut short when he lost his voice.\n\nWest raised eyebrows Thursday night at his show in San Jose, Calif., when he told concertgoers that he didn't vote in the presidential election, but he \"would've voted on Trump.\" He continued to applaud Trump's campaign approach as \"absolutely genius\" and confirm that he was still considering a presidential run for 2020, which he famously announced during last year's MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nHe fanned the flames Saturday night with his stop in Sacramento, when he ranted about Beyoncé, alleging that the pop star wouldn't have performed at this year's VMAs had her video, Formation, not been awarded video of the year.

Matar pleaded not guilty, according to Nathaniel Barone, his public defender. The attorney said Matar has been “very cooperative” and communicating openly, but he did not discuss the content of those conversations.\n\nHe was refused bail and remanded to the Chautauqua County Jail. Matar’s next court appearance is Friday.\n\nRushdie, 75, was stabbed on stage at the Chautauqua Institution before he was slated to give a lecture, New York state police said Friday. He was airlifted to a hospital in northwestern Pennsylvania and underwent surgery, a Pennsylvania police official said. The hospital said it had no update to provide on his condition Saturday.\n\nRushdie’s injuries included three stab wounds to the right side of the front of his neck, four stab wounds to his stomach, a puncture wound to his right eye, a puncture wound to his chest, and a laceration on his right thigh, according to Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt, who provided details of the injuries during Matar’s arraignment.\n\nRushdie may lose his right eye, the county prosecutor added.\n\nOn Friday, Rushdie was put on a ventilator and was unable to speak, his agent, Andrew Wylie, told The New York Times. “The nerves in his arm were severed; and his liver was stabbed and damaged,” Wylie said. “The news is not good.”\n\nThe FBI is working with local and international authorities in its investigation into the attack, including “international partners in the United Kingdom to provide additional resources, since the victim is a UK-US dual citizen,” a spokesperson told CNN on Saturday.\n\nSuspect described as ‘quiet’ and keeping to himself\n\nThe attack occurred around 10:45 a.m. as Rushdie was being introduced, a witness told CNN. A man in a black shirt appeared to be “punching” the author. The witness, who was about 75 feet from the stage, did not hear the attacker say anything or see a weapon.\n\nAnother witness, Joyce Lussier, was sitting in the second row when she saw a man leap across the stage and lunge at Rushdie. She heard people screaming and crying and saw people from the audience rushing up to the stage, she said. Staff and audience members rushed to the attacker and put him on the ground before a state trooper took him into custody, police said.\n\nA witness who asked not to be named and said they saw the attack captured photos of the suspect being detained. The owner of a boxing gym where Matar was a member confirmed the photos are of Matar. And the suspect’s attorney also verified to CNN the photos appear to be his client.\n\nPhotos of Hadi Matar were captured by a witness moments after the attack. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe witness told CNN they were among those who rushed on stage after the attack to offer help and then went outside where they captured the photos of Matar.\n\nThe witness said there were medical professionals from the audience who also rushed to help. “I have no training that would have helped,” the witness added. “I was just operating on adrenaline and instinct.”\n\nOn Friday evening, police had blocked off the street to the New Jersey home believed connected to the suspect.\n\nMatar frequented a boxing gym in North Bergen, New Jersey, where members say he was quiet and mostly kept to himself. CNN exclusively spoke with State of Fitness Boxing Club owner Desmond Boyle, who said Matar enrolled at the gym in April.\n\n“You know that look, that ‘it’s the worst day of your life’ look? He came in every day like that,” Boyle told CNN on Saturday.\n\nRoberto Irizarry, a member of the gym, told CNN Matar frequented the gym about three or four times a week and was “a very quiet kid.”\n\n“It’s a brotherly environment, family environment – we try to involve everybody. He was to himself, pretty much,” Irizarry said.\n\nQuestions raised around security precautions\n\nFollowing the attack, questions were raised about the security precautions – or lack thereof – at the host institution, which sits in a rural lake resort about 70 miles south of Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe institution’s leadership had rejected recommendations for basic security measures, including bag checks and metal detectors, fearing that would create a divide between speakers and the audience, according to two sources who spoke with CNN. The leadership also feared that it would change the culture at the institution, the sources said.\n\nThe two sources have direct knowledge of the security situation at the Chautauqua Institution and past recommendations and spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nA police officer, center, carries out a bag from the amphitheater after author Salman Rushdie was attacked during a lecture Friday at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York. Joshua Goodman/AP\n\nIt’s unclear whether the recommended measures would have prevented the attack on Rushdie based on the information released about the incident as of Friday evening. Authorities have not disclosed the type of weapon that was used in the attack.\n\nThere were no security searches or metal detectors at the event, a person who witnessed the attack told CNN. The witness is not being identified because they expressed concerns for their personal safety.\n\nCNN reached out to the Chautauqua Institution and its leadership for comment but did not receive a response Friday.\n\nInstitution president Michael Hill defended his organization’s security plans when asked during a news conference Friday whether there would be more precautions at future events.\n\n“We assess for every event what we think the appropriate security level is, and this one was certainly one that we thought was important which is why we had a State Trooper and Sheriff presence there,” Hill said. “We will assess for each of the events at the Institution what we think the appropriate level of security is and that’s an ongoing process that we work in concert with local law enforcement on.”\n\nThe suspect arrived in Chautauqua at least a day before the event and bought a pass to the event two days prior, Schmidt said during Matar’s arraignment.\n\nMatar traveled to Chautauqua by bus and had cash, pre-paid Visa cards and false identification with him, Schmidt added.\n\n“This was a targeted, pre-planned, unprovoked attack on Mr. Rushdie,” Schmidt said.\n\nBoth Schmidt and Barone, the suspect’s public defender, said Matar has no documented criminal history.\n\nAlso injured Friday was Henry Reese, co-founder of the Pittsburgh nonprofit City of Asylum, who was scheduled to join Rushdie in a discussion, police said. He was taken to a hospital and treated for a facial injury and released.\n\nAn Iranian leader had called for Rushdie’s death\n\nThe world reacts to attack on Salman Rushdie\n\nReese is on the advisory committee for press freedom group PEN America, which tweeted a message from him late Friday: “Salman Rushdie is one of the great authors of our time and one of the great defenders of freedom of speech and freedom of creative expression.”\n\nReese added, “We revere him and our paramount concern is for his life. The fact that this attack could occur in the United States is indicative of the threats to writers from many governments and from many individuals and organizations. In addition to wishing Salman well as Americans and citizens of the world, we need to re-commit ourselves to defending the values Salman has championed.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden said in a statement he was saddened by the attack.\n\n“Salman Rushdie — with his insight into humanity, with his unmatched sense for story, with his refusal to be intimidated or silenced — stands for essential, universal ideals. Truth. Courage. Resilience. The ability to share ideas without fear. These are the building blocks of any free and open society,” Biden said.\n\nRushdie’s writings have garnered several literary prizes, including the Booker Prize for his 1981 book, Midnight’s Children. But it was his fourth novel “The Satanic Verses,” that drew the greatest scrutiny as some Muslims found the book to be sacrilegious, and its publication in 1988 sparked public demonstrations.\n\nThe late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who described the book as an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.\n\nIran’s bounty was never lifted\n\nRushdie, the son of a successful Muslim businessman in India, was educated in England, first at Rugby School and later at the University of Cambridge where he received a master’s degree in history.\n\nAfter college, he began working as an advertising copywriter in London, before publishing his first novel, “Grimus” in 1975.\n\nIn 1989, as a result of the fatwa, Rushdie began a decade under British protection.\n\nRushdie told CNN in 1999 that the experience taught him “to value even more … intensely the things that I valued before, such as the art of literature and the freedom of expression and the right to say things that other people don’t like.\n\n“It may have been an unpleasant decade, but it was the right fight, you know. It was fighting for the things that I most believe in against things I most dislike, which are bigotry and fanaticism and censorship.”\n\nThe bounty against Rushdie has never been lifted, though in 1998 the Iranian government sought to distance itself from the fatwa by pledging not to seek to carry it out.\n\nDespite that, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recently reaffirmed the religious edict.\n\nIn February 2017, on Khamenei’s official website, the supreme leader was asked if the “fatwa against Rushdie was still in effect,” to which Khamenei confirmed it was, saying, “The decree is as Imam Khomeini issued.”", "authors": ["Paul P.

But police waited inside the school for about an hour before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt’s not clear how many of the 19 children or two teachers killed might have been saved had police entered earlier.\n\n“The devastating injuries that many of those kids sustained, there’s no doubt some of those children bled to death while waiting for police to make entry,” said CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner.\n\n“There’s just no question in my mind that probably took place,” Ramsey said Sunday. “There’s no way you can justify that.”\n\nBut it’s not fair to direct all blame at the school district police chief, who authorities say made the decision to not immediately breach a classroom door, Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio, said Sunday.\n\n“At the end of the day, everybody failed here,” he said. “We failed these children. We even failed them in the Texas Legislature.”\n\nIt’s unclear what changes will happen on the state or federal levels to help curb school shootings and public massacres. The elementary school slaughter in Uvalde marked at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in just the first five months of this year.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited Uvalde on Sunday to offer his sympathy and support. Just 12 days earlier, Biden visited New York state after a racist massacre at a Buffalo grocery store killed 10 people.\n\nThe suspects in both massacres were 18 years old and had legally purchased their weapons.\n\nThe disturbing new timeline\n\nIn active shooter situations, all law enforcement officers in Texas are trained to move in and confront the attacker, according to the active shooter guidelines in the state’s commission on law enforcement 2020 training manual.\n\n“As first responders we must recognize that innocent life must be defended,” the manual says. “A first responder unwilling to place the lives of the innocent above their own safety should consider another career field.”\n\nThose guidelines apparently weren’t followed in Uvalde.\n\nAfter days of public clamoring, authorities in Texas released a clearer timeline of how the tragedy unfolded.\n\nUvalde police officers entered the school about two minutes after the shooter, said Col. Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nBut the incident commander at the scene – the school district’s police chief – believed the situation had transitioned from an active shooter to a “barricaded subject,” McCraw said.\n\nIt’s not clear why the district police chief, Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, may have believed that.\n\nOfficials said Arredondo made the call for officers to not go inside the classroom while they waited for the room’s key and tactical equipment. CNN has attempted to reach Arredondo, but with no response.\n\nDuring a window of about 70 minutes, officers went inside the building and called for more resources, such as equipment and negotiators, McCraw said.\n\nUp to 19 officers were standing in the hallway more than 45 minutes before police entered the classroom.\n\nEventually, members of a border patrol tactical team arrived at the scene, entered the classroom and killed the gunman – more than an hour after the shooting started.\n\nMcCraw, the DPS director, said officers should have confronted the shooter immediately.\n\n“It was the wrong decision, period,” he said. “There’s no excuse for that.”\n\nOn Sunday, the US Department of Justice announced it will review the police response to the shooting at Robb Elementary.\n\nBut for Alfred Garza, whose 10-year-old daughter Amerie Jo was killed in the shooting, “it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that it just took too long to get in there.”\n\n“Had they gotten there sooner,” Garza said, “and someone would have taken immediate action, we might have more of those children here today – including my daughter.”\n\nDonations of blood, food and funeral services\n\nA teddy bear sits in front of crosses with the names of the 21 victims killed at Robb Elementary School. Jae C. Hong/AP\n\nSince the massacre, graduations and other celebratory events have been canceled as the community mourns the shattering loss of some of its most vulnerable.\n\nFuneral homes in Uvalde have committed to covering costs for families of the 21 victims. Some services will begin Monday.\n\n“We have fought together as a community and we will pull together as one now in our time of need,” Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home wrote on its Facebook page.\n\nThe Rushing-Estes-Knowles Mortuary echoed support for the Uvalde community: “Today, our resolve is stronger than ever. We are here for the people of Uvalde,” the funeral home said the day of the shooting.\n\nOmar Rodriguez, the owner of a car detailing business, made 250 hamburgers to raise funds for the victims’ families.\n\nAt a friend’s lot on Main Street, Rodriguez set up a large grill, tables and supplies to cook while his family and friends grabbed rags and soap to wash cars for a donation.\n\nThe 24-year-old said he couldn’t just stay at home, knowing he could do something to help.\n\n“This is a good little town,” Rodriguez said. “There’s nothing but love here.”\n\nCarlos Hernandez, owner of the restaurant Carlito’s Way in Uvalde, cooked and gave away more than 60 family-sized platters Thursday to feed mourning families and neighbors still trying to grasp the tragedy inflicted on their tight-knit community.\n\n“Showing the families we care is what we do. I want them to remember how we joined in at the time of need,” Hernandez said.\n\nEven strangers have traveled from hours away to help those suffering in Uvalde.\n\nPatrick Johnson, 58, drove for seven hours from his hometown of Harleton, Texas, to Uvalde and set up a table filled with toys for children who haven’t smiled in days.\n\n“There’s a lot of ways to be a blessing to people,” he said. “Whenever something like this happens, I do my research and contact local law enforcement and ask ‘what I can do?’ What does your community need right now?”\n\nJohnson, a father of four, said he broke down and wept when he heard about the shooting.\n\n“I’m not even from this community, but I’m hurting.

They are suspended with pay, he said.\n\nThe Mulberry police officer is on administrative leave pending the investigation’s outcome, his department said.\n\nAnalysts: Use of force seems excessive\n\nThe video, which was posted on social media, shows the officers restraining an individual – identified by state police as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina – near a curb outside a business. One officer throws punches at the person’s face and slams his head to the ground, while another knees the individual in the side and back.\n\nA woman who is not seen on the video says, “Don’t beat him! He needs his medicine!” One officer responds, “Back the f**k up!” while another orders her to get in her car.\n\n“We do not know what would happen if that person would not have been videoing,” said Carrie Jernigan, one of Worcester’s attorneys. “The fight was escalating with those officers and you hear that woman on that video yelling, and whoever that is, I think she could’ve saved his life.”\n\nDamante declined to get into many specifics, emphasizing the case remains under investigation, but said the actions he saw on the video are “not indicative of the Crawford County Sheriff’s Department or any law enforcement agency in this area.”\n\nThe deputies “will be punished for what they did, if they’re found to be in violation of any rights,” the sheriff said.\n\nNone of the officers was wearing a body camera, but the Mulberry officer had a dashboard camera on his squad car, which provided details on how the scuffle began, the sheriff said without elaborating.\n\nRandal Worcester leaves the Crawford County Justice Center in Van Buren, Arkansas, on Monday. Andrew DeMillo/AP\n\nTwo CNN senior law enforcement analysts say, judging solely from the video footage, the use of force appears excessive.\n\nWorcester is charged with second-degree battery, resisting arrest, possessing an instrument of crime, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, terroristic threatening and first- and second-degree assault, Arkansas State Police said.\n\nWorcester allegedly threatened a gas station clerk in a neighboring town, Damante told CNN affiliate KHBS. When he was spotted in Mulberry, Worcester was initially cooperative, but then tried to attack the officers, leading to the confrontation in the video, Damante told the station.\n\nThe suspect told officers he had a weapon, but the sheriff believes Worcester handed it over before the fight ensued, he told reporters Monday.\n\nWorcester suffered multiple abrasions to his face, scrapes on his knees, scratches, a swollen right ear and had his eye gouged during the altercation with the law enforcement officers, attorney David Powell said.\n\n“Lots of things happened to him that should not have happened during this altercation,” Powell said.\n\nWorcester was released on $15,000 bail, Powell said. He had his bicycle with him as attorneys escorted him out of the detention center, and he gave no audible response to a reporter’s question. He will be staying with family, his lawyers said.\n\n‘It doesn’t make sense’\n\nFor two CNN senior law enforcement analysts, there remain questions about what happened before and after the moment caught on video. Yet even if Worcester attacked the officers as alleged, the level of force with which they respond seems excessive, the analysts said.\n\n“Especially the blows to the face and head,” said former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. “At one point in time, you see one of the officers actually lift the head and push it down into the pavement. Obviously, that raises the level of force considerably.” It also heightens the risk of serious injury or death, he said.\n\nRamsey continued, “Certainly the blows to the head at the same time you’re trying to get a person to put their hands behind their back – think about it. It doesn’t make sense. If you’re getting hit in the face, you’re going to lift your hands to try to protect your face.”\n\nRamsey and fellow CNN analyst Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, say it’s difficult to imagine what could necessitate the officers’ violent response.\n\nCrawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante says officers did not wear body cameras. KHBS\n\n“It is important to remember that this video only catches a portion of the interaction between this individual who was arrested and the three officers,” McCabe said. “Importantly, those officers maintain that before the video that he attacked one of them, punched him in the head, pushed him to the ground. So, there was obviously a scuffle here that led to the use of force.\n\n“However, what we see on that video, it is very, very hard to argue that what you’re seeing – the sort of punches and the kneeing him in the back and slamming his head … on the ground. That is not acceptable, normal, standard police use of force under really any circumstances.”\n\nIt’s important to consider there are three officers on a single suspect, McCabe said, and the lawmen do not appear to be using any accepted techniques for handcuffing a suspect.\n\nRather, it appears to be an “incredibly violent assault seemingly on a person on the ground and under the control of three officers,” he said. “I’m finding it impossible to justify what you’re seeing on that video really in any way.”\n\nIf attacked, police have a right to respond with necessary, proportionate and objectively reasonable force, Ramsey said, but the Arkansas officers’ reactions seem neither proportionate nor reasonable. Being attacked “doesn’t give you permission to then use excessive force when taking the individual into custody, period. It just doesn’t,” the former police chief said.\n\nSuspect held on $15,000 bail\n\nThe person who posted the video online said her sister witnessed the altercation outside the Kountry Xpress in Mulberry.\n\n“In reference to the video circulating on social media involving two Crawford County Deputies, we have requested that Arkansas State Police conduct the investigation and the Deputies have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation,” the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.\n\nThe Mulberry police officer is on administrative leave pending the investigation’s outcome, his department said.\n\n“The City of Mulberry and the Mulberry Police Department takes these investigations very seriously and holds all their officers accountable for their actions,” a Mulberry police statement said.\n\nRandal Worcester stands charged with assault, battery and other counts. Crawford County Sheriff's Office\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson found the officers’ actions to be “reprehensible conduct in which a suspect is beat in that fashion,” but said the video shows only a “glimpse” of the encounter.\n\nWithout elaborating, he said Worcester “had a history of concern that was legitimate for the officers” but also said the officers’ response was “not consistent” with their training.\n\n“This is not what our law enforcement community represents. It’s not the proper response, and they will be reviewed and appropriate action taken consistent with” the findings of the investigation, the governor said.\n\nArkansas State Police issued a statement saying its investigation “will be limited to the use of physical force by the deputies and the police officer,” and its findings will be submitted to a local prosecutor who will decide if the use of force was consistent with state law.

It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Cnn Business Video John General Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/14/pa-grand-jury-report-catholic-clergy-sexual-abuse-names-details-catholic-dioceses/948937002/", "title": "List: Names, details of 301 Pa. priest sex abuse allegations in ...", "text": "On Aug. 14, Pennsylvania released a statewide grand jury report on what the state attorney general's office called an \"honest and comprehensive accounting of widespread sexual abuse by more than 300 priests.\"\n\nThe report, more than 800 pages long, lists the name of 301 priests and provides details into specific accusations.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude.

The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P. Hopkins\n\nUnknown Dates: Pastor St. Titus Church in Titusville, PA\n\n1920s: Pastor at unknown church in East Brady, PA\n\nSummary: In 1993, a victim wrote a letter to Bishop Trautman at the Diocese of Erie where she stated in in 1945, when she was 13, she experienced abuse at the hands of Hopkins in the rectory of St. Titus. She stated that Hopkins would, \"grab our face in his hands, force us to look up, and then plant a sloppy kiss on our mouths … and fondle us wherever he pleased.\"\n\nIn 1994, the victim wrote another letter to Trautman. The bishop wrote back that \"Since Monsignor Hopkins died in July of 1957, there is no possible way to investigate your accusation.\"\n\nBarry M. Hudock\n\n8/01/1997 - N/A Catholic University, Faculty, Washington, DC\n\nSummary: Hudock was 27 in 1996 when he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a girl in her junior year of high school. Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

All three men and several of their sisters testified that Jeselnick and a previously unidentified deacon would come to their house and get intoxicated. Once the adults were drunk, Jeselnick would find the boys and pray on them.\n\nIn 2014, Jeselnick sent a letter seeking suitability for ministry.

Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P. Luzzi\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/09/1962 - 8/29/1968: Faculty, Venango Christian High. Residence at St. Joseph, Oil City, PA\n\n8/28/1968 - 8/28/1969: Sp.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D.

He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Called the Nexx360, the officer’s collar holds four wide-angle cameras. Instead of capturing footage of a narrow field of view in front of the officer, this system gives an all-around view. “This has the potential for being a game-changer,” said Sheriff John Shearon. “There are times when we don’t get good footage of an encounter. The officer may be moving to protect themselves or others; the other person may be moving. An officer doesn’t need to think about where they need to be to get the best body camera footage. This solves that problem.” The cameras serve as a “dispassionate observer,” said Terry Luck, a longtime defense attorney whose practice is in Montgomery. The technology also allows dispatchers – and supervisors – to get real-time images of what’s happening. That’s a huge advantage in rural counties, where help in the form of backup can be 20 minutes or more away, Shearon said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she recently tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on social media, Murkowski said she recently tested positive after experiencing flulike symptoms. The statement did not specify the timing of the test. Her campaign posted photos of events that Murkowski participated in Friday and Saturday in Fairbanks. “I will be following guidance and advice from doctors and will be quarantining at home in Alaska while continuing my work remotely,” Murkowski’s statement said. Karina Borger, a spokesperson in Murkowski’s Senate office, said by email that Murkowski is “vaccinated and boosted.” Borger said she had nothing more to share beyond the social media post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Beginning this month, students whose jobs or income were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can receive free tuition, monthly stipends and employment help in a range of workforce programs from manufacturing to health care at Maricopa County’s 10 community colleges. Phoenix is using $7 million of its federal pandemic relief funds to finance the “Route to Relief” program, which will run through December 2024. Eligible students can get up to $5,000 for tuition, fees and books. Training-related expenses, job search expenses and career services in programs such as semiconductor, health care, business, manufacturing and information technology also are covered. Students also will get monthly stipends during their studies of up to $1,500 for other expenses such as child care and transportation.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Power has been restored across the Arkansas River Valley after storms last week caused outages in Roland, Oklahoma and Paris. But a heat wave will continue through the first part of this week with triple-digit temperatures in Fort Smith. There is a 50% chance for rain Thursday with a high of 98 degrees, the National Weather Service reported. An excessive heat warning was issued for 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday in Fort Smith and Sebastian County. High fire danger continues during an ongoing drought.\n\nCalifornia\n\nForest Falls: A man died and a woman was injured when the pair tumbled down a waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains, authorities said. Rescue crews responding Sunday afternoon found the woman performing CPR on the man at Big Falls near the community of Forest Falls, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said. The man, a 43-year-old resident of Hemet, died at the scene, the department said. The 43-year-old woman from Riverside was airlifted to a hospital, officials said. Their names were not immediately available. Officials said the pair fell from the middle falls to the lower falls at the popular destination along a hiking trail about 80 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has temporarily blocked the city of Superior from enforcing parts of a new gun control ordinance, including a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons, after it was challenged by gun rights groups. U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Moore issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, noting the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, the National Association for Gun Rights and a Superior resident, Charles Bradley Walker, had established a likelihood to prove their case in challenging two sections of the ordinance. Moore scheduled an Aug. 4 hearing to determine whether to continue to keep Superior from enforcing those sections. The other section requires people who had assault weapons before the law took effect on July 1 to get a permit to continue to possess them but largely only on their own property. The law defines assault weapons as a number of different semi-automatic weapons. Moore’s ruling included several references to last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a New York law that required people to show why they needed a concealed weapons permit. He noted that the court found that Americans have the right to bear commonly used arms in public, subject to reasonable and well-defined restrictions, and that governments must identify “an American tradition” to justify any limits on their use.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The City Council gave the green light to the Norwich Community Development Corporation to apply for a $500,000 Brownfield Remediation Grant from the state’s Community Investment Fund to help remediate and redevelop the Reid and Hughes department store, a vacant building on Main Street. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the funding is needed to take care of asbestos, lead pipes, and other areas that aren’t up to modern code compliance. The plan for the building is to create 17 apartments and a first-floor retail space. Heritage Housing, Inc. is the developer interested in the Reid and Hughes building. It already owns the Wauregan Building across the street.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Senate Democrats voted in a special session to seek to remove Delaware’s state auditor from office, an action criticized as meaningless “political theater” by the Democratic House speaker. Senators voted 13-7 for a resolution to hold a joint session of the Legislature regarding the removal of Auditor Kathy McGuiness, a Democrat. Senate Democrats contend that McGuiness should be removed from office for betraying the public trust. McGuiness, who is responsible as auditor for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was convicted this month on misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest, official misconduct and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. She was acquitted on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. The case marked the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official had been convicted on criminal charges. The Senate resolution must also be approved by the House, but Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf said he has no intention of calling his chamber into special session. “This isn’t taking decisive action: it’s political theater,” Schwartzkopf, a longtime political ally of McGuiness, said in a statement issued by Democratic House leadership.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police are investigating after a 7-year-old boy was hit by a car driven by an 11-year-old boy in Southeast D.C. on Monday night, WUSA-TV reported. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the unidentified boy was hit in a playground parking lot, located on the 3500 block of Stanton Road, just after 6:30 p.m. Police believe the juvenile driver lost control of the car and wasn't able to hit the brake before running into the child. The car also hit a curb. When first responders arrived, they found the boy conscious and breathing. The 11-year-old driver of a 2020 Kia Optima ran away from the scene after the crash, but was located by police Tuesday. The family of the injured boy said he is expected to be OK, but he is recovering from a leg injury in the hospital.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Four people, including a 5-year-old boy, were injured when a car crashed through an unoccupied toll booth and ended up in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said. The crash happened just before 5 p.m. Sunday along Daytona Beach, where vehicles are allowed on the sand. The driver of the car, Christian Rivera Rosado, 28, of Springfield, Massachusetts, apparently had a seizure and lost control of his Nissan Altima, according to a report from Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. The car smashed through the empty toll booth at the International Speedway Boulevard beach approach in Daytona Beach and ended up in the water, Volusia County Beach Safety officials told news outlets. The child, identified as David Alamos of Nashville, Tennessee, was taken to a hospital in Daytona Beach and then airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. The child he was released from Halifax Health Medical Center later Sunday. Rosado was also taken to the hospital as a trauma alert, the report said. Rosado, who said he didn’t remember the incident, was cited for careless driving, the report stated. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection. The five voters from Greene’s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A swimmer at a beach in Waikiki was injured last weekend after encountering an endangered Hawaiian monk seal with a young pup. Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a nonprofit conservation organization that helps monitor protected species, said their workers witnessed a swimmer come into contact with the mother monk seal known as Rocky on Sunday morning. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement the victim is a 60-year-old elementary school teacher from California. The woman received lacerations to her face, arm and back, the agency said. State officials said they would not recommend charges or fines for the woman and are not naming her because she requested anonymity. The Hawaii Marine Animal Response said in a statement the seal gave birth to a pup about two weeks ago on Kaimana Beach in Waikiki, the same area where the swimmer was injured. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Marine Animal Response have been watching the pair and warning people to stay away. It is against the law to touch, harass, injure or kill monk seals, of which there are less than 1,600 remaining in the wild. People are told to stay at least 150 feet away from a mother seal and pup, though that recommendation is not a law.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Tom Arkoosh, an attorney from Boise, said he’s running for Idaho attorney general as the Democratic nominee. Arkoosh announced his candidacy amid family and friends at the Statehouse. He’s replacing Steve Scanlin, who withdrew from the race last week and was a placeholder for the Democrats. Arkoosh will face former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador in the November general election. Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the May Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man who died after being stabbed on a commuter train early Monday apparently threatened or tried to rob the person who wounded him, authorities said. The stabbing occurred at about 3 a.m. on a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line train on the city’s South Side, police said. Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said video footage reviewed by investigators suggested the man was with a group who threatened or tried to rob someone else on the train. Video showed the man holding a gun before the individual targeted by the group used a knife to stab him, Deenihan said during a news conference. The man suffered wounds to his chest and later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Deenihan said investigators haven’t identified anyone else involved yet. No arrests have been made.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Thousands of people arguing the abortion issue surrounded the Statehouse and filled its corridors Monday as lawmakers began to consider a Republican proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the effort during a meeting with Democratic state legislators. Harris said the abortion ban proposal reflected a health care crisis in the country. Despite the bill’s abortion ban language, anti-abortion activists lined up before a legislative committee to argue the bill wasn’t strict enough and lacked enforcement teeth. Indiana is one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court decision last month overturning Roe v. Wade. Indiana’s Republican Senate leaders proposed a bill last week that would prohibit abortions from the time an egg is implanted in a woman’s uterus with limited exceptions – in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. Republican Senate leaders said the bill would not add new criminal penalties against doctors involved with abortions, but they would face possibly having their medical licenses revoked for breaking the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:As three more families sue Tyson Foods over COVID-19 deaths among workers at its Iowa plants, the meatpacking giant is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for protection. Tyson’s attorneys filed the petition Friday, asking the country’s highest court to hear their case and rule that a March 2020 executive order by President Donald Trump shielded the company from legal liability, Bloomberg Law reported. Trump’s order instructed the secretary of agriculture to take “all appropriate action” to keep the country’s meat and chicken processing plants open as COVID-19 spread, though it did not prohibit them from temporarily closing their plants. In their petition, according to Bloomberg, Tyson’s attorneys wrote the company followed “the federal government’s instructions to help avert an impending national food shortage.” They added that Tyson executives “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if the company is subject to lawsuits.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt is trying to get ahead of arguments that an anti-abortion measure up for a statewide vote next week would hinder medical care for patients with life-threatening pregnancies. Schmidt, a Republican running for governor who supports the measure, argued in a legal opinion issued Friday that treating miscarriages, removing dead fetuses and ending ectopic pregnancies do not fall under Kansas’ legal definition of abortion. The proposal on the ballot Aug. 2 would amend the Kansas Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. It’s the first referendum on abortion policy by a state since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Funding is available to help boost the Kentucky tourism industry, which saw a decline in visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The state will allocate $75 million over the next several weeks to help eligible tourism organizations that apply and show the impact of the virus, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act and was allocated by the General Assembly earlier this year. It will be distributed in four ways. Officials said $25 million will go to local tourism commissions to market their communities, $25 million will be used to attract conventions and meetings, $15 million will go toward statewide marketing and $10 million will be available for multicounty collaborations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Mayor-President Josh Guillory said he has checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcohol addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Guillory said in a news release he will be at an in-patient facility for 21 days. A statement from the city said Guillory will remain in authority over Lafayette Parish and city government. Through arrangements with the facility, Guillory will have access to a computer and internet service and will be able to review and sign contracts, ordinances and other documents. Guillory’s biography on the city’s website said he enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard in 2001 and led a platoon in Iraq in 2005.\n\nMaine\n\nNewry: A decision by state regulators could make it difficult for the owners of a potentially rich lithium deposit in western Maine to extract the metal. The owners of the Newry property asked the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to review the possibility of quarrying at the site. However, regulators decided earlier this month the site would be viewed as a metallic mineral mine and not a quarry operation, said Maine mining coordinator Michael Clark on Monday. Maine’s mineral mining laws are among the strictest in the country. The Freeman family, which owns the land, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. New sources of lithium are in demand in the U.S. because the metal is crucial to the development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid cars.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Democratic U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger has tested positive for the coronoavirus, his office said Monday. Ruppersberger, who represents Maryland’s 2nd District, tested positive on Sunday night. The congressman’s symptoms are mild and he is working from home while isolating, his office said. He is fully vaccinated and has had a booster shot. Ruppersberger, 76, is serving his 10th term in Congress. This is the second time this year that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He also had a positive test in January and reported mild symptoms at the time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: After a whale crashed into a fishing boat and others were seen off the South Shore coast in the past week, the state is warning boaters to use caution as a group of young humpbacks feeds in Plymouth Harbor. The state’s environmental agencies have warned all boaters, kayakers, paddleboarders and others on the water to watch out for three juvenile humpback whales that have been feeding near Plymouth for at least a week. The young whales’ behavior is “very unpredictable,” the state said, and they are feeding on schools of fish in shallow waters. A whale on Sunday struck a fishing boat off the coast of Plymouth after breaching with several boats nearby. The whale hit one of the boats and caused the bow to dip down into the water. Two people on the boat braced themselves as the boat tipped forward and back, a video showed. A paddleboarder had a close encounter with a whale off Manomet last week, and amateur wildlife photographer Suzanne O’Shea managed to photograph a breaching whale off the coast of Plymouth on July 19. The whales feeding and breaching in the area have brought residents and tourists in the hopes of catching a glimpse. Most of the whales have been humpback, which can measure up to 55 feet and weigh up to 40 tons, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the conservation of whales. It is illegal to harass marine mammals under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act. Harassment includes any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that can injure or disrupt the feeding behavior of the animal. The National Marine Fisheries Service recommends that boaters stay at least 100 feet away from whales and take caution given the unpredictable behavior of whales and the potential safety hazards involved.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Dozens of University of Michigan medical students walked out of a weekend ceremony to protest a speaker who publicly opposes abortion rights. Dr. Kristin Collier, an assistant professor of medicine, was the keynote speaker Sunday at an annual event where new medical students are formally welcomed and given a white lab coat. A video of some students walking out was posted to social media and has received more than 11 million views. Collier didn’t refer to abortion in her remarks, but she has shared her opinions on social media and in interviews. A petition signed by 340 medical students, including some of the new ones, had urged the university to drop Collier as a speaker. Spokeswoman Mary Masson said the university “does not revoke an invitation to a speaker based on their personal beliefs.” Dr. Joseph Kolars, a senior associate dean, said Collier was nominated to speak by members of a medical school student honor society. He told the audience that she is an “enormously popular teacher and physician.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mekhi Speed, 18, a cousin of Amir Locke, was sentenced to more than 16 years for his role in a January murder that prompted police to execute a no-knock warrant on the apartment where Locke was killed by a SWAT team officer. Speed pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony – namely aggravated robbery – in connection with the Jan. 10 killing of 38-year-old Otis Elder. Speed, who was 17 when Elder was shot, told the court during his plea hearing that he had a handgun when he and others tried to rob Elder of drugs in St. Paul, and there was a struggle and a shot was fired. Speed said he had no memory of pulling the trigger and didn’t know if his accomplice was armed. As St. Paul police were investigating Elder’s murder, they identified Speed as a suspect and obtained search warrants for Minneapolis apartments associated with him. Locke, Speed’s cousin, was not a target of the investigation and was not named in the warrants, but he was in one of the apartments as a Minneapolis SWAT team entered the unit without knocking on Feb. 2. Video showed Locke, 22, who was Black, was shot seconds after police entered the apartment before 7 a.m. He was on a sofa wrapped in a comforter, and video showed he was holding a gun in the moments before he was shot. Minnesota prosecutors declined to file charges the against Officer Mark Hanneman, saying his use of deadly force was justified.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia: With a population of 64, the village of Satartia in Yazoo County is Mississippi’s smallest town, but it will soon hold a celebration of something unusually large – a fictional catfish named Eli that lives in the nearby Yazoo River. The Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River Festival on July 30 will be an evening of music, food, fireworks and might be one of the only festivals around where you can rent a catfish. “It’s going to be epic,” said Michele Harris, president and event coordinator of the non-profit Moving Satartia Forward. “It’s going to be so much fun.” Eli isn’t a real catfish. He’s the focus of an award-winning children’s book; Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River. He lives in the river under a bridge, which is a stone’s throw from the village. In the book, a boy and girl set out to do what no one has done – catch the legendary fish. Instead, they develop a friendship with Eli and become his protectors. Eli is now a part of the town’s identity. There’s even a 3,500-pound wooden sculpture of the fish in downtown Satartia created by artist Alexander Brown.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis has joined a growing list of Democrat-led cities seeking to help women gain abortion access, even in red states that have largely banned the procedure. Not long after Democratic Mayor Tishaura Jones signed a measure providing $1 million for travel to abortion clinics in other states, Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued to stop what he called a “blatantly illegal move to spend Missourians’ hard-earned tax dollars on out-of-state abortions.” The give-and-take is emblematic of city versus state fight playing out since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The St. Louis law called for using federal COVID-19 relief money for a “Reproductive Equity Fund.” The funding is part of a larger health care package that also offers postpartum support, lactation help, doula assistance and money for COVID-19 testing and vaccine incentives. Jones said during a news conference before signing the bill that she expected a lawsuit from Schmitt, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in the Aug. 2 primary, and who has filed dozens of lawsuits ranging from efforts to halt mask mandates in schools to a suit against China over the coronavirus.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A helicopter search crew looking for two missing Montana climbers in Glacier National Park spotted their bodies Monday, park officials said in a statement. The men, both 67, were reported overdue Sunday from their planned climb of Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s center. They set out for the climb on Thursday and planned to hike out on Friday. Park rangers found their vehicle at a trailhead Sunday and search crews first took to the air later that day, park officials said. Authorities were making a plan to recover the men’s bodies and their belongings, the park statement said. Their identities were not immediately disclosed.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts remains noncommittal about calling a special legislative session to address abortion, despite many Republican lawmakers pushing to outlaw the procedure. Abortion opponents don’t appear to have the 33-vote super majority needed to overcome a filibuster waged by abortion-rights supporters. Abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska. Those seeking an abortion must receive counseling and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. People under 19 must have parental consent to undergo an abortion.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thirteen Nevada Republicans announced a new coalition to endorse Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford in his re-election bid against their party’s nominee, Sigal Chattah, a conservative who bested a more moderate Republican primary contender. The announcement of “Republicans for Ford,” first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, signaled a major shift in party support as the group is headlined by a former rival of Ford’s – former state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, along with former GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian. Chattah won the June Republican primary by 11 percentage points over Tisha Black, a more moderate candidate who had the backing of Nevada’s Republican establishment. A Las Vegas-based lawyer, she is one of a few conservative GOP candidates in Nevada who won their primary races against more moderate opponents. Chattah sued Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak over pandemic restrictions on behalf of a church and has often painted Black as a Democratic sympathizer throughout the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state sued several pharmacy chains Tuesday, becoming the latest government entity seeking to hold them accountable for fueling the nation’s opioid epidemic. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General John Formella called CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and their subsidiaries “the last link in the opioid supply chain and the critical gatekeeper between dangerous opioid narcotics in the public.” It accused the companies of flouting their duty to protect public health and safety by failing to stop suspicious prescriptions and diverted drugs. Opioids – including prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly produced fentanyl – have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000, and the number of cases reached a record high in 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBernards: Capt. Robert Terry and his wife Estelle were posthumously awarded the Tuskegee Airmen Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony Thursday at the couple’s former home across from the original Somerset Hills Airfield off Lord Stirling Road. The gold medals were commissioned by President George W. Bush in 2001. “This is outstanding,” said Qaaim Saalik, son of Robert and Estelle Terry, accompanied by his daughters Malika Ra and Ramdasha Bikceem, cousin David Booker and close family friend Kumar Best. “I am very proud of them. I know my parents would look down on this occasion with great, great joy.” Brooks Betz, researcher for the Mr. Local History Project, campaigned for the couple’s honors. Over two years, he prepared a detailed story about the couple’s experiences with the Airmen. Robert Terry served as a Tuskegee Airmen flight instructor and pilot from 1943 to 1945. He helped train 992 pilots, 350 of whom were deployed in the war and served with distinction. A licensed pilot, Estelle Terry might have been the first Black woman pilot in New Jersey, Betz said. She also served among the 14,000-member ground support personnel as a mail clerk and packing parachutes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Mayor Tim Keller said the city’s most visible unsanctioned homeless encampment will close next month. Keller said the exact date for Coronado Park’s closing hasn’t been decided. City officials said an estimated 120 people camp nightly at the park and occupants will be told about other housing options. They said increasingly dangerous conditions such as narcotics trafficking and usage combined with prolonged damage to the park’s irrigation and vegetation created safety concerns and were the leading factors in the decision to close the park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A preacher known for his close friendship with Mayor Eric Adams was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewelry Sunday by armed bandits who crashed his Brooklyn church service, just as he was sermonizing about keeping faith in the face of grave adversity, police said. Bishop Lamor Miller-Whitehead, who embraces his flashy lifestyle and can often be seen driving around the Big Apple in a Rolls Royce, was delivering a sermon at his Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries when police said three robbers walked in. They showed guns and demanded property from Miller-Whitehead and his wife, Asia K. DosReis-Whitehead, police said. The service was also being livestreamed online. In the video, which appears to have been removed from the church’s social media channels, Miller-Whitehead is heard asking his flock, “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” moments before the robbers entered the church. He’s then seen dropping to his hands and knees and repeatedly saying, “all right, all right,” before a man holding a gun and wearing a black sweatshirt enters the frame. The man, who was also wearing a black mask, is then seen approaching Miller-Whitehead, who was hiding behind a gold-colored lectern, and stuffing the bishop’s jewelry into his pockets. Another man, dressed in similar garb, is then seen heading toward Miller-Whitehead, lingering near him for a few minutes and then running off. Miller-Whitehead said in a video posted to Instagram that the robbers ripped his collar off to grab his chain and held a gun to his infant daughter’s face while stealing his wife’s jewelry. Police said the robbers fled in a white Mercedes that was last seen on Avenue D near the church, in Brooklyn’s Canarsie neighborhood. Neither Miller-Whitehead, 44, nor DosReis-Whitehead, 38, were physically injured, police said. They daughter was also unharmed.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A construction worker at Charlotte Douglas International Airport was electrocuted, according to a California-based company for whom he worked. The Charlotte Observer reported Rosendin Electric, a company based in San Jose, California, filed a report Monday morning confirming Sunday’s death at the airport. John Mallow, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said the death was caused by electrocution. The worker’s identity has not been released and the labor department is investigating the incident, Mallow said. It’s not immediately known what project the worker was involved with when he died, or what time it happened. The airport began several construction projects in 2015. The west side of a $608 million terminal lobby expansion recently opened to passengers, but some parts of the lobby, such as ticketing booths and additional lighting, are still being installed. There also are other ongoing projects across the airport complex.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer said the U.S. Environment Protection Agency awarded $280,000 to the state Department of Environmental Quality to implement a program to provide drinking water assistance to underserved, small and disadvantaged communities in the Tri-County Water District.\n\nOhio\n\nMilford Township: A medical helicopter responding to the scene of a fatal accident crashed early Tuesday when it hit power lines, but no one on board the aircraft was seriously injured, authorities said. Three crew members were in the CareFlight helicopter on the way to an accident involving two pickup trucks that occurred about 4:15 a.m. in Milford Township, according to the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. The aircraft was approaching the scene when it crashed into the power lines and went down. According to a statement issued by CareFlight, no patients were in the aircraft, which was being operated by Air Methods, and the crew members were able to safely exit the helicopter. The cause of the crash will be investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Butler County Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer told WXIX-TV that one crew member suffered “an unknown injury” and was taken to a hospital. The other two crew members were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Authorities said one person was killed in the vehicle accident and three other people were injured. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A couple has been charged in the death of a woman whose body was found last year wrapped in plastic in the basement of a home. Margarita Sandoval, 19, had been missing for three years when police found her body in May 2021 in a box hidden underneath some stairs in a home in Norman. After a 14-month investigation, Normal police charged Sandoval’s brother, 35-year-old Octavio Sanchez, and her sister-in-law, 27-year-old Desiree Sanchez, each with murder and unlawful removal of a dead body. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Sandoval’s death a homicide. Investigators said Sandoval had moved in with the couple in their Norman home in January 2018. Several months later, other family members began looking for Sandoval after not hearing from her. Police said Sandoval, who had limited cognitive abilities, had called authorities to report that the couple had been abusive to her. Police alleged the Sanchez couple had continued to collect Sandoval’s disability payments up until her body was discovered.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Temperatures soared to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in Oregon’s largest city on Tuesday, which was expected to be the hottest day of a scorching spell that will be unusually long for this part of the U.S. It was also a new daily record for the city for July 26, besting the previous high set in 2020. Oregon health officials said there has been an uptick in the number of people reporting heat-related illness in emergency departments, and the number of those calling emergency services numbers for similar symptoms. “Heat-related illness daily visits are above expected levels statewide,” said Jonathan Modie, lead communications officer at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division. He said there were 32 such visits to emergency departments on Monday compared to three to five per day before the heat wave began. Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency across much of the state, warning the extreme temperatures might cause utility outages and transportation disruptions. Portland officials opened cooling centers in public buildings and installed misting stations in parks. TriMet, which operates public transportation in the Portland metropolitan area, will allow passengers who cannot afford fares to ride for free when heading to cooling centers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBaden: Punk’s Ice Cream Shoppe has been forced to temporarily close after a car crashed into the building Sunday night. Owner Mariellen Ketterer said the incident occurred about 7 p.m. when a car struck the building’s left side along State Avenue in Baden. The shop was open for business at the time but was forced to close immediately, and Ketterer announced on Facebook it would remain closed until further notice. It is unknown why the car crashed into the building or if the driver or anyone else was injured during the accident. Officers from the Baden Police Department were unavailable to comment on Monday afternoon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The ACLU of Rhode Island said it is concerned a system recording audio and video in the City Clerk’s office might be illegally capturing conversations between visitors in the room. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown wrote to Mayor Roberto L. DaSilva earlier this month, after receiving a complaint from someone visiting City Hall who saw a sign indicating that video and audio surveillance was taking place. In his letter, Brown asked DaSilva for more information about the system and asked that he “take immediate steps to address the legitimate privacy concerns that this surveillance technology raises.” DaSilva, in a three-page response to Brown, wrote a video system has been in place since 2014, but that audio in the clerk’s office was added several weeks ago after “a few customer complaints related to their interactions with city employees.” “Please be assured that the City believes that its use and placement of cameras and audio recordings is fully compliant and consistent with ‘reasonable expectations of privacy’ and various statutory requirements,” DaSilva said in his letter to Brown.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina can continue enforcing its six-week abortion ban after a judge denied a request to temporarily block it amid a legal fight that is now headed to the state Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and other plaintiffs had asked the judge for an injunction while their lawsuit challenging the ban moves through the courts. The lawsuit argued the law violates the state constitution’s rights to privacy and equal protection. South Carolina Deputy Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick on Tuesday argued voters did not intend to cover abortion rights when they approved the state’s right to privacy in 1971.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:An animal rights organization filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking for an investigation into a Sanford Research scientist. The complaint from Stop Animal Exploitation Now was filed by the group after it obtained a document showing that privileges to perform experiments on animals by Shanta Messerli had been permanently revoked. A letter from Sanford Research to the USDA’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare indicated Messerli’s privileges were revoked in January 2021. After an appeal to the Sanford Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, her privileges were restored to perform two specific experiments under direct supervision. But the letter, signed by David Pearce, the president of innovation and research for Sanford’s World Clinic, said Messerli received a subsequent report of noncompliance while conducting an experiment with funding from the Department of Defense. The USDA has the authority to regulate animal research laboratories. The self-reported letter from Sanford Research to USDA was dated May 2. A Sanford spokesperson did not immediately respond for comment. The USDA did not immediately respond.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a new commander for the second time in about a month. Col. Brian D. Sawser assumed command of the expansive district at a ceremony Friday in Memphis, the Corps said in a news release. Lt. Col. Robert W. Green had been named commander in mid-June, and the Corps had said Green would be handing over command to Sawser this month. Sawser now leads a district that covers 25,000 square miles in parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. He is responsible for flood damage reduction, navigation, environmental stewardship, emergency operations and other civil works along 610 miles of the Mississippi River and the White River. The district manages levees, tributaries, harbors and navigation channels connected to the river.\n\nTexas\n\nBalch Springs: A grass fire apparently sparked on the shoulder of a freeway swept about 300 yards across tinder-dry open field to a suburban Dallas subdivision Monday, burning through wooden fences and torching a row of at least eight homes on the subdivision’s edge. The blaze was the latest in drought-stricken north Texas, which has been vulnerable to wildfires for at least two weeks. It was initially unknown what sparked the fire just off Interstate 20 in Balch Springs about 4 p.m. Monday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Aerial video showed the fire spread up and down the street as firefighters and homeowners working in 103 degree heat tried to prevent the fire from spreading to more of the bricked frame homes. One end of the fire spread to a home where a panicked dog ran back and forth before running through a pet door at a neighboring home. The dog’s fate was not immediately known. Fire crews from Dallas and other nearby suburbs have gone to the scene to assist Balch Springs crews.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 6,870 new cases. That’s down 11.8% from the previous week’s total of 7,789. Utah ranked 34th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Cases fell in seven counties, with the largest declines in Salt Lake County, with 2,765 cases from 3,162 a week earlier; in Utah County, with 1,156 cases from 1,284; and in Tooele County, with 167 cases from 226.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Federal prosecutors said a man charged with killing his mother at sea in 2016 in a plot to inherit millions should remain behind bars pending trial because he poses a flight risk and danger to others. The prosecutors filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Burlington on Friday, opposing a request by Nathan Carman to be released. Carman, 28, who lives in Vernon, was charged in May with killing his mother, Linda, of Middletown during a fishing trip in 2016 off the coast of New England in which his boat sank. He was found floating in a raft and rescued eight days after departing from a Rhode Island marina. He pleaded not guilty in May in his mother’s death. Prosecutors also have accused Carman of killing his grandfather, John Chakalos, who they said was shot in his home in Windsor in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather’s estate. Carman has not been charged in that case. Earlier this month, Carman’s attorneys filed a motion seeking his release, saying the evidence against him is “tenuous at best” and he does not pose a flight risk or danger. The attorneys said Carman is willing to surrender his passport, submit to electronic monitoring and turn over all the money he has – $10,000 – to a third party or post some of that money as bail.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state police has temporarily reduced the operating hours for its Med-Flight helicopter service in central and southwest Virginia because of a shortage of pilots. The state police said until more pilots can be hired and trained, the service has been reduced from 24-hour coverage to 16 hours a day, from 8 a.m. through midnight, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The changes went into effect on Sunday. In the meantime, private, for-hire air ambulance services such as those offered by VCU Health Systems and HCA Hospitals will fill the gap in the Richmond area. Med-Flight is free, but the private services bill patients for the transport. In most cases, the fee is covered by a patient’s health care insurance.\n\nWashington\n\nRoyal City: A Moses Lake woman drowned Sunday trying to rescue a dog in a canal, according to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies and medics responded at about 12:45 p.m. to a report of a woman who fell into a canal off Dodson Road Southwest, near Road 12 Southwest, about 3 miles east of Royal City, the Longview Daily News reported. Witnesses told deputies the 46-year-old woman, later identified as Brigetta Delgado, was trying to rescue a dog when she fell into the canal. She went under and did not resurface, becoming trapped by the turbulence in a plunge pool. Her body was recovered once the water released its grip. Delgado’s body was transported to the coroner’s office for an autopsy and her family was notified.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is now able to process some services that have been affected by a system mainframe outage. The agency is using a workaround to process commercial driver’s licenses, driver’s licenses, instruction permits and driver’s license reinstatement transactions, according to a news release Tuesday from the Department of Transportation. The division is continuing to work with the Office of Technology to restore all services, the release said. Customers should visit the DMV website for up-to-date alerts before they visit a regional office or try the online portal, the Department of Transportation said. The outage was first reported last Wednesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Former President Donald Trump plans to visit Wisconsin to campaign for his endorsed candidate for governor, Tim Michels – an announcement made just two days after Michels said he wouldn’t prioritize a key piece of Trumps’ agenda: to decertify the 2020 presidential election results. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Waukesha County Fairgrounds at 7 p.m. Aug. 5, the Friday before the Aug. 9 primary election. Gates are expected to open at 2 p.m., with first speakers to deliver remarks at 4, followed by Trump at 7. Michels faces former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Tim Ramthun in the Republican primary for governor and has surged in recent polling to the top of the field as he spends millions of his own money to blanket television airwaves since entering the race in April. The primary winner will go on to run against Democratic incumbent Gov. Tony Evers in the general election.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A lawsuit filed Monday by a Casper women’s health clinic and others seeks to block Wyoming’s new abortion ban just before it’s scheduled to take effect. The lawsuit claimed the new law violates the state constitution with restrictions that will discourage potentially life-saving pregnancy health care in Wyoming, forcing pregnant women to go to other states for necessary procedures. As with all Wyoming laws challenged in court, Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill will defend the new law set to go into effect Wednesday, Michael Pearlman, spokesman for Gov. Mark Gordon, said by email. Gordon, a Republican, signed the ban on nearly all abortion in Wyoming in March. The ban was to take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which happened June 24. After a more than three-week review, Hill last week gave the go-ahead for Gordon to certify the law to take effect Wednesday. The law will outlaw abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. Wyoming until now has allowed abortions up to the point of viability outside the mother, or about 23 weeks into pregnancy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/28/flag-garden-healing-touch-parade-ban-lifted-news-around-states/116658070/", "title": "Flag garden, healing touch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday vetoed legislation to delay next year’s requirement to hold back third graders who aren’t reading at grade level – a postponement lawmakers sought after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted classrooms. The veto means the promotion requirement will take effect at the end of the 2021-22 school year. The governor said it is “hasty and premature” to delay the requirement before education officials can review the newest test scores. “As a former teacher and even more so as governor, I believe early literacy is the gateway to all learning,” Ivey said in a statement. The Republican governor said she is asking the state superintendent to brief the public on spring test scores when available and for the Alabama Committee on Grade Level Reading to make recommendations regarding any future action. “Everyone agrees that the past 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been hard on all Alabamians, including school personnel, students and parents. However, to establish any delay at all in the Alabama Literacy Act prior to analyzing the 2020-2021 summative assessment data for reading would be hasty and premature,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city’s schools will be getting more than $112 million in funding from the latest round of federal coronavirus relief, and officials want the public to weigh in on how to spend it. The Anchorage School District received more $62 million from two prior rounds of federal pandemic aid and expects to get the latest disbursement as early as July, Alaska’s News Source reports. A school board town hall Wednesday night invited residents to offer input, and officials also distributed a survey in an effort to gather feedback.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Coconino County and its most populous city are dropping mask mandates they implemented last June to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Flagstaff Mayor Paul Deasy announced Tuesday that the city’s face-covering proclamation that took effect June 20 would end Wednesday, and the county Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to rescind the county’s mandate June 1. The county’s action affects only unincorporated areas, and any mask mandates imposed by local and tribal governments may still be enforced, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Deasy cited wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines and declining case numbers. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of the CDC and our local health departments and urge our residents to do the same,” Deasy said in a city statement. Businesses can still require face coverings and social distancing on private property, the statement said, and face coverings are still required on public transportation, at the airport and in other areas required by federal law.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A local business announced Wednesday that it has received federal emergency use authorization for its coronavirus antibody test that uses a drop of blood from a finger. The authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for use in moderate-complex settings and at the point of care. “The ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test is literally a lab at the tip of your finger, specifically designed to make diagnostic testing possible at home,” said Kevin Clark, chief executive officer of NOWDiagnostics Inc. “This EUA approval is the first step in making that a reality.” The rapid-results finger-stick test is not meant to find an active infection but can tell if a person has had COVID-19 and might still have some immunity. Because it’s entirely self-contained, the test can be done on the spot without a doctor, pharmacist or other trained professional with specialty equipment. The test would also not need to be sent to a lab for processing. During the emergency use authorization, however, it will only be used by trained professionals. The devices have been sent throughout the nation, and NOWDiagnostics in Springdale is on track to produce 2 million of the ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test devices per month. The facility now employs about 95 people. The company has 65 patents related to the device.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Disneyland fans won’t need an address in the Golden State to get into the park beginning June15. Disneyland and Disney California Adventure will welcome visitors from outside the state in mid-June, park officials said Wednesday. The park reopened in late April after a 412-day, pandemic-induced shutdown – but only to California residents. Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel, one of the on-site hotels, will also reopen that day, followed by iconic Disneyland Hotel on July 2. Disney said the state of California “strongly recommends” – but does not require – that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or obtain a negative coronavirus test before visiting. Face coverings, however, are required. Travelers need to have a ticket and theme park reservation for the same park on the same date.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: El Paso County agreed Tuesday to pay $65,000 to settle a federal lawsuit alleging that mismanagement by the sheriff led to a COVID-19 outbreak in the jail last year. The payment approved by county commissioners will cover attorneys’ fees paid by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit, The Gazette reports. Wellpath of Nashville, Tennessee, the company paid to provide health care in the Colorado Springs jail, will pay an additional $30,000 as part of the deal. In exchange, the ACLU agreed to drop the lawsuit without a finding a fault by Sheriff Bill Elder. Spokespeople for the sheriff’s office and Wellpath declined to comment on the settlement Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed after more than 1,000 inmates at the jail contracted COVID-19 last fall – the largest outbreak among jails and prisons in Colorado. It alleged that inmates were not given masks for months and were punished for making their own, which the ACLU said helped create a “mammoth, preventable” crisis. Jail officials have said they worked with county health officials to manage cases in the jail. They said they could not distribute masks initially because the only ones available had metal staples, which they said created unspecified safety concerns.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A week after lifting most COVID-19 restrictions in the state, Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday that his focus is now on getting people back into their offices and back to normal summer activities. Lamont joined other state officials and business leaders at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford to tout the state’s high vaccination rate and low coronavirus infection rate. “I have spent the last year-plus saying stay safe, stay home, and today I’m telling you, get out of the damn house, come enjoy Hartford, get on a plane, visit a restaurant, visit an amazing hotel,” he said. Connecticut has seen new cases go from a seven-day average of about 427 cases per day May 10 to just about 167 new cases, according to data from John’s Hopkins University. That’s down from more than 2,000 a day in January. More than 1.8 million residents have been fully vaccinated, and more than 60% have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the governor’s office. Connecticut Economic and Community Development Commissioner David Lehman said Connecticut’s economic activity is about 92% of what it was pre-pandemic, which ranks 19th in the nation. “So we are better than average, but we need to get that to 100%, and really we need to get that beyond 100%,” he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the coronavirus shutdown hit many nonprofit groups and community organizations hard, it also forced them to think of new ways to reach people, and that knowledge could propel them for years to come. “There are so many things we would have never done if it wasn’t for the pandemic,” said Mike Connolly, the executive director of the New Castle Historical Society. Before the shutdown, the group offered tours and programs at the Amstel House, Dutch House and Old Library and operated the Visitor Center at the Arsenal. COVID-19 meant the end to most indoor tours and adjusting other programs for social distancing. “Outdoor walking tours were an easy way to accommodate people during capacity restrictions,” Connolly said. The group was also able to open the historic gardens. But the key to staying relevant was being online. “We had to keep people aware that we’re here, and a lot of that had to go virtual,” Connolly said. “The biggest accomplishment was learning how to do things differently, getting out of our routine. It allowed us to expand the way we do things.” Before the pandemic, the society never held a webinar. “Suddenly we were attracting people from other states and other countries who couldn’t attend before,” Connolly said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Now that people can more freely travel just in time for Memorial Day weekend, the nonprofit organization Destination D.C. is expecting an increase in travelers to the city, WUSA-TV reports. “There are still free things to do in D.C., so this really has been our opportunity to really deliver that message,” said Theresa Belpulsi, vice president of tourism with Destination D.C. “I feel very confident about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, international travel will be slower to return until we open up the borders, but for the most part, we are focused on domestic visitation, and we look forward to a fantastic summer.” Museums and monuments consistently draw tourists to the D.C. area, and many of them will be back open this weekend. The Smithsonian will reopen 10 of its museums on a staggered schedule throughout the summer, marking a full reopening of the institution since closing to the public in March 2020. The museums will maintain additional COVID-19 safety measures, and many require visitors to reserve free, timed-entry passes before arriving. According to Tourism Economics, visitor spending in the district fell more than $6 billion last year. That meant a loss of about $477 million in tax revenue from visitor spending.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: One of the world’s top electronic music festivals is returning to downtown Miami next year with the blessing of neighbors who have complained about the event in the past. Organizers of the Ultra Music Festival on Tuesday announced an agreement to settle tensions with the Downtown Neighbors Alliance, the Miami Herald reports. The association representing 13 downtown condominium towers will no longer seek to remove the event from Bayfront Park. Ultra said in a statement that it would address issues like construction schedules, park closures, noise monitoring and traffic management. Festival organizers and residents found a balance between protecting local lifestyles and hosting large-scale music productions, Ultra spokesman Ray Martinez said. He suggested the event being canceled the past two years might have helped negotiations. “Maybe the COVID pause gave both sides an opportunity to kind of take a breath, if you will, and come to the table without the impending event looming over either side,” Martinez said. Ultra was set to return to downtown Miami in March 2020, but a nationwide coronavirus lockdown going into effect just days before the festival forced its cancellation. The event was postponed for another year this past March, set to return in 2022.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Doctors are seeing an uptick in accidental overdoses in children in the area, said Dr. Brian Coleman, medical director of the pediatric emergency room at the Memorial Health Dwaine & Cynthia Willett Children’s Hospital of Savannah. Coleman said the children’s ER has seen about 15 cases since opening in March – roughly double the normal rate. Commonly ingested drugs are opioids and marijuana-infused foods. “It may be that with the pandemic, and people being in the house more, it just provides more opportunity for kids to explore,” he said. “And you know, kids are like little bloodhounds, and they will find stuff on the floor and under couches.” For some drugs, even “one pill can kill,” Coleman said, though none of the recent accidental overdoses resulted in a fatality. “A dose of a standard oxycodone or Percocet or any type of those opioid medications, one pill is enough to suppress the child’s breathing, suppress their mental status, to where it can be life-threatening,” he said. Sam Wilson, program coordinator of Safe Kids Savannah, urges parents, grandparents and other caregivers to keep all medications in child-proof packaging or a lock box and out of children’s reach. Wilson agreed the pandemic may have played a role in the increase by bringing together caregivers and kids in new settings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials are preparing to announce new incentives for people to get vaccinated. “It’s going to be big, and it’s going to be generous,” Lt. Gov. Josh Green said. “Probably about a week or two from now, I would expect some of these fun announcements to come.” While details are thin, Hawaii News Now reports officials with the Hawaii Restaurant Association and the Retail Merchants of Hawaii said they were asked to find businesses willing to participate. Green said he is also planning to try to get participation from Las Vegas, often referred to as Hawaii’s ninth island, to join. “My team is going to reach out to some hotels over in Las Vegas and see if they’d be willing to offer some nights over on the ninth island,” Green said. Hawaii has administered about 1.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Green said the state hopes to get about 2 million shots in arms. “So these last 500,000 doses are going to be a little bit more difficult,” he said. Department of Health spokesperson Brooks Baehr said members of the business community “are taking the lead in this effort to work with the Department of Health and provide incentives that may engage and excite people.” Several other states have already launched incentive programs. Green said Hawaii’s incentive program is being vetted by attorneys.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With the governor out of the state, Idaho’s lieutenant governor issued an executive order Thursday banning mask mandates in schools and public buildings, saying such directives threatened people’s freedom. Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin is acting governor while Gov. Brad Little is at the Republican Governors Association conference in Nashville, Tennessee. He was expected to return Thursday evening. Last week, McGeachin announced her run for governor, challenging the first-term incumbent Little. McGeachin is on the far right of the political spectrum in the conservative state, and her order could bolster her support as a candidate for governor. Little’s office said McGeachin did not make him aware that she planned to issue the executive order. The office didn’t say what Little would do when he returned but said residents value local control. “Throughout the pandemic, Gov. Little has been committed to protecting the health and safety of the people of Idaho and has emphasized the importance of Idahoans choosing to protect our neighbors and loved ones and keeping our economy and schools open,” said Little’s spokeswoman, Marissa Morrison. Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but some counties, cities and schools did. Many have been lifting the mandates.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: COVID-19 vaccines will be available to Memorial Day weekend travelers up and down Illinois. The state announced clinics at Union Station in Chicago and four TravelCenters of America locations in Mount Vernon, Troy, Effingham and Bloomington. Wally’s and Hy-Vee are also offering a clinic for travelers along Interstate 55 near Pontiac. Travelers will be offered the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In addition to the weekend clinics, more than 1,000 locations in Illinois offer COVID-19 vaccines. They’re listed at coronavirus.illinois.gov. “Memorial Day weekend travelers will have yet another chance to join the more than 6 million Illinoisans who have gotten vaccinated,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is directing all state employees to return to their offices by early July. Gov. Eric Holcomb told state workers that the transition from a March 2020 stay-at-home order starts with senior staff, who must return by June 7. Other employees should spend at least 50% of their time at the office by June 21 and return full time by July 6. Staffers for many state agencies have been working remotely, but Holcomb said in a Wednesday email to employees that “it is not the optimal way for us to serve Hoosiers.” “We work better together, and build more solid and collaborative teams, when we can have regular face-to-face conversations,” Holcomb said. “Returning to the office means the impromptu discussions that so often lead to innovation will be happening again with more frequency and energy.” The state will offer a vaccination clinic at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis on June 21-22. About 2.4 million Indiana residents were considered fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, although the state’s vaccination rate is the 14th lowest in the country at about 35% of total population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most of the state’s counties declined any more COVID-19 vaccine for this week amid a slack in demand, and an official in a county with one of the lowest vaccination rates said Wednesday that she has given up arguing with people to get shots. Iowa Department of Public Health officials said based on demand from counties, the state ordered just 7,850 doses of vaccine for this week, with 81 of its 99 counties ordering none at all. Only Johnson County in eastern Iowa reported more than half of its population fully vaccinated, at 53.2%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Polk County, the state’s most populous, has fully vaccinated 43.5% of the population. The three counties with the lowest vaccination rates are on the state’s southern border with Missouri, including Wayne County, with 29.7%. Wayne County Public Health Administrator Shelley Bickel said in the past she has tried to convince people to get vaccinated, but she’s stopped those attempts. “They’ll sit and argue with you. We’re just tired of fighting,” she said. “We’re not pushing anyone. We figure if you want it, you can get it.” She attributed resistance to conservative residents, many of whom have long declined to wear masks or get vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After a year of operating virtually because of the pandemic, the city’s Wheelhouse Incubator program is returning full force for a 2021 summer session. The Wheelhouse Incubator, hosted by GO Topeka, is a 12-week course designed to help entrepreneurs scale up their businesses through strategic education, networking and mentoring opportunities. “This spring/summer session will provide established entrepreneurs with the invaluable experiences and connections to take their business to the next level,” said Karen Christilles, the program’s director. According to Christilles, the program expects to enroll about a dozen business owners in the session. It’s expected to kick off June 14 and last through late August, with participants meeting from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. every other Monday. The cost of the program is $600 and can be spread out over multiple payments. Some scholarships are available, according to the program’s webpage. Topeka last held a Wheelhouse Incubator session in person in 2019 – the same year the program was introduced to the community through 712 Innovations.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: U of L Health announced Wednesday that it will require COVID-19 vaccines for all its workers by Sept.1, becoming the first major health care system in the state to declare it will make the shots mandatory. “We believe it’s time to step up and actually require the vaccine among all of our health care workers,” Tom Miller, CEO of U of L Health, said at a news briefing. Three U of L doctors and two nurses were the first in Kentucky to receive the vaccine when it arrived in December, and health officials said they have worked to make it accessible to employees as well as people throughout the community. LaShawn Scott was among the first five U of L Health workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “As a nurse, I think it’s important that we keep ourselves safe as we care for these patients and minimize the risk of transmission to our co-workers and our community,” she said at Wednesday’s briefing. Miller said he sees little difference in requiring a COVID-19 vaccine and an annual flu shot already required for U of L health workers. He said workers without a religious or medical exemption who refuse the vaccine would be subject to disciplinary action but didn’t specify the nature of any such action. U of L estimates more than 70% of its 12,000 workers have already been inoculated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: All-night alcohol sales are coming back, and a ban on parades is being lifted, as vaccination rates improve and as hospitalizations from COVID-19 stay low, the city announced Wednesday. Current rules require that alcoholic beverage sales end at 1 a.m. That changes under rules that take effect Friday, the city said in a news release. The latest changes mean more money-making opportunities for the tourist-dependent city that saw hotels, restaurants and bars hit hard during the pandemic. The city announced it will begin taking permit applications for large parades and smaller “second line” processions under the new rules. Parades are a vital part of many New Orleans celebrations, most notably during Mardi Gras season. Second lines, smaller processions so named because watchers often join the procession to form a second line behind the band, take place year-round – a familiar scene after weddings, funerals or other events. The city is also allowing gyms to operate at full capacity and removing 6-foot table spacing requirements at restaurants. There remain some restrictions on the number of people allowed at large gatherings. But exceptions are to be made for events where masks are required or where participants provide proof of vaccinations.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials are not planning to develop a statewide vaccine passport system for recipients of COVID-19 shots. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said such a system would be a challenge because of questions such as how it would work across state lines and how the state would protect residents’ privacy. She said Wednesday that Maine isn’t looking to create one. The state supports private businesses that want to request COVID-19 vaccine verification, Lambrew said. She said businesses should make sure any verification systems they use are in line with state laws. “At this time there are no state of Maine policies that would have one set of rules for people who are vaccinated and another for those who are not,” Lambrew said. Residents who travel this summer are encouraged to bring their immunization record card if they need it, as well as a mask, Lambrew said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore City Schools won’t require tens of thousands of students failing classes this year amid challenges posed by the pandemic to repeat a grade in the fall. Instead, Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said, schools will give students additional time and customized instruction plans to make up gaps. News outlets report the decision was announced at a school board meeting Tuesday night and in emails to parents and teachers. No school board vote is required. About 65% of secondary students and 50% of elementary students in the system are failing at least one class, according to the school system. Testing will determine what students have missed, and a catch-up plan will be developed. The grading system is also being changed. Elementary students with an “unsatisfactory” grade in a course and middle school students with a failing grade will get a “not completed.” High school students with a failing grade will get a “no credit.” Dabrowksi told the school board that officials want to signal “a hopeful space for our young people and our commitment as educators to wrap around them when we bring them back.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A memorial flag garden on the Boston Common that honors every service member from Massachusetts who has died in war is back in its full glory this year. Fully vaccinated health care workers, military members and other volunteers gathered on the Common on Wednesday to plant 37,000 small U.S. flags, each one representing a fallen service member dating to the Revolutionary War. Last year the flag garden was set up on a limited basis, with about 1,000 flags placed 6 feet apart because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The flag garden, now in its 12th year, is organized by the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund and Home Base, a partnership of the Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital that supports veterans. Meanwhile, the state’s casinos and slots parlors will be able to welcome gamblers under nearly pre-pandemic conditions beginning this weekend. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to end its COVID-19 restrictions. That means beginning Saturday, every slot machine and gaming table will be allowed to reopen. Visitors who have been fully vaccinated won’t have to wear a mask. The move comes as Gov. Charlie Baker has ordered all remaining COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted Saturday. The state’s face covering order will also be rescinded for most settings.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s reelection campaign – not a nonprofit fund – will pay for her flights to and from Florida, where she visited her ailing father in March. The disclosure Thursday came in a letter to a Republican lawmaker who had asked questions about the pandemic trip. A lawyer for the governor’s campaign and the fund said he learned from Detroit-based PVS Chemicals, which supplied the private jet, that it could not accept the $27,521 payment except from a candidate committee because it is not authorized to operate charter flights. In a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Steve Johnson, Christopher Trebilcock said PVS and the fund, Michigan Transition 2019, learned of a “miscommunication” between themselves over the source of payment due to media reports. He said Whitmer flew private, instead of commercial, for security reasons – citing death threats and noting an alleged plot to kidnap her over her COVID-19 restrictions. Her state security detail accompanied her. Their expenses will be covered by the campaign, lessening the burden on taxpayers, he said. “But for her elected office, the governor would not have incurred the security expenses for travel to see her ailing father on short notice,” Trebilcock said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz hopes giveaways including Minnesota State Fair tickets, fishing licenses and state park passes will help pick up the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations, which has slowed. The Democratic governor on Thursday announced that 100,000 people who are vaccinated between Memorial Day weekend and the end of June will be eligible to choose among nine vaccine reward options. The incentives also include college baseball tickets, amusement park passes and a $25 Visa card, among other options. Walz called the incentive program a “wonderful opportunity” to vaccinate more residents while coronavirus case numbers remain low and as more people head outdoors this summer. “All of those things are the perfect timing to get the last bunch of folks to get in and get vaccinated,” Walz said during a news conference Thursday. “Take advantage of the incentives that we’re offering, and get out and explore Minnesota. You, your family and your community will be safe, and you’ll get to see the great things that we have.” COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in recent weeks after a bump in cases last month driven by virus variants. State health officials reported zero deaths earlier this week for the third time this month, and daily deaths haven’t totaled more than 22 in months.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s second-largest school district is planning on 100% in-person learning during the coming academic year, after having classes online for more than half of the current school year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Jackson Public Schools Superintendent Errick Greene said some students had a harder time learning from home. “Our early learners require more individualized instruction that’s just really difficult to provide virtually,” Greene told WJTV. “Some of our scholars faced serious behavioral, social and emotional challenges due to the long periods of isolation.” To enter any building, people will still have their temperatures taken, and they must wear masks. Sports are expected to pick back up, but the Jackson schools will require each person at indoor events to wear a mask. “I want to see all sports come back,” said Cameron Frank, an upcoming junior at Forest Hill High School. “Football, basketball, everything else for that matter.” Isolation rooms will be set up for any students who arrive with COVID-19 symptoms or get sick during the day. The district has enough laptops to give one to each student if they catch the disease. Classrooms and school buses will also go through deep cleanings daily.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city announced Thursday that Mayor Ken McClure intended to withdraw the civil emergency declaration undergirding Springfield’s COVID-19 health regulations, such as occupancy restrictions and a public masking mandate. The city said in a news release that the withdrawal would be effective at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, just ahead of the 12:01 a.m. Friday effective date for the repeal of the ordinance containing the city’s coronavirus regulations. Missouri’s other larger communities, including Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, already dropped their mask mandates when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued more lenient guidance on masking for vaccinated people earlier this month. “I am very proud of our community and grateful that there no longer appears to exist a state of civil emergency,” McClure said in a statement. “We would not be at this point had it not been for our community’s brave, innovative and critical work in the battle against COVID-19. It has not been easy. Thank you.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A local massage therapist recently expanded her business, a move that has freed her up to do something she’s always wanted to do: give back. Olga Hall said she’ll begin scheduling free sessions. And because it’s been a rough pandemic, she’s starting with medical professionals. Once summer hits, she’d like to schedule some teachers, followed by law enforcement, firefighters and child care workers. Hall said her philosophy is that people should not be preoccupied by their pain. So far, Hall has brought on two therapists to Massage Therapy Studios. She’s starting her free massages slowly to avoid overloading them and herself. At first, Hall will have four 30-minute slots. Clients can sign themselves up or nominate someone else starting May 31. At the end of the week, Hall will choose four names and reach out to make appointments for the week of June 14. Sign-ups are online only at massagetherapystudios.com. The site will go live May 31. Those who are chosen can up their session to an hour for an extra $25, and there will be a waiting list in case of cancellations. Four people a month doesn’t seem like much, but Hall said she would like to increase that number once she knows what her staff can handle.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is reporting its lowest level of new coronavirus cases since last April, shortly after the pandemic began. State health officials said 521 virus cases were reported over the past week, which was down from the previous week’s 533 cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases also decreased over the past two weeks from 195.43 per day May 11 to 74.43 per day Tuesday. The state said there have now been 223,243 cases and 2,249 deaths linked to the virus in Nebraska since the pandemic began. Over the past week, five new deaths were reported. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Nebraska also remains low at 73. Across Nebraska, 807,878 people, or roughly 42% of the state’s population, have been vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: For the second month in a row, the state’s casinos reported $1 billion in house winnings in April, showing signs that tourism business is returning faster to pre-pandemic levels than some experts expected. The state Gaming Control Board said Thursday that last month’s overall “casino win” of nearly $1.04 billion was up a robust 11% compared with $936 million in April 2019. A comparison with a year ago wasn’t relevant because casinos statewide were closed from mid-March to early June 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Before those closures, casinos had taken in more than $1 billion for three consecutive months. They reached the $1 billion mark again this March. Michael Lawton, senior analyst for the regulatory board, said winnings ticked up slightly in April at properties in the key Las Vegas Strip resort corridor, while casinos in downtown Las Vegas and the remainder of Clark County tallied all-time record winnings for consecutive months. The Reno area recorded its highest casino winnings total since July 2008, and sports bet winnings statewide also set records in April, Lawton said. The state collected more than $79 million in revenue based on the April numbers, up from about $19,000 in April 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: All state-managed COVID-19 vaccination sites will be closing at the end of June, officials said Thursday. The sites will be closed Monday for Memorial Day. They will reopen Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and operate Mondays through Saturdays, only providing second-dose vaccinations, health officials said in a news release Thursday. Those sites will close June 30. “There are more than 350 locations across the state offering first-dose appointments and many locations offer walk-in service without the need for an appointment,” the news release said. Meanwhile, Nashua officials have approved ending the city’s mask ordinance. The Board of Aldermen opted to end the ordinance Tuesday, and it awaited a signature from Mayor Jim Donchess, The Telegraph of Nashua reports. Local businesses could still require workers and patrons to wear masks. The city’s Board of Health voted to recommend that the city lift its mask mandate. The city has had an ordinance in place since May 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Mask mandates may be waived at high schools sooner than elementary and middle schools in the fall because teens have a head start over younger kids on getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. A day after he said all students will likely be required to wear a mask come September, Murphy suggested Wednesday that mask rules for schools and even summer camps are more fluid as coronavirus numbers continue to drop, and federal guidance may change. “If the science suggested it, you can turn your mask guidance on a dime because it’s easy,” Murphy said at a briefing. “You just don’t wear this the next day. So stay tuned.” The remarks came with New Jersey on the cusp of lifting its indoor mask mandate Friday. One major exception is anywhere unvaccinated children congregate in large groups, such as schools, day care centers and camps. Because those 12 and older are eligible to be vaccinated, it would make sense to allow high school students to go maskless in the fall when full in-class instruction resumes, Murphy said. About 202,000 children ages 12 to 17 had been vaccinated in New Jersey as of Wednesday, according to state Health Department data.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces has announced its intent to resume regular Mass, including Sunday Eucharist, and reinstate the church’s general obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass. Services have been disrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. A dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been in place since public health orders and capacity restrictions drove parishioners to celebrate Mass online and in church parking lots. A revised public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in April allowed houses of worship to welcome congregations back at 100% capacity. The move followed U.S. Supreme Court decisions that enjoin states from enforcing capacity limits on churches that are more restrictive than other entities like factories and schools, the governor’s office said at the time. In a memo issued Tuesday, Bishop Peter Baldacchino said the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass will take effect Sunday, June 6. However, exceptions to the obligation remain in place for anyone who is sick or symptomatic or has recently been exposed to the coronavirus and for anyone with significant health risk factors or those caring for someone with such risk factors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the state Department of Labor will provide guidance to businesses that taking time off due to side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine shot will be covered under New York’s paid sick leave law. Cuomo said studies have shown some people have been leery of getting a shot because it could require them to take time off from work to recuperate. A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation among unvaccinated Americans showed 48% are concerned they “might need to miss work if the side effects of the vaccine make them feel sick for a day or more.” But he said the state will make sure that any sick time due to recovery from any vaccine will be paid time off. A news release from Cuomo’s office said workers could take “any necessary recovery period” to get back on their feet after their vaccines. During a news conference at Grand Central Terminal, he also noted that New York already has a regulation on the books, enacted as part of this year’s state budget, that requires employers to give workers four hours of time off to get a vaccine shot, one for each dose if needed. “I don’t want to suggest that there are side effects,” Cuomo said of the vaccine. “If that’s an issue for you, that issue is resolved. You won’t miss a day’s pay because of getting a vaccine.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House unanimously approved legislation Wednesday that aims to spend $750 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to install high-speed internet in rural and remote areas lacking it. The legislation would set aside $350 million in discretionary American Rescue Plan funds earmarked for North Carolina to expand a relatively new state broadband installation matching-funds program with internet providers and electric cooperatives. The bill also expresses the intent to use $400 million in the funds from Congress on a new program that gives counties the ability to put out bids for broadband expansion in underserved areas. Federal aid going to counties also would pay for those projects. The measure, which now goes to the Senate, meets goals of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in his proposal last week to spend $1.2 billion of money from the latest pandemic aid package on improving internet access. But his plan spends half of that money on things like subsidizing service costs, purchasing computer equipment for households lacking it and offering “digital literacy” training. Some Democrats said during floor debate that they wished Wednesday’s bill contained the service subsidies. Still, the legislation passed 109-0.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Corrections officials will ease some coronavirus visitation restrictions in state prisons next week. In-person prison visits had been limited to one adult since they resumed in late March. Beginning Tuesday, visitors will be allowed to bring up to three minors per visit. Visitors must test negative for the virus, and advance scheduling is still required. Visitors 6 years and older must still wear a mask, but it doesn’t have to be an N95 mask, as is required now. The changes come as the number of active coronavirus cases is decreasing in the state along with a slight increase in COVID-19 vaccinations, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The state Health Department confirmed 79 new cases from 2,043 tests completed Monday. No new deaths were reported Tuesday, for a fifth straight day. Forty-two virus patients remained hospitalized, up one from Monday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s tracking site shows North Dakota’s rate of total vaccine doses administered, at 79,438 people per 100,000 population, ranks 33rd in the nation among states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota had earlier been one of the top states. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has reported that the state has some of the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy in the nation.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After more than 10 months, the state will no longer produce a weekly county map to show how the coronavirus is spreading in all 88 counties. The map was intended as a warning system for communities and has served its purpose, Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud said. “We’re in a very different point in this pandemic, and the need for this kind of urgency has passed,” McCloud told reporters Thursday afternoon. The Ohio Public Health Advisory System was rolled out in early July by Gov. Mike DeWine as a tool to help Ohioans make decisions about events and activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The map shaded each county based on seven metrics, including the number of new cases per 100,000 residents and an increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms. The lowest level, yellow, meant “active exposure and spread” of the virus. The highest level, purple, indicated “severe exposure and spread.” Each color came with suggestions such as to “limit activities as much as possible.” But there were no state policies or mandates tied to a color. Some school districts, businesses and other organizations used the map to determine when to allow in-person contact. The map lost some of its usefulness as infections surged in November and December.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Fifty-two people got COVID-19 shots Wednesday outside a Feria Latina Supermarket – a location selected by the Oklahoma City-County Health Department for a pop-up clinic by monitoring several data trends. The store’s ZIP code lagged others in vaccination rates, and sewage surveillance showed the coronavirus was present at higher levels in the area compared with other parts of the county. Coupled with lower vaccine uptake among Hispanic residents, those reasons led health officials to land on the grocery store for a pop-up site. As of Tuesday, about 19% of Hispanic residents in Oklahoma County were fully vaccinated, and 24% had received a first dose. The Oklahoma City-County Health Department has taken COVID-19 vaccines on the road in an effort to bring the shots to those who might not otherwise seek one out or be able to get to a vaccine clinic. At the site Wednesday, some people going to pick up groceries took a detour to get their vaccines on their way in or out, said health department spokeswoman Molly Fleming. They had their pick of whichever shot they’d like: Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. The Feria Latina site saw a steady pace of vaccine-takers and was one of the department’s most successful pop-up clinics so far, Fleming said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Employment Department says in July it will start upgrading the obsolete computer system that pays jobless benefits. That would end a 12-year delay that caused a catastrophic breakdown in distributing aid during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The state’s new system won’t be in place until 2024. Oregon was among the slowest states in the nation at paying jobless benefits amid the pandemic, with laid-off workers frequently waiting weeks or months for aid. The employment department was hindered by a rigid computer system from the 1990s, which was unable to adapt to supplemental benefits Congress added last year. The huge volume of claims – Oregon has paid out more than $9 billion during the pandemic – meant months of delays. The state received $86 million in federal aid to upgrade its technology in 2009, but administrative failures in the employment department stopped the work from happening. The state still has almost all the money the federal government allocated for the upgrade. Past estimates have put the total cost for the project between $80 million and $123 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is lifting its mask mandate no later than June 28. The Department of Health announced Thursday that it will no longer require unvaccinated people to wear masks in public June 28 or once 70% of adults are fully vaccinated, whichever comes first. People are considered fully vaccinated once they are two weeks beyond their last required dose of COVID-19 vaccine. According to federal data, 70% of Pennsylvania residents 18 and over have already received at least one dose, with just over half the adult population fully inoculated. “What all of this means is that Pennsylvanians are realizing that they have the power to stop COVID-19 and that they are stepping up to get vaccinated. It also means that we are on track to get to 70% of all adults with second doses by the end of June,” Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said at a news conference Thursday. Businesses, schools and municipalities may still require people to wear masks, the Health Department said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also requires them on planes, trains, buses and public transportation hubs. With the pandemic in retreat, the state previously announced plans to lift nearly all mitigation orders on Memorial Day. New infections continue to fall rapidly.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The city has planted a living memorial to the almost 200 residents who have died after contracting the coronavirus. A tree and accompanying plaque were dedicated Monday outside city hall, WPRI-TV reports. “This tree will remain here for generations to come as a reminder of loved ones that are no longer with us,” Mayor Bob DaSilva said. The tree will be decorated during the holidays every year in their honor, he said. The plaque reads: “In memory of East Providence residents whose lives were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. May they rest in eternal peace.” The Rhode Island Department of Health on Thursday reported nearly 80 new confirmed cases but no virus-related deaths. The new cases were out of slightly more than 8,000 test results returned the prior day, for a positivity rate of less than 1%. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped to 65, according to the latest data, down from 70 the previous day. The number of people fully vaccinated against the disease in the state has now topped 544,000. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island has dropped over the past two weeks, from about 151 on May 11 to about 120 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are working to roll out pop-up vaccination clinics at beaches and festivals this summer, said Dr. Brannon Traxler, the state’s director of public health. One program would bring vaccine clinics to state parks, where people would get a free shot and park admission for the day, she said. Another plan is to partner with breweries to offer free beer for people who get a shot, Traxler said. The incentive effort is based on the success of similar programs in other states that have reached young people, one demographic that is lagging on inoculations. While there has been significant progress, COVID-19 remains a threat to people who have not been vaccinated, Traxler said. Indoor events including churches and movie theaters with lots of people are among the riskiest activities for those who have not been vaccinated while being safe for those who have, she said. For parents of children under 12, who are not eligible for the vaccination, going to places like that poses individual risks that are best assessed by each family, Traxler said. South Carolina has one of the lower vaccination rates in the nation. Only eight states, primarily in the Southeast, have lower rates. The nation recently passed 50% of adults having at least one COVID-19 shot. South Carolina’s rate is 44%.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Following suit with public schools and universities, officials with the city’s private schools and universities also don’t plan on mandating COVID-19 vaccines for students and staff when they return to classrooms this fall. Augustana University won’t require vaccinations for staff or students, said Suzie O’Meara Hernes, COVID-19 response coordinator for the school. The vaccine is a personal choice, Hernes said. However, in some cases, students will be required to get COVID-19 shots, such as a nursing student who is required by the hospital system for which they work in their clinical placement. Of the Augie community, staff and students, 64% have reported they’re fully vaccinated, Hernes said. Vaccine reporting is voluntary and relies on the individual to report, she noted, adding she believes the percentage is higher than reported. At the University of Sioux Falls, the university doesn’t require vaccines and won’t plan to this fall. USF was “blessed” to remain open for the duration of the 2020-21 academic year and is working toward a full “return to normal” for this fall, said Amy Johnson, USF COVID-19 response team leader. At the K-12 level, officials with Sioux Falls Christian Schools and Bishop O’Gorman Catholic Schools both say they’re not planning to require COVID-19 shots either.\n\nTennessee\n\nMaryville: A woman accused of driving through a COVID-19 vaccine distribution tent as a form of protest has been charged with seven counts of felony reckless endangerment, according to a police report. Virginia Christine Lewis Brown, 36, was arrested after a Blount County deputy witnessed her driving through the tent at a vaccine event Monday at Foothills Mall in Maryville, according to news outlets, which cited an incident report. The report said more than a dozen health department and National Guard personnel were inside the tent. “I had several victims tell me she almost hit them as she fled through the tent at high speeds,” the deputy wrote in the report. “I was advised that they were within inches and feet of the vehicle as it came through the tent. Several victims stated that they thought the driver was going to kill them.” After the deputy stopped Brown, she told him she drove through the site to protest the vaccine and was only traveling 5 miles per hour, the report said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Brown had an attorney.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Several nursing students are objecting to a policy at Driscoll Children’s Hospital requiring them to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to complete their clinical rotations. Severe reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have been rare; clinical trials have yielded efficacy results beyond what some medical professionals expected; and the mRNA technology used to make the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines has been decades in the making. Yet misinformation and distrust continue to surround the new vaccines, even within the health care field. Most of the students objecting to the requirement said they’re averse to getting a COVID-19 shot because the vaccines so far do not have full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA. One student said she contracted COVID-19 and tested positive for antibodies, suggesting that meant she didn’t need the vaccine. Experts have recommended that people who recovered from COVID-19 be vaccinated because it’s unclear how long immunity from a previous infection lasts. The students also say vaccine requirements run afoul of an order by Gov. Greg Abbott banning entities that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination under an emergency use authorization.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As the nation inches toward its vaccination goals, “COVID cabin fever” is beginning to lift. But for tourist-based communities like southern Utah, which before the pandemic was expecting its busiest season yet, “post-COVID is a whole world that is just as mysterious as early COVID was,” Washington County Commissioner Gil Almquist said. The effects of overtourism have also returned. Park officials have reported unprecedented levels of vandalism and human waste in Arches and Zion National Parks. Scenes showing long lines of idling traffic clogging up roadways have become commonplace. Officials and advocates statewide have long seen overtourism as a real threat, but the bustling summer crowds brought on by the pandemic have sent them scrambling to figure out ways to manage it while still supporting the locals who depend on tourism dollars. Of the five Utah national parks, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Arches National Parks all had their highest-ever visitation levels in 2018. Canyonlands National Park made its record in 2016, and Zion National Park, the third most visited park in the country, hit a peak of 4.5 million visitors in 2017. Utah Office of Tourism Director Vicki Varella said travel this summer will mimic trends seen before the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: All of Vermont’s state parks will be open for Memorial Day weekend. Some opened in the beginning of May, but by Friday, all 55 will be open, WCAX-TV reports. Following a surge in visitors last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, park officials expect to have one of the busiest seasons ever, said state parks director Nate McKeen. “People understand being outside is one of the safest places to be, and it’s the best place possible for your mental and physical health, and then they get out and see our state parks,” he said. While many campsites are full, and others are going quickly, visiting a state park for the day is also an option, said Vermont Forestry Commissioner Michael Snyder. Day visits make up half of the usage of Vermont State Parks. “We kind of like to think of our parks as everyone’s lake house, remote camp. You don’t have the property taxes, you don’t have to maintain them, you pay a small fee, and you are good to go,” McKeen said.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: The city reported the highest unemployment rate in the state, according to a new equity dashboard from Virginia’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Petersburg’s 14.9% jobless rate in January 2021 was nearly three times the average across Virginia. And it was 4 percentage points higher than second-worst Emporia’s 10.9%. “If you are unemployed, and you don’t have financial resources, then it makes all of those social determinants of health that much more complicated,” said Janice Underwood, chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer for the commonwealth. Unemployment skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic as millions of workers were laid off or furloughed as a result of state-mandated closures. Virginia’s highest statewide unemployment rate in the past 14 months was 11% in April 2020. Fortunately, the state has been in decline, ranking at a rate of 5.7% in January. Following the declaration of racism as a public health crisis, the state embarked on creating two dashboards to provide information in hopes of addressing the various health disparities. The Equity-in-Action dashboard reflects the progress the state has made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the Equity-at-a-Glance dashboard focuses on various social disparities, like food distribution and Medicaid.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city is shutting down all but one of its mass COVID-19 vaccination sites next month because authorities say more than 76% of Seattle residents eligible have received at least one shot, and 60% are fully vaccinated. Authorities announced Wednesday that the city-run sites at Lumen Field, Rainier Beach, West Seattle and North Seattle College will close in June. The Seattle Times reports the Seattle Fire Department will continue operating its testing and vaccination site in the SODO neighborhood south of downtown through the summer. “Now that the vast majority of Seattleites have begun the vaccination process, we are able to safely reopen and recover as a city – without the need for our fixed sites,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement. The city’s vaccination efforts got a boost when the Lumen Field Event Center opened more than two months ago. Since March 13, more than 97,000 vaccinations have been administered at the event center near two of the city’s large sports arenas. The city says it will continue to offer mobile vaccinations and spin up vaccination clinics as needed. Seattle is outpacing the state with COVID-19 vaccinations. The state Department of Health’s data dashboard shows nearly 61% of residents 16 and older have gotten at least one shot, and more than 40% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office has reopened after being closed for more than a year because of the pandemic. Walk-up services now available to the public include certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said. The office, located in the Diamond building, is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. People who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are required to wear masks. Certificates are $12 each. Exact change is required if paying in cash, or customers may use a money order or check. Credit and debit cards are not accepted. The Vital Registration Office and Diamond building lobby closed to the public March 20, 2020, as the coronavirus began to spread widely in the United States.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of COVID-19 deaths in the state has now surpassed 7,000, but data that shows the number of coronavirus cases declining and more people being vaccinated offer some hope after more than a year of the pandemic. The state Department of Health on Wednesday reported five new deaths and 330 new cases of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of 7,003 people in Wisconsin. The average number of daily new cases over the past seven days is 307. A week ago the average was 394 daily cases. As coronavirus cases in Wisconsin continue to decline, more residents are being vaccinated against COVID-19. A total of 5,087,871 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state as of Wednesday, with nearly 79% of Wisconsinites ages 65 and older having been fully vaccinated. About 16% of the state’s 12- to 15-year-olds have received their first doses of vaccine, according to health officials. That age group became eligible May 13.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to return to full capacity for home football games inside War Memorial Stadium this fall. University of Wyoming Athletic Director Tom Burman told the Casper Star-Tribune that fans, including students, won’t be required to be vaccinated in order to attend games. “It puts a smile on my face. It’s not just about money. It’s about the experience,” Burman said. “I watched the PGA Championship the other day, and I watched people following Phil (Mickelson), and I thought, ‘That’s what it’s all about.’ If we don’t return to that, I worry about the future of our sports. It’s not as appealing when there aren’t fans there.” Last season was shortened because of the coronavirus pandemic, and home attendance was initially capped at 7,000, then further reduced to 5,000, or 17% of the 29,181-seat stadium’s capacity. University officials worked with the state Department of Health to determine attendance figures based on the virus’s local impact at that time. The attendance plan for the fall could change depending on the data between now and the start of the upcoming season in September, Burman said, adding that he does not expect that to be the case.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/us/five-things-january-4-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Jan. 4: Elizabeth Holmes, Covid, Congress ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The US is back at a point where more than 2,000 people are dying of Covid-19 every day on average, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Additionally, about 12,000 to 50,000 Americans lose their lives to flu every year. The best way to avoid another devastating season, doctors say, is to get vaccinated for both. Meanwhile, parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, are coming out of long lockdowns and abandoning their “zero Covid” strategies. Leaders want to revive their countries’ economies, especially their tourism sectors, but experts are worried that low vaccination rates in the region could spell disaster.\n\n2. United Nations\n\nHospitals across the US are bracing for a wave of young coronavirus patients following the holidays. The FDA yesterday expanded booster eligibility to children ages 12 to 15, a move aimed at combating the rapid spread of the Omicron and Delta variants spurred by holiday travel. The agency also said children 12 and older now only need to wait five months before receiving a booster shot after completing their first series of vaccines. Experts are stressing vaccinations for children are critical now more than ever because Omicron causes more upper airway problems that make it more dangerous for children than adults. One pediatric hospital in Houston, for example, reported a four-fold increase in child hospitalizations over the past two weeks, with more than 700 children hospitalized due to the Omicron variant.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Largest pediatric hospital sees 4x increase in hospitalizations 03:43 - Source: CNN\n\nThe climate crisis was front and center at the UN General Assembly yesterday. Chinese President Xi Jinping recorded a rare address to the UN body promising to halt coal projects, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country will present the Paris climate agreement to its parliament next month, and US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stressed further climate action during an Oval Office meeting. An array of international points of conflict were also addressed by the dozens of world leaders present, including nuclear arms in Iran, free and fair elections in Venezuela, and competition between the US and China. The Taliban have also requested representation at this week’s meeting, a move that is expected to kick off a diplomatic battle with the preexisting Afghan envoy.\n\n3. Congress\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has announced the chamber will take a vote on whether to change the Senate’s legislative filibuster rules. The filibuster is a common delaying tactic meant to drag out debate and make it harder to get things done. In recent months, Democrats have discussed various changes to the filibuster rule to avoid stalling legislative decisions on key issues like voting rights and the debt ceiling. Schumer has said the tactic has become weaponized in the Senate, and the body must evolve to be more efficient. However, any major changes are unlikely to pass due to widespread resistance from Republicans and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Schumer says he is hoping for a vote by January 17.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pelosi on filibuster carveout: Voting rights is 'fundamental' 02:16 - Source: CNN\n\nProgressive Democrats have announced they will not vote for the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill without passing the $3.5 trillion package that is aimed at enacting President Joe Biden’s economic agenda. That vote is scheduled for next week, and as it stands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a handful of votes to get anything passed. President Biden will increase his engagement with Congressional Democrats today, including a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to try and get all the Democratic factions in line. Yesterday, the House also passed a bill to avoid a government shutdown and suspend the US debt limit. The bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, so the country is still approaching a possible shutdown and financial precipice in the coming weeks.\n\n4. Trump revelations\n\nAbortion providers are returning to the Supreme Court for a long-shot bid to challenge the controversial Texas abortion law that went into effect about four months ago. Last month, the high court allowed the law to stand and returned the case to a conservative federal appeals court. It was a blow to abortion rights activists, and now providers have asked the Supreme Court to require the appeals court to send the case back to a district court judge who had previously ruled in their favor. In its decision last month, the Supreme Court did say providers could sue to keep local officials from enforcing the law. However, the Texas law, which heavily restricts abortion and allows private citizens to seek legal action against anyone who violates it, is seen as a major threat to abortion rights that could affect national legal precedent.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Supreme Court upholds TX abortion law, but says providers can sue 02:28 - Source: CNN\n\nSeveral recent revelations have shed light on then-President Trump and his supporters’ plans to subvert the Constitution and keep him in power after the 2020 election. These revelations are likely to be of high interest to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. For instance, a newly revealed memo shows a conservative lawyer working with Trump’s legal team tried to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could overturn the election results on January 6 when Congress counted the Electoral College votes. The six-step scheme, which included throwing out electors from seven states, was outlined in a two-page memo obtained by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa for their book, “Peril.” The memo was then obtained by CNN.\n\n5. Immigration\n\nA 2009 settlement agreement between sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and one of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, as been unsealed as part of Giuffre’s separate lawsuit against Prince Andrew. The document shows Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault. Attorneys for Prince Andrew have argued that Guiffre’s case against him should be dismissed because it violates the terms of the settlement agreement with Epstein, in which she agreed to a “general release” of claims against Epstein and other parties, who are not specified. Guiffre is suing Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second-oldest son, alleging she was forced to perform sex acts with him while she was underage. According to Guiffre, Andrew knew she was a minor at the time. Oral arguments in the civil suit are set to begin today.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Prince Andrew accuser's settlement with Jeffrey Epstein released 06:14 - Source: CNN\n\nThere are about 8,600 Haitian migrants remaining under the Del Rio International bridge in Texas, waiting to be processed by immigration officials and possibly removed from the country. That’s down from a high of about 14,000 earlier in the week, but there are still tens of thousands of other Haitian refugees further south, still waiting for a chance to enter the US. There are up to 30,000 Haitians in Colombia who may be seeking to travel north, and Panama expects 80,000 migrants to cross its borders by the end of this year. South and Central American leaders have expressed concern at the unprecedented flow of migrants. More than 97% of Haitians migrating to the US do not come directly from Haiti, but rather were residents of other countries first. Many Haitians trying to enter the US are believed to have been living elsewhere since the devastating Haiti earthquake in 2010.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\n‘Dancing with the Stars’ Season 30 premieres\n\nThere may not be any flying cars (yet), but there’s a space plane and that’s pretty close.\n\nPeople are jokingly calling the Omicron variant ‘Omarion,” and the singer is taking it in stride\n\n“If you just so happen to run into me on the street, you don’t have to isolate for five days,” he said. “Nor do you have to have a negative test result to dance to my music.”\n\nMercedes unveils new electric car concept with parts made of sustainable materials like mushroom fibers, ground up cacti and food scraps.\n\nFinally, a car with a flavor profile!\n\nSnow forecast: See how much snow is expected in your area with these maps\n\nWarning: May cause sudden weather-related anxiety.\n\nSweetgreen, a fancy salad chain, is selling a salad subscription\n\nFancy salads are an important part of the “new year, new me” fantasy, so the timing here is impeccable.\n\nTwo days after lighting the cauldron at the Opening Ceremony, tennis star Naomi Osaka handily won her first match on Sunday.

I wanted to run… down the block and just scream. I can’t escape my body. I can’t escape what I feel.”\n\nAlong with Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter also died in the crash, Bryant filed a federal civil lawsuit alleging Los Angeles County invaded their privacy and inflicted emotional distress by not properly containing the spread of the photos which, according to witness testimony, show not just helicopter wreckage but the mangled bodies of the victims.\n\nBryant admitted to being nervous on the stand and cried when talking about her late daughter Gianna. She had to gather herself when describing the day it took to find Gianna’s body in the wreckage. She sobbed as she recalled looking at a secure NTSB website to identify clothing and other personal items of the victims.\n\nBryant recounted her interaction after the crash with Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who informed her that her husband and daughter had been killed. She broke down at times when recalling the events.\n\n“I’m sorry Mrs. Bryant. Is there anything I can do for you?” Bryant recalled Villanueva asking.\n\n“If you can’t bring my babies back, then please secure the area. I’m concerned about paparazzi,” she recalled telling him.\n\nThe sheriff assured her that he would, but he remained in the room, Bryant said. She urged him to leave and to handle her request immediately.\n\nAccording to Bryant, Villanueva stepped out and returned, telling her he had secured a temporary flight restriction over the area through the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nBryant testified that she had to remove comments from her Instagram feed after the images were distributed. Her attorney Luis Li displayed a comment sent to her shortly after the LA Times story published.\n\n“Ima leak Kobe’s body,” said the message, which included helicopter and fire emojis.\n\nDefense attorneys, in court filings, have indicated they plan to address Bryant’s own Instagram posts, including one from Halloween in which she is dressed as Cruella de Vil, a villain depicted in Disney movies.\n\n“They say there are five stages of grief: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Well, I’d like to add one more…revenge. – Cruella,” the caption reads.\n\nLi asked Bryant about the post. She testified that the choice of costume was consistent with other Halloween outfits she has worn, including the Wicked Witch from “The Wizard of Oz” and Darth Vader.\n\nBryant said she dresses up as the bad characters to allow her girls to be the good ones.\n\nSheriff testifies he devised a ‘bargain’ to ensure photos were deleted\n\nDuring cross examination, the defense sought to show that Bryant had other sources of stress beyond the photo controversy, including a lawsuit filed against her by her mother. Bryant testified that her mother “thought she was entitled to money.”\n\nDefense attorney Mira Hashmall told Bryant that her mother “accused you of fraud… elder abuse, that must have been stressful.”\n\n“It was definitely hurtful,” Bryant said, adding that she also felt betrayed.\n\n“I’m sure that was stressful,” Hashmall asked.\n\n“Yeah, it wasn’t easy,” Bryant replied, adding that the lawsuit was settled and it didn’t cause the kind of lasting fear she has of the crash scene photos surfacing.\n\n“That was a stress at the time, but my mother gave birth to me. She raised me. And like I said, it has been resolved,” Bryant said of the lawsuit.\n\nThe defense pressed Bryant on whether her goal was for the photos to never be seen – which the LA County claims its actions accomplished.\n\n“I would have wanted someone to recover all the photographs and investigate” who shared what, Bryant said.\n\nThe first witness for the defense, Sheriff Villanueva, testified about the need for expediency in handling the leaked photos. He said that opening a formal investigation would invoke union legal rules that could involve attorneys and delays and allow more opportunity for the photos to spread.\n\n“There’s one way we’re going to get them immediately,” Villanueva said, referring to the crash scene, so he devised what he called a “bargain.”\n\nThe deputies involved in the leak would prove the photos were deleted and get a note about their conduct in a performance log, Villanueva testified.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs sought to show that the handling of the episode limited internal affairs from later conducting an investigation into alleged wrongdoing.\n\n“You can’t have the accountability and (also) risk the photos getting out,” Villanueva testified. “And we picked the right one.”\n\nBryant had earlier testified that she lives in fear because a formal investigation could not confirm all crash site photos were accounted for and destroyed.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel described how they shared photos\n\nThe trial has so far seen testimony by several law enforcement personnel, including a deputy who testified he showed graphic images from the scene while at a bar, another deputy who said he shared photos while playing a video game, a deputy who sent dozens of photos to someone he didn’t know, and a fire official who showed the images to other personnel during an awards ceremony cocktail hour.\n\nChester, who along with Bryant filed the suit, testified on Thursday, saying he lives in fear that the graphic photos taken of his loved ones’ bodies may resurface one day.\n\nChester took the stand after several days of testimony from the law enforcement officials – some of whom offered apologies, detailed the graphic nature of the photos, and explained why they were taken and shared and why orders were given to delete them.\n\nBryant has been in the courtroom listening to the testimony of every witness except the coroner. She walked out of the courtroom abruptly as a bartender testified about seeing photos.\n\nVillanueva is expected to be followed on the stand by LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone.\n\nKobe Bryant, 41, and Gianna Bryant, 13, were among nine people killed in the January 26, 2020, helicopter crash on a hillside in Calabasas, California.\n\nThey were flying to a girls basketball game at Bryant’s Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks when the helicopter went down, leaving no survivors.", "authors": ["Jason Kravarik Natasha Chen Cheri Mossburg", "Jason Kravarik", "Natasha Chen", "Cheri Mossburg"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/01/29/domestic-violence-research-children-abuse-mental-health-learning-aces/2227218002/", "title": "Domestic violence: Children who see abuse suffer as much as those ...", "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. – Latrelle Huff says her twins were conceived by rape.\n\nNow she blames domestic violence for her children's health problems.\n\nThe Georgia woman says she had been in an abusive, on-and-off relationship for six years when she became pregnant. While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued. Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her doctors said was caused by stress.\n\nTwo days after the twins were born in 2014, Huff says, the father took a swing at her. He was holding their newborn son. They were still in the hospital. Huff had just delivered by Cesarean section. \"He was so angry at me because my milk wouldn't come in,\" Huff, 39, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe boy was born with \"floppy baby syndrome,\" a muscular condition doctors said might be attributed to abuse during pregnancy. Both children struggle with health issues, including speech disorders, and have spent months in instructional therapy to learn how to follow directions.\n\nThe father denies sexually assaulting or abusing Huff. He was charged last year with assault and battery against her; his lawyer says he completed a pretrial program in September to avoid a conviction. In 2015, a grand jury in Savannah declined to indict him on sexual assault charges.\n\nNew research is giving scientists more insight into the far-reaching and long-lasting harms of domestic violence to the children who grow up around it – including a startling finding: Witnessing abuse carries the same risk of harm to children's mental health and learning as being abused directly.\n\nBrain imaging in infants shows that exposure to domestic violence – even as they are sleeping, or in utero – can reduce parts of the brain, change its overall structure and affect the way its circuits work together.\n\nStudies show that when babies born to mothers who were subjected to violence during pregnancy become adults, they have three times as much inflammation in their bodies as those whose mothers weren't. Inflammation causes a much higher risk of poor health, and a far greater likelihood of depression.\n\nAnd research also shows that these children are as likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as soldiers returning from war.\n\nPsychologist Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, past president of the American Psychological Association's division of trauma psychology, said \"babies are like a blank slate.\"\n\n\"If a mother is beaten while pregnant, there is a chance the baby will be injured, delivered prematurely, and there is a stack of other things that can happen – including physiological programming of the hyperactive stress system that leads to inflammation as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like when a soldier comes back from combat, hears a click and hits the ground.\"\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4.5 million and 15 million children are exposed to physical violence in the home. Verbal and emotional abuse in the home is more difficult to track.\n\nSocial workers, health care providers and academics have long tracked the effects of trauma suffered by children growing up in urban neighborhoods with frequent gunfire and other violence. But outside of medical journals, there has been little reporting on the effect of the more common domestic violence on the millions of children who grow up on the residential battlefields where it occurs.\n\nNeuroscientist Tanja Jovanovic directs the Grady Trauma Project, a research institute based at Emory University in Atlanta. The risk of PTSD from domestic violence is high, she says, because it's a \"betrayal by someone who is supposed to be to a protector.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Jovanovic said, domestic violence often eliminates the \"buffering effect of another positive adult,\" because the adult who is targeted can't provide comfort to the children who witness it.\n\nPsychologist Abigail Gewirtz says domestic violence can feel scarier than war. Gewirtz is the director of the Institute of Translational Research in Children's Mental Health at the University of Minnesota. It's \"one of the most terrifying forms of violence because it happens in a place which is supposed to be safe,\" she said. \"Children are totally powerless, especially very young children. They are totally dependent on their parents.”\n\nRead more:\n\nDomestic violence 'code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\n'Toxic stress' on children can harm their lifelong learning, mental and physical health\n\nExposure also reduces the potential of babies and toddlers to learn. Alissa Huth-Bocks, a child psychologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said the \"most damaging time\" is during pregnancy and the first three years of life, when development \"takes the biggest hit at the brain level.\"\n\nLong-lasting consequences\n\nNegative consequences continue well into adulthood. Among childhood adversities, Ronald Kessler says, those involving family violence inflict the worst long-term effects.\n\nKessler is a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the principal investigator of the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey – the first nationally representative survey of mental disorders in the United States. He is co-director of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\n\n\"One of the long-term effects of childhood adversity is that they create emotional scars that get reopened when people are exposed to traumas in adulthood – leading to adult PTSD,\" Kessler said.\n\nFor people of color, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, the effects of trauma are often magnified, federally funded research shows, because they are more likely to suffer from systemic racism, discrimination and microaggressions.\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Child Trends reported last year that 6 percent of kids nationally – about 4.5 million children – had seen or heard parents or other adults slap, hit, kick or punch each other in the home. Four percent had been exposed to or victims of neighborhood violence.\n\nThe results were based on a survey of parents about their children. In five states – Arizona, Mississippi, Arkansas, Hawaii and Tennessee – at least 10 percent of children had been exposed to domestic violence at home.\n\nChild Trends says parents likely under-report violence in the home out of embarrassment or fear of stigma. The research doesn't include the psychological and emotional abuse, including gaslighting, that many women and some men told USA TODAY was far worse for them and their children to live with.\n\nThe findings, children's health advocates say, underscore a need for improved detection and prevention of domestic violence, and better treatment of abuse survivors and their children in the health care system, schools and the courts.\n\nGeorgia, Huff's home, is among the states where the law recognizes the effects of domestic violence on children. The state has created criminal charges for domestic violence that happens anywhere in a house where children are present, not just when it occurs in front of the child.\n\nIn other ways, specialists say, the law and courts have a long way to go in recognizing the impact on children's well-being. Parents accused or even convicted of domestic violence in many cases are able to gain unsupervised visits with their children, or partial or full partial custody – even when children are afraid of the offender.\n\nWhen parents in an abusive relationship separate, conditions for their children can become even riskier. The nonprofit group Center for Judicial Excellence, which monitors family courts, found that more than 650 children were killed by a parent in a \"divorce, separation, custody, visitation, child support situation\" from 2008 through 2018.\n\nDomestic violence crosses racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Cheryl Branch, executive director at Savannah's SAFE women's shelter, says the calls she gets from abused women in The Landings, an exclusive gated community, are as horrific as those that come from low-income clients.\n\nShe says women are afraid to leave husbands who threaten to spend whatever it takes to gain full custody of the children. When shelter residents go back to their domestic abusers – as many do – Branch is required to notify child protection authorities, just as she would be if a parent returned to someone who has sexually abused his or her child.\n\nHuth-Bocks, the Cleveland psychologist, says researchers' ability to study human brain development has \"exploded in the last five to six years.\" So has data on the mental health and addiction effects of adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs – 10 harmful experiences or conditions, including domestic violence, tracked by health professionals.\n\nGenerations of violence\n\nIn San Diego, the children of now-divorced Eric and Yadira Sanchez – Angel, Noel and their 15-year-old brother – say they can vividly recall visiting their maternal grandparents' house when they were young.\n\nThey talk about seeing their grandmother punch cabinet doors and throw drinking glasses. She and their grandfather would hit each other in front of them, they say. The grandparents could not be reached for comment.\n\nLater, Angel and Noel say, they watched as their mother chased their father with a kitchen knife and smashed a piece of a wood across his back. In December 2011, police arrested Yadira Sanchez on charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and felony spousal battery, but prosecutors declined to pursue the charges.\n\nAs the alleged violence escalated, the children's grades and mental health declined, a review of school and medical records shows. (USA TODAY is not identifying the youngest son because he is a minor.)\n\n\"When these high levels of stress happen too often and too intensely, it creates a toxic pathway that alters how our brains and bodies operate and how we think, learn and behave,\" said psychologist Sheri Madigan, a professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nYadira Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, acknowledges that the boys were exposed to domestic violence. But he claims Eric Sanchez's efforts to separate the boys from their mother likely hurt them far more.\n\n\"This is not a case where physical violence was the primary factor,\" Marcus said.\n\nChange to brain, body\n\nResearchers who followed 1,420 children in North Carolina from age 9 to 30 found that exposure to domestic violence in the home had the same serious and life-changing effects as experiencing the abuse directly.\n\nThe American Medical Association published the study in November. University of Vermont psychologist William Copeland was its lead author. These children \"have the same type of poor outcomes 10, 20 years down the road\" as children who \"experience it directly themselves,\" he said.\n\nA global study out last year of more than 125,000 people from all socioeconomic backgrounds found children who witnessed domestic violence had the same risk and incidence of PTSD as soldiers returning from war.\n\nResearch presented in November at the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies shows that children exposed at an early age to trauma, including domestic violence, have a smaller hippocampus – the brain area related to learning and memory formation – a risk factor for PTSD.\n\nOther research shows that the amygdala – the part of the brain that processes emotions, memory and fear – in children who have been exposed to violence reacts more strongly to threats than in children who haven't.\n\nEamon McCrory, a professor of developmental neuroscience at University College London, says the changes make it more difficult for these children to get along with others. Other studies have shown that exposing children to violence leads to lower grades and a greater probability of dropping out of school.\n\nPsychologist and professor Katie McLaughlin directs the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard. \"This change in size and likely the function of the hippocampus could be one potential mechanism that's underlying those differences in school achievement,\" she said. The brain works to help protect from danger. But when children are dealing with adversity, their brains can be overwhelmed.\n\nLearning disordered\n\nCatholic high schools around San Diego began scouting Angel Sanchez when he was in middle school, according to Phillip Lomax, his coach at the time. The strapping middle linebacker – he was 6-foot-tall and 225 pounds in high school – was hard to miss.\n\nProblem was, Sanchez said, just as his athletic abilities began gaining notice, his home life deteriorated and his grades dropped.\n\nHis mother stayed out late at night, his father found other men's numbers on her phone, and a pattern of erratic and often violent behavior against the boys and their father developed, Eric Sanchez said in requests for restraining orders and police reports.\n\nThe three boys each had an Individual Education Program detailing how they best learn given their disabilities. Angel has a speech impairment that affects his oral and written communication, reading comprehension and math problem solving. Noel was granted accommodations to receive extra time for homework and tests. The youngest boy struggles with reading and writing. All the boys were given intensive tutoring, language therapy and case managers.\n\nAs tensions between the parents rose, Angel's grade point average dropped from 3.0 at the beginning of his sixth grade to 1.3 by the start of 7th grade, school transcripts show.\n\nThat was the year – 2008 – that their mother chased their father around a table with a steak knife and stabbed the padded kitchen stools, Eric Sanchez and the boys told child welfare workers.\n\nNoel Sanchez, now 18, recalls that period. \"Oh man, I can still see and hear what happened those nights. That’s not going to go anywhere,\" he said.\n\nIn children exposed to domestic violence, the parts of the brain that detect threats and anticipate pain – the anterior insula and amygdala – are strongly affected by threatening faces during brain imaging.\n\nResearchers at University College London wrote in 2011 that the results might predict a later risk factor for anxiety disorders and increasing vulnerability to mental illness. A more recent study by the same authors showed this heightened responsiveness was present even when children weren't consciously aware of a threat.\n\n\"If you've grown up in a situation that's dangerous, you're much more likely to react to something that's actually totally safe (as if it were) a potential threat,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nThe two younger Sanchez boys went back and forth between their feuding parents. Angel stayed with his father. School progress reports show that Noel missed 57 classes in the first three months of 2017. His younger brother missed 137.\n\nIn 2016, Yadira Sanchez was granted a restraining order against Angel. Her lawyer, Ethan Marcus, says Angel kept trying to take his brothers away from their mother. Yadira lost custody of the boys in March 2017.\n\nLomax, the coach, says the chaos hurt Angel's future plans. \"If you’d asked me, when he was going into 9th grade, what Angel’s potential as a linebacker was, he was certainly a Division I contender, for sure,\" he said.\n\nEric Sanchez, the father, says one high school withdrew a scholarship offer after it saw Angel's grades. He missed practice often during high school during the parents' custody fight.\n\nNoel Sanchez says that the turmoil before their parents separated, and stays with their mother after the split, were so traumatic that he attempted suicide in 2014 and considered it at other times. \"I was just trying to hurt myself to let the pain go away,\" he said.\n\nMore:Surviving Suicide Q&A: Laura answers your questions on loss, depression, the hard stuff\n\nMore:After a suicide, here’s what happens to the people left behind\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nDebbie Ricker says domestic violence looms over three generations of her family. Both the California woman and her daughter Desiree say it led to Desiree's drug and alcohol abuse, and other mental and physical health struggles.\n\nRicker fought a 15-year custody battle with her ex-husband. It ended only when her son turned 18. She says the emotional abuse she suffered and her children witnessed still affects them. \"My ex was very open with his abuse toward me,\" she said. \"The abuse occurred in front of our kids, friends, family.\"\n\nDesiree, now 29, said \"I never heard him be nice to her. He belittled her every step of the way.\"\n\nMarc Loehren, Debbie Ricker's ex-husband and Desiree's father, denies their allegations. He was never charged with a crime against them. “My two children had a wonderful childhood,\" he told USA TODAY. \"There was no violence in this household. ... if anything, the mom hit me with a car.”\n\nHe acknowledges the children have been to multiple psychologists. But he cites Ricker's family background and marriages before and after their relationship. He alleges that Ricker tried to undermine his relationship with the children.\n\n\"The children are fairly disturbed from anything that the mom has told them – which is alienation,\" Loehren said.\n\nDuring an interview for a family evaluation during the custody fight, Loehren said Ricker was scaring the children by calling the police when he allegedly violated restraining orders.\n\nBased on the evaluator's recommendation, a family court judge ordered the parents into joint counseling. The judge said each had to educate themselves on \"child development and high parental conflict.\"\n\nRicker, 62, says she asked for a divorce. She says Loehren suggested the two of them sit down and explain it to the children. She says he opened he conversation by saying \"Mommy doesn't like daddy anymore, so she is breaking our family apart.\" The kids started screaming and crying, Ricker says. Then they started to hit her.\n\nDesiree started to gain weight when she was about 5. A therapist would later attribute the weight gain to the family dysfunction. When Desiree was 12, the family doctor told Ricker that her daughter had pre-diabetes. \"It just made me cry,\" Ricker says.\n\nIn high school, Desiree says, she gained about 100 pounds – weight she still carries. At 12, Desiree says, she began an abusive relationship with a boyfriend who also came from a violent home. It lasted, on and off, until she was 27. The ex-boyfriend was never charged with abusing her.\n\nStudies show that childhood adversities can lead to obesity later in life. Duke University researchers reported last year that children aged 12 to 15 were far more likely to eat poorly and less likely to get physical activity after exposure to domestic violence.\n\n'These things go together'\n\nIt's common for children who are exposed to domestic violence to also suffer other adverse childhood experiences. ACEs are linked to a range of mental and physical health consequences throughout life, up to and including early death.\n\n“If there's domestic violence in the household, it's statistically likely that there's also physical abuse and emotional abuse and maybe drug abuse or alcohol abuse,\" said Canan Karatekin, a professor of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota. \"These things go together.”\n\nHuff took on the role of protector of her younger siblings. It carried its own burden.\n\nDuring the summer before fifth grade, she says, she remembers holding one of her sisters in her lap as another was rushed to the hospital after the first of several suicide attempts. \"I had to grow up fast and be a second mom to my siblings,\" she says. \"It made me stronger. ... I was determined not to be like my sister or my mother.\"\n\nBut that was nearly impossible.\n\nHuff and her mother say domestic violence spans generations in their family.\n\nDenise Boyd was caring for a year-old daughter while she was pregnant with Huff at 21. Boyd was having a breakdown, she says, after years living with the abusive father of her children.\n\nThe father could not be reached for comment. He was never charged with a crime against Boyd.\n\nBoyd's mother went to take her home to Georgia. Once in her parents' home, Boyd says, she rarely went out. On rare occasions when she did, she would hide on the floor of the family car. \"I felt like I wasn’t the same anymore,\" Boyd said. \"I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nHuff was born in August 1979. As a little girl, she developed a speech disorder. In eighth grade, Huff says, she was so anxious she tried to run away. She was sent briefly to a juvenile detention facility.\n\nDavid Murphey, director of the Child Trends DataBank, describes domestic violence as a type of toxic stress linked to health problems later in life. Domestic violence rewires the brain, he said, harming executive function – \"the ability to weigh options and make well-considered choices.\"\n\nHow can communities best address abuse?\n\nDetecting, treating and preventing exposure to domestic abuse are the keys to reducing it, specialists say.\n\nCertified nurse midwife Pamela Glenn, field education supervisor at Minneapolis's Walden University School of Nursing, has screened her patients for abuse for 30 years.\n\nShe says health care professionals should create a safe space for patients, don't judge or blame, and avoid using the word \"abuse.\"\n\n“Most people, when they hear the word 'abuse,' they automatically think physical violence,\" Glenn said. \"The abuse may be emotional abuse only – but that can be extremely damaging to people's health.”\n\nShe asks questions such as “Does your partner support you?\" And \"Do you ever find that your partner is constantly checking up on you when you're not together and almost interrogating you at times?\" If she suspects abuse, she says, she offers resources such as information for an advocate or safe place.\n\nSpecialists say screening alone is not enough. \"Screening is the great first step, but it's only a first step,\" said Jess Bartlett, a trauma researcher with Child Trends. \"Too often we look at what kids have experienced, but not how they function.\" She says health care providers should look at children's needs, and whether the community has the resources to respond.\n\nMurphey agrees. “Unless there are adequate networks of services and referral practices to follow the results up,\" he said, \"what you're doing is you're really setting up an unfortunate situation where you know you've got lots of problems but you don't have services in place yet to respond to them.”\n\nWith treatment, researchers wrote in a report for the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, children exposed to early trauma including domestic violence can overcome the experiences without developing stress-related disorders.\n\nOften the support of parents, friends, family and school can help alleviate the effects of stress and trauma in children, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network.\n\n\"A strong relationship with a caring, nonviolent parent is one of the most important factors in helping children grow in a positive way despite their experiences,\" the group wrote in a 2014 report.\n\nBut Huth-Bocks said the parents she works with are often \"preoccupied keeping everyone alive and can't always be the most sensitive parent.\n\n\"There’s bigger fish to fry.\"\n\n'Pure chaos'\n\nHuff says it was a violent world that her twins entered in July 2014.\n\nShe says the father was holding the boy two days after their birth when he took a swing at her. The girl was the crib behind Huff, she says. She says she had to hold onto the crib to keep it from falling.\n\nThe father, Ignacio Ramirez Vallejo, denies her account. \"It never happened,\" he told USA TODAY. He was not charged in the alleged incident. “I’ve been in court many times,\" he said. \"Latrelle tried to accuse me for many different things. We were together almost seven years. They never find me guilty.”\n\nRamirez Vallejo says he did not sexually assault Huff.\n\nHis lawyer, A.J. Balbo, gave USA TODAY copies of letters he says Huff wrote to Ramirez Vallejo two years before the twins' birth saying she wanted to have children with him. “Everything they say about me is not true,\" Ignacio Ramirez said. \"I’m a Christian.”\n\nJeanne Fell, a nurse practitioner who specializes in neurology and has treated Huff's twins, says the pregnancy was about as complicated as they come. Huff had severe vomiting during much of the pregnancy and required intravenous medication. A cesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks. A typical pregnancy lasts 40.\n\n\"It's been pure chaos since these kids have been born,\" Fell said. \"She does her very best, but certainly there are limits to how much she can give of herself to the children.\"\n\nBoth babies were poor eaters, Fell says. The boy had hyptonia, or floppy baby syndrome, which can be caused by nerve or brain damage. He's now on a powerful antipsychotic drug to help with aggression or and self injury, a review of his medical records show. Fell said he's \"done really well and is much more calm,\" but if he goes off the drug, she said, he hits others and tries to escape.\n\nHuff has been getting reports from her daughter's school, including one reviewed by USA TODAY from October in which she was described as \"extra tearful today\" and accused of \"mooning\" several other children.\n\nNeither child sleeps more than five hours a night, Huff says. Before he started on his current medication, Huff's son rarely slept more than three hours.\n\nHuff has a master's degree in mental health counseling and is pursuing a second master's in social work. She recently lost her job as an armed security guard after missing work to attend to her children's health appointments She's now looking for a job in mental health case work.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant, Ramirez-Vallejo was apprehended in Savannah not long after President Donald Trump took office, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman said. His case is pending in immigration court. He has argued he should be allowed to stay in this country because he has children here. He sees the children every other weekend for two full days, but is not allowed to spend the night with them.\n\nHuff says she tries to focus on the future.\n\n\"My dream is for my children to not grow up in a dysfunctional family, as I did and as their father did,\" she said. \"I want both children to feel safe and to be able to grow in an environment where they will be successful, stable and happy.\n\n\"The new generation needs an opportunity to live life without continuing the cycle.\"\n\nIf you or your child is experiencing domestic violence and/or mental health problems:\n\nContact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or online\n\nContact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255\n\nVisit the National Child Traumatic Stress Network to learn about resources and treatment.\n\nReporting for this article was supported by the Fund for Journalism on Child Well-Being, a program of the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism.\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with issues mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY’s \"I Survived It\" Facebook support group.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/walking-cancer-heart-early-death-wellness/index.html", "title": "Walking briskly reduces risk for cancer, heart disease, early death ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nPut on your walking shoes and don’t forget your step counter: You can reduce your risk for cancer, heart disease and early death by getting up to 10,000 steps a day, but any amount of walking helps, according to a new study.\n\nHealth benefits rose with every step, the study found, but peaked at 10,000 steps – after that the effects faded. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as house work, gardening and dog walks.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” noted study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\n“By and large, I think the study is well done and it certainly continues to add to the foundation of knowledge that tells us exercise is good stuff,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. He was not involved in the research.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Freeman said. “And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others – that’s your magic recipe. It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nWalking helps dementia too\n\nDel Pozo Cruz and his team recently published a similar study that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered risk for dementia by 50%. Risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day, according to the previous study.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once, either – it could be spread out over the day.\n\n“Our take is that intensity of stepping matters – over and above volume,” said del Pozo Cruz via email.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 78,500 people between the ages of 40 and 79 from England, Scotland and Wales who wore wrist step counters for 24 hours a day over a seven day stretch.\n\nAfter counting each person’s total number of steps each day, researchers placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking.\n\nA third category was created for peak performers – those who took the most steps per minute within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although, again, those 30 minutes did not have to occur in sequence).\n\nAbout seven years later, researchers compared that data to medical records and found people who took the most steps per minute – in this case, approximately 80 steps per minute – showed the biggest reduction in risk for cancer, heart disease and early death from any cause.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied.\n\n“We observed a 62% reduction for dementia: This figure was almost 80% for CVD mortality and incidence and much less (approx. 20%) for cancer,” del Pozo Cruz said via email.\n\n“This may be related with specific pathways by which physical activity is beneficial,” he said. “It pushes the body in general: can generate more muscle, a bigger heart and a better fitness, all of which are known protective factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, and other health issues too.”\n\nGet breathless\n\nWhat’s the takeaway? You don’t have to fixate on the numbers of steps (unless you really want to), Freeman said.\n\n“Does every step count? Absolutely. And we know that brisk walking each day brings on extra benefits in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular training and so forth,” said Freeman, who was the founding chair of the American College of Cardiology’s Nutrition & Lifestyle workgroup.\n\n“But the truth is, the same goal has always applied: Challenge yourself at whatever fitness level you’re at. Obviously check with your doctor first, but your goal is to become breathless for 30 minutes each day.”\n\nWhat is breathlessness as it applies to exercise? It’s not gasping and panting so hard you can barely breathe. Instead, breathlessness is when you are walking with someone, they talk to you, and you have a bit of trouble talking back, Freeman said.\n\n“Spend 30 minutes being breathless at whatever pace you’re at, and then keep challenging yourself to be slightly unsatisfied at your current level so you can get better and better,” Freeman said.\n\nBeing more physically active often jumpstarts other healthy habits, such as an improved diet, and discourages unhealthy ones, such as smoking, he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/health/no-dieting-for-my-kids-parenting-wellness/index.html", "title": "I gave up dieting for my kids. Here's why | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nI came of age in a house of fat-free cookies, Weight Watchers’ meetings and Denise Austin’s eight-minute abs. There was plenty of pasta and ice cream but also a focus on being skinny. In the decades since, I’ve counted points, intermittently fasted and completed fitness challenges to make my body smaller.\n\nSo it was no surprise that I was concerned when I spotted a doctor’s note in my electronic health portal that described me as “overweight but alert.”\n\nThough I knew body mass index, better known as BMI, was a questionable barometer of health, I was alarmed that mine had crept beyond the so-called healthy range. Amid studies citing obesity as a risk factor for severe Covid-19 and endless suggestions of how to lose those “pandemic pounds,” I felt determined to fix myself in a hurry.\n\nI chose a sensible nutrition plan, one touted as a “lifestyle change,” not a diet. Still, I worried about how it might affect my kids (ages 7, 12 and 15) to watch me tracking my food intake, following rules such as “water first, veggies most” and skipping carbohydrates at dinner.\n\nThe pandemic has caused a dramatic global spike in mental health issues and disordered eating for teens, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. After reviewing 11 worldwide peer-reviewed studies, the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute identified an 83% increase in pediatric hospital admissions for eating disorders during the pandemic.\n\nI couldn’t block the dangerous messages of diet culture from reaching my family, but I didn’t want to cause additional harm with my own behavior. I found a book I wished I’d read as a teen, “No Weigh: A Teen’s Guide to Positive Body Image, Food, and Emotional Wisdom,” coauthored by three teen experts: adolescent medicine physician Dr. Shelley Aggarwal, eating disorder therapist Signe Darpinian and registered dietitian Wendy Sterling. Though intended for teens, the book resonated with me both individually and as a parent.\n\nIn March, this trio collaborated on a down-to-earth guide for parents. “Raising Body Positive Teens: A Parent’s Guide to Diet-Free Living, Exercise and Body Image” has changed the narrative in my head and household, as I support my teen, tween and 7-year-old to cultivate a balanced relationship with food and body.\n\nHere’s what I learned from the authors about the science of raising truly healthy kids.\n\nDo parents’ eating and dieting habits influence how their children eat?\n\nYes, these experts say. It’s well-established that “how a parent is eating, how they are buying, how they are preparing, how they are plating and how they are offering food influences the experience of the child in reference to food and body,” Aggarwal said.\n\nParents should let their kids know that their worth doesn't depend on their appearance or weight. The Good Brigade/Digital Vision/Getty Images\n\nThough I’m quick to blame my mom for modeling dieting behavior during my childhood, I recognize she likely internalized the diet culture norms of her day.\n\nAggarwal urged parents to reflect on their own complicated experiences with body image and try to develop a personal practice of well-being. “You can only give what you have,” she told me kindly.\n\nWhat’s wrong with working on weight loss?\n\nIn our culture, and especially in medicine, “weight has been overvalued as a marker of health,” Aggarwal said. Chief among the faulty messages of diet culture that parents inadvertently pass onto kids is using the word “health” as “code for thin.”\n\n“Thin does not equal health,” Aggarwal said, so we need to shift away from using weight to indicate whether anyone is healthy, attractive or worthy. Parents should make clear to kids that no person’s worth rests on their appearance, their weight or how or what they eat.\n\nIt’s critical for parents to understand the “biological, psychosocial and cognitive needs of their changing young person,” Aggarwal said. Gaining weight and changing shape are normal and expected parts of puberty. Fat aids body function, she noted, even in the brain, of which 60% is made up of adipose (fat) tissue.\n\nHow can focusing on eating ‘healthy’ become problematic for families?\n\nThe pressure parents feel to raise “healthy” kids of a particular weight can lead them to adopt rigid approaches to meals and snacks, including rules such as saying “no dessert until you finish dinner,” obsessing over nutritional information and categorizing foods as “good” or “bad.”\n\nThese restrictions often backfire, according to Sterling. Restrictive feeding disrupts a child’s innate ability to listen to their internal hunger and fullness cues and has been shown to be a risk factor for disordered eating and eating disorders.\n\nRigid rules about meals and snacks can often backfire and lead to disorders such as binge eating. Hakase_/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nFurther, parental encouragement of dieting in kids was a significant predictor of a higher risk of overweight or obesity, dieting, binge eating, engaging in unhealthy weight control behaviors and lower body satisfaction, according to a 2018 study.\n\nThe experts recommend checking whether a teen’s or your own relationship with food or exercise seems imbalanced. Parents commonly reported overlooking signs of disordered eating because they thought their teen was just “trying to eat healthier and exercise more,” according to Darpinian.\n\nWhat should parents do instead to promote wellness?\n\n“Food is so much more than protein, starch, and vitamins and minerals, yet many people struggle to have fun with food,” Aggarwal said. She encouraged families to remember that food is at the “heart of the human experience” and an important source of connection through cultural traditions, holidays and special events.\n\nInstead of obsessing about weight, try intuitive eating and listen to your body's cues about food. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nTo promote a body-positive household, stop talking about diet, weight and shape and be judgment-free about other people’s bodies, Sterling said. Learn about intuitive eating, which dietitians have recommended for decades. For kids whose eating seems out of balance, Sterling suggested teaching them to use a “hunger meter” to determine their level of hunger before making food choices.\n\nFamilies must look beyond appearance toward a broader view of the core things that allow us to experience wellness, such as mental health, sleep, and eating and moving in ways that are fulfilling and joyful.\n\nComments such as “I’ll need to run tomorrow to work off this dessert” troublingly link exercise with food intake. Instead, the authors said in their chapter on sleep, parents can “focus on the many practical benefits of exercise, including improved mood, energy and sleep, stress relief and metabolic fitness.”\n\nHow can we help teens manage stress, sleep and social media?\n\nParents can guide teens toward choices that have been shown to be scientifically critical to wellness. For example, the authors pointed to studies that show the ways sufficient and consistent sleep improves sports and academic performance.\n\nSimilarly, technology use should be intentional and regulated. Parents should proactively monitor – and teach kids to build awareness of – time spent online and the impact social media has on their sleep and self-esteem.\n\nWhat if a parent or child is starting from a place of hating their larger body?\n\nIf “body positivity” sounds unattainable for parents and teens unhappy with their bodies, Darpinian recommended using micro-goals that have been proven to help us reach our goals more effectively. To improve body image, practice reducing body checking behaviors such as obsessively looking in the mirror or at photos or comparing yourself with others.\n\nTo improve body image, avoid constantly looking in mirrors or comparing yourself with others. TomFoldes/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nInstead of focusing exclusively on trying to reach an ideal weight or size, the experts suggest encouraging wellness behaviors that promote overall intuitive self-care.\n\n“We know that if you improve your health behaviors and you’re doing a good job of getting yourself to bed on time, you’re handling stress effectively, you’re eating in an intuitive way and in the habit of moving in ways that are joyful to you, the result is going to be your body’s natural body weight,” Darpinian said. A therapist can help if there is grief or disappointment involved in accepting where one’s body naturally ends up.\n\nHow do we discuss body stigma with teens and set boundaries with family members?\n\nThe authors included wisdom from diet culture dismantler Virginia Sole-Smith, such as how to respond when your teen asks, “Am I fat?” or talks about dieting, and how to discuss fat phobia.\n\nThe book also provides helpful scripts for challenging boundary-setting situations. I never could pinpoint what bothered me about comments (even positive ones) on my appearance until the authors supplied the perfect response: “When you comment on my body without my consent, I feel angry, and hear in my mind that you are scrutinizing my body.”\n\nGiving up dieting doesn’t mean I’ve given up on my family’s health.

The plot of “Encanto,” she says, perfectly captures issues many families are going through.\n\n“There are so many layers, so many dynamics,” Adelakun says.\n\nWhile catchy songs from “Encanto” are topping the charts, Disney’s latest animated film is drawing praise from therapists like Adelakun for another reason: the way the movie portrays trauma and healing.\n\nTherapists who spoke with CNN say they’re talking about the movie with their clients – many of whom are first-generation children of immigrants who see themselves reflected in the story, hear their experiences in the soundtrack, and are using “Encanto” to speak out about things that otherwise might go unsaid.\n\n“I think it’s going to have a great impact on society. … People are seeing this movie and they’re realizing they’re seeing themselves in it,” Adelakun says.\n\nHere’s a look at several key “Encanto” characters and the conversations they’re sparking:\n\nThe healer trying to keep her family whole\n\nDisney\n\nThe character: Mirabel\n\nThe song that stands out: “Waiting On a Miracle”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt the beginning of “Encanto,” Mirabel introduces us to the Madrigal family, gleefully describing each person’s “gift,” or magical power. We later learn that the magic and the family’s enchanted house have a darker side, originating in a traumatic moment after the family was forced to flee their home, trudge through the wilderness and cross a river seeking safety.\n\nMirabel is the only member of the Madrigal family who doesn’t get a gift. But in the end, her power is in seeing her family members for who they are and doing all she can to keep them together.\n\n“Mirabel was really the glue to the family, but no one was really seeing it,” Adelakun says.\n\nAnd it’s no coincidence that her character is someone many can identify with, says Mara Sammartino, a therapist in Fairfield, California.\n\n“Our parents come here fleeing war, poverty, violence. They come here, they establish a life, and then we’re born into this duality, and we’re not seen in one, and we’re not seen in the other. I think that’s why Mirabel’s character resonates,” says Sammartino, whose parents came to the United States from Nicaragua. “She is part of that duality. She’s the only one that’s in touch with the community. … She’s the only one that’s (leaving the house) and going out, talking to people. Then she comes back home and she’s kind of put in her place and told, ‘you actually don’t have anything to contribute.’”\n\nJenny Lemus, a psychotherapist in Chicago, says she heard feelings many of her clients have expressed for years in Mirabel’s song, “Waiting on a Miracle.”\n\n“She’s trying to communicate with her grandmother – ‘Look, this is what I’m experiencing. I want to be seen.’ A lot of times, the younger generations, what I’ve seen over the years, they want to be seen (by their families), they want the acknowledgment at least, and they’re not getting it,” Lemus says.\n\nThe perfectionist who feels she can’t fail\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Isabela\n\nThe song that stands out: “What Else Can I Do?”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt first glance, Isabela looks like she has it all; she can make flowers out of thin air and tosses her long hair like she doesn’t have a care in the world. But her song reveals how limiting perfectionism can be.\n\nAdelakun, whose parents came to the US from Trinidad and Tobago, says the message is relatable for many immigrants’ children – including her.\n\n“In my family, one of the main things is about not letting your family down … especially when you know they’ve made sacrifices to come to this country, to send you to good schools, to live in certain neighborhoods, just the importance of not letting your family down and trying to hold up to their expectations,” she says.\n\nFirst-generation children constantly “get the message that we need to be more,” says Lemus, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Guatemala. And those pressures, she says, can take a major toll.\n\n“There’s a lot of anger. Sometimes we don’t know where the anger comes from. Why do I feel so angry with my parents or grandparents? What’s going on?… You see that a lot with first-generation Latinos, a lot of resentment building up because of that pressure that is unspoken within the family dynamic,” Lemus says.\n\n“‘Encanto’ had such a beautiful way of portraying that in subtle ways. … Those of us that saw the movie and related to it, we got the message. We related so much to it. And I think that’s why it’s been such a hit.”\n\nThe sibling carrying the weight of her family on her shoulders\n\nFrom Disney/Youtube\n\nThe character: Luisa\n\nThe song that stands out: “Surface Pressure”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nBig-muscled Luisa is used to carrying anything her family needs her to handle. And her song confessing that she’s about to crack under the weight of it all is resonating with many people.\n\n“It describes what anxiety feels like perfectly,” says Lemus, whose patients are predominately first-generation Latinos.\n\n“A lot of clients relate to Luisa, who is experiencing the pressure of … carrying the burden for their younger siblings … having that pressure (of) protecting the younger siblings from their own experiences. It is eye-opening, and I’m so glad that I have clients that are very insightful and can relate to it.”\n\nSeeing Luisa’s struggle depicted on screen can help those who are dealing with similar difficulties better understand and describe their own situation, Sammartino says.\n\n“I think ‘Encanto’ gives a little bit of space for some clients. They can say, ‘Oh, well, look at Luisa.’ They’re not going to say, ‘Well, that’s me.’ They say, ‘Luisa experiences that. I feel for Luisa.’”\n\nThe family secret that goes unspoken\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Bruno\n\nThe song that stands out: “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nWhen it comes to Bruno, who’s ostracized by his family and ends up hiding in the walls of the Madrigal house so he can be nearby but not have to face them, there’s plenty to talk about.\n\nBruno’s gift is seeing the future, and his family members blame him when the prophecies come true. Some of his mannerisms have sparked speculation about other possible diagnoses for the character, who’s the focus of the movie’s most popular song.\n\n“He thinks differently. He sees things differently,” Adelakun says. “We have family members who are also neurodivergent or have mental health issues, and because they’re different, they get shunned, or they’re not spoken about.”\n\nFamily secrets like the stories that come out when Bruno is discussed in the film are a common sign of the intergenerational trauma many first-generation families deal with, Lemus says.\n\n“We don’t talk about feelings. We don’t talk about emotions. We don’t talk about trauma. It’s so taboo to bring it up, and it’s uncomfortable to even express ourselves,” says Lemus, who says she tries to work with patients to help them learn how to better communicate those feelings.\n\n“But also, she says, “without the expectation that it’s going to be taken the way we expect it to be. Because…we don’t know how our parents or grandparents are going to take those hard conversations. … Generation from generation, if you didn’t learn how to express your emotions, you’re not going to know how to communicate in a healthy way.”\n\nThe matriarch who passes down her trauma\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\n\nThe character: Abuela\n\nThe song that stands out: “Dos Oruguitas” (played in the background during a flashback showing the traumatic origins of the Madrigal family’s powers)\n\nWhat therapists are hearing: Protecting her family and their enchanted home is Abuela’s top priority. She’s obsessed with maintaining their magical powers and fails to realize how her experiences as a young mother – fleeing her home and losing her husband – have shaped her and her family. It’s only when the house crumbles and she almost loses everything that she sees her role in fracturing the family.\n\nFor Sammartino, it’s a perfect example to point to when she’s trying to help her clients empathize with their elders.\n\n“My way of trying to support my clients is to really develop a lens of empathy for their parents and the trauma that they experienced,” Sammartino says. “Like Abuela in the movie, her husband was murdered in front of her. Why wouldn’t she be overprotective?”\n\nIt’s a classic illustration of intergenerational trauma, Adelakun says – and something that’s likely to increasingly resonate as the film gets a wider audience.\n\n“As more people see this movie, or as more people talk about it, I think you’re probably going to see more people realizing they have repressed these things. I wonder how many people we’re going to see say, ‘I didn’t realize, or I forgot, but I had those same experiences, too,’ or, ‘I didn’t realize I was doing that to my family members.’ Abuela didn’t realize she was doing all this to harm her family,” Adelakun says.\n\nIn the movie, Abuela apologizes once she realizes the harm she’s caused.\n\nBut Lemus cautions there’s one thing that’s important to remember.\n\nIn real life, she says, Disney endings are rare.\n\n“We don’t see that outcome often. When we do see it, when we see the Mirabels of the world making changes for their family and making changes for themselves, it’s so beautiful,” she says. “It’s also beautiful when they do the work and when they realize they need to set boundaries in their families.”\n\nSometimes, families become estranged rather than coming together with a shared understanding. It’s a sad outcome, Lemus says, but doesn’t stop individuals from coming to terms with trauma and giving a healthy start to future generations.\n\nEven without a Disney ending, she says, it’s possible to heal.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

The troubling results showed:\n\nAmong the women who gave birth, 1,061 suffered a heart attack during their labor and delivery, 922 during pregnancy and 2,390 in the six months after they gave birth.\n\nIn addition, 4.5 percent of the pregnant women who had heart attacks died.\n\nPregnant women in their early 40s were considered to be 10 times more at risk than women in their 20s.\n\nWhy are pregnant women and new moms having more heart attacks?\n\nI believe part of the reason for the increased rate of heart attacks among pregnant women is age. It is not uncommon for my obstetrician and cardiology colleagues and me to treat women in their late 30s and early 40s who have waited to have a child for various reasons.\n\nAge aside, I believe the increased incidences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and elevated cholesterol are also contributing factors to this health hazard to pregnant women. Hormonal changes and stress on the heart could be culprits, too.\n\nThough heart attacks among pregnant women are on the rise, it is important to note that the rate was very low then and remains the case now. However, it does not mean that the issue is not cause for concern. Pregnant women should listen to their bodies and be aware of signs and symptoms that could be triggers for heart issues.\n\nAmong the warning signs are:\n\nChest discomfort\n\nShortness of breath\n\nDifficulty breathing when lying flat\n\nLeg swelling\n\nPregnancy is a complex condition and many of these symptoms may appear routinely due to the pregnancy itself. However, they can also be signs of serious heart issues. If the issues are serious enough, a doctor may recommend additional testing such as an electrocardiogram or refer patients to a cardiologist for further evaluation.\n\nWhat can pregnant women do to protect their hearts?\n\nLeading a healthy lifestyle is the best way to protect the heart while pregnant. If possible, make lifestyle changes before you become pregnant. Discuss your lifestyle habits with your doctor and follow some general guidelines:\n\nChoose healthy foods and monitor your weight gain with your doctor to ensure you are within a healthy weight range. Avoid salt, which can increase blood pressure and cause bladder retention. Avoid alcohol and tobacco. Also avoid going to places where you may encounter second-hand smoke. Avoid caffeine as it could trigger irregular heartbeats. Take prenatal vitamins as prescribed by your doctor to ensure you are getting enough nutrients. Keep active with moderate exercise as long as you can. Get at least eight hours of sleep each night.\n\nMany factors influence the ability to get a good night's sleep during pregnancy, including hormonal changes, lack of comfortable positions, waking up at night to go to the bathroom, stress and anxiety about the pregnancy and motherhood. If you can’t get a full eight hours each night, try taking naps during the day. Long-term sleep deprivation can be a detriment to heart health.\n\nOther factors to consider:\n\nTalk to your doctor about getting a flu shot. Battling a bad flu can strain your heart, and your doctor may recommend it.\n\nAvoid flying after 28 weeks. Most airlines require a physician’s note if you need to travel late in your pregnancy.\n\nFollow through with your regular physician visits.\n\nSome women develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. While this is often temporary and does not allow for enough time for the development of heart disease, it could serve as a risk factor for the development of diabetes later in life. As such, it may identify women who are at increased risk for cardiovascular events later in life. Studies have indeed shown that women who developed gestational diabetes were at higher risk for development of cardiovascular events later in their lives but that the incorporation of a healthy lifestyle could help limit this risk.\n\nA new baby on the way is wondrous and something to be celebrated. Take the extra time to care for your heart health so that you and your newborn can have a happy, healthy start to your life together.\n\nDr. Rahool Karnik is a cardiologist on staff at Abrazo Arrowhead and Central campuses, along with Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital.\n\nREAD MORE:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/12/parking-pain-causes-financial-and-personal-strain/467637001/", "title": "Drivers spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for parking ...", "text": "Searching for parking is more painful than ever for U.S. drivers.\n\nMotorists spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for spots on streets, in lots, or in garages, according to a report issued Wednesday.\n\nThe hunt adds up to an estimated $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel, and emissions, according to the analysis by INRIX, a leading specialist in connected car services and transportation analytics.\n\nOverpaying — caused by drivers' inability to estimate how long they need to park or forking over extra at a garage to avoid the risk of getting a parking ticket — costs Americans more than $20 billion a year or $97 per driver, the report estimated.\n\nHunting for parking \"imposes significant costs on our pocketbooks that we often don't think about,\" and also adds to (traffic) congestion,\" said Bob Pishue, an INRIX transportation analyst and co-author of the report. \"This is a problem not only drivers face, but local shops and businesses, too.\"\n\nMotorists in large cities endure the toughest challenges.\n\nIn New York City, the hardest-hit U.S. urban area, drivers on average spend 107 hours a year looking for parking spots, the report said.

Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic began, the most infectious and transmissible variant yet has arrived.\n\nRepeated Covid-19 waves have left millions of people dead, with only vaccines helping to blunt the toll. Now the virus is spreading again — evolving, escaping immunity and driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The latest version of its shape-shifting, BA.5, is a clear sign that the pandemic is far from over.\n\nThe newest offshoot of Omicron, along with a closely related variant, BA.4, are fueling a global surge in cases — 30% over the past fortnight, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn Europe, the Omicron subvariants are powering a spike in cases of about 25%, though Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, has said that number may actually be higher, given the “almost collapse in testing.” BA.5 is on the march in China, ratcheting anxieties that major cities there may soon re-enforce strict lockdown measures that were only recently lifted. And the same variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, where it accounted for 65% of new infections last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Dr. Fauci explains why new BA.5 subvariant is concerning 04:58 - Source: CNN\n\n“We have been watching this virus evolve rapidly. We’ve been planning and preparing for this moment. And the message that I want to get across to the American people is this: BA.5 is something we’re closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, in a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nOn the same day, WHO’s Emergency Committee said Covid-19 remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — its highest level of alert, first declared on January 20, 2020 — amid rising cases, ongoing viral mutation and increasing pressure on already overstretched health systems. In a statement, the committee, which is made up of independent experts, highlighted challenges to the ongoing global Covid-19 response, including a drop-off in testing and spotty genome sequencing, raising the question of just how accurately any nation might reasonably be able to monitor BA.5.\n\nOfficial data dramatically undercount the true number of infections in the US, epidemiologists say, leaving the nation with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold. Some experts think there could be as many as 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population — 10 times higher than the official count.\n\nAs for how to manage the new wave, Jha urged Americans aged 50 and older to get second booster shots. Adults who are up to date with vaccinations are less likely to be hospitalized than those who are unvaccinated. But only about one in four adults in the US over 50 have gotten their recommended second boosters, data collected by the CDC show.\n\nUS health officials are urgently working on a plan to allow second Covid-19 boosters for all adults, a senior White House official confirmed to CNN on Monday, amid fears that younger adults’ immunity may be waning as Covid-19 cases rise with the dominance of BA.5.\n\nWhat makes BA.5 different? Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 “the worst version of the virus we’ve seen.” He explained in a recent newsletter: “It takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility,” well beyond earlier versions of Omicron.\n\nIn other words, BA.5 can easily evade immunity from previous infections and vaccines, increasing the risk of reinfection. Though the variant does not appear to lead to more severe illness, in an interview with CNN on Monday, Topol said that given the extent of BA.5’s immune evasion, he expects to see an escalation in hospitalizations, as we’ve seen in Europe and elsewhere that the variant has taken root. “One good thing is it doesn’t appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning,” he added.\n\nPublic health experts in the US may take some solace from the trajectory of the variant in Europe. WHO’s Ryan said last week that while many European countries are experiencing a jump in hospitalizations, “what we’re not seeing is an increase in intensive care unit admissions, so the vaccines are very much still working and it is those gaps in immunity that are causing the problem.”\n\nBut still, steep reductions in Covid-19 surveillance worldwide are hindering epidemiologists’ efforts as they race to trace the virus’ evolution.\n\n“Sub-variants of Omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalization and death around the world,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing on Tuesday. “Surveillance has reduced significantly – including testing and sequencing – making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures.”\n\n“New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the Covid-19 [pandemic] is nowhere near over,” he added.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: How should I protect myself amid the new Covid-19 wave?\n\nA: At this point in the pandemic, many people may not want to plan their lives around Covid-19 anymore — especially if they’re generally healthy. On the other hand, those with underlying health conditions or who have concerns about long-haul symptoms are still trying to play it safe. Given just how contagious the new Omicron subvariants are, avoiding infection does require some planning and consideration, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen explains.\n\n“I don’t think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting Covid-19 if they don’t take additional precautions,” Wen said. The question to ask yourself, she added, is this: How much do I want to continue to avoid infection?\n\nFor individuals who want to reduce their risk, Wen advises that they stay up to date with their boosters (in the US, everyone age 5 and older can receive a first booster, and those 50 and older can receive a second booster for a total of four shots). She also recommends wearing a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings, and staying outside for large gatherings as much as possible — something easier to do in the summertime.\n\n“For those who find masks uncomfortable, I’d encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings — for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning,” she said.\n\nSend your questions here.

Those who are “not suitable” for vaccination will be exempt from the requirement, a city official said, without clarifying how they can provide the proof needed for exemption.\n\nThe vaccine mandate comes as Beijing reported three cases of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant. Several Chinese cities have imposed new curbs after detecting BA.5. Shanghai, which only recently emerged from a two-month lockdown, identified its first case on Friday and will perform two rounds of Covid tests this week. An outbreak of BA.5 has already shut down the northwestern city of Xi’an, home to 13 million people, where entertainment, sports and religious venues have been closed, and restaurants limited to takeaway and delivery services.\n\nCasinos in the gambling hub of Macao were ordered to shut for the first time since February 2020 because of a Covid outbreak, sending shares of their operating companies plunging, and fears of new lockdowns in Shanghai undermined the broader China market. Chinese stocks remained under pressure after Monday’s sell-off fueled by the threat of new Covid restrictions, especially the tech sector, Laura He reports.\n\nPeople stand in line at a coronavirus testing site in Beijing on July 4. Andy Wong/AP\n\nDrug-resistant infections and deaths have risen among hospital patients\n\nThe US had made significant progress in fighting drug-resistant infections in recent years. But those gains were largely erased during the Covid-19 pandemic, with hospital-acquired infections and resulting deaths rising 15% in 2020, according to new data, Deidre McPhillips reports.\n\nA special report released Tuesday by the CDC found that more than 29,400 people died from antimicrobial-resistant infections in the first year of the pandemic — nearly 40% of those deaths were among people who got the infection while in the hospital. The full number is probably even higher, given that data for half of the 18 pathogens identified as threats are unavailable or delayed.\n\nWHO has called antimicrobial resistance a “silent pandemic,” and drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to the increased risk in the US, particularly because many people delayed care or left infections untreated — either because of closed clinics or fear of exposing themselves to Covid-19 — which can increase the risk of developing drug resistance.\n\nPulse oximeters don’t work as well for people of color\n\nOften when Dr. Thomas Valley sees a new patient in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, he clamps a pulse oximeter on their finger — one of the many devices he uses to gauge their health and what course of care they require, whether they are a child having seizures, a teenage car accident victim or an older person with Covid-19.\n\nBut recently, Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan’s Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, realized that the small device may yield less accurate oxygen readings in patients with dark skin. If the device isn’t calibrated correctly, the darker pigmentation can affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings and patients being discharged when they shouldn’t.\n\nThe findings of Valley and his colleagues add to a growing body of research – dating back to the 1980s – that suggests flawed pulse oximeter readings among Black and brown patients can be a real and life-threatening issue in medical care. But the public has only recently been made more aware of this health disparity, and US health officials have announced plans to investigate the accuracy of pulse oximeters, Jacqueline Howard reports.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nAdvice for anxious new moms\n\nEdith Bracho-Sanchez, director of pediatric telemedicine and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, didn’t think she’d be an anxious mom. But that changed when she had her son. “I stress over every decision I make for William. I make long pro and con lists, I discuss everything with my partner, sleep on things and ultimately, I pray,” she wrote in a recent column for CNN.\n\nKnowing how difficult it is to make decisions — big and small — she said she understood why some parents might struggle with the choice to vaccinate their children against Covid-19. This is why she says she did it, and her advice to anxious new moms like her:\n\nFirst, Covid-19 is an unpredictable illness. While most children have minor symptoms and recover well, many have landed in hospitals and emergency rooms, and to date, more than 400 children under the age of 5 have died from the illness in the US alone, according to the CDC. We also don’t yet fully understand the long-term effects of the disease.\n\nSecond, I know the vaccine is in the body for a short period of time and with a specific mission. It instructs the body to make protective antibodies against Covid-19, and the body’s own cellular mechanisms quickly break it down soon after. Because of this, there really is no plausible way it will interfere with my little William’s development, something about which I am constantly thinking.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR PODCAST\n\nWe’re always waiting for something, whether it’s in line for our morning coffee, on hold with customer service, or the next Covid-19 booster shot.

It closed for two weeks before the new semester starts Jan. 3.\n\n\"The overall feeling is one of exhaustion,\" Superintendent Astein Osei told the school board Nov. 23 before an unusual midyear vote to add two days to the holiday break.\n\nAcross the country, school districts and families are stumbling toward the finish line of a punishing semester. At some points, nearly all schools appeared back to normal with daily, in-person instruction. But disruptions abounded. COVID-19 exposures sent kids and staff home to quarantine. Teachers battled student misbehavior, from low-level defiance to fights, threats and gun violence. Staffing shortages shot up. Parents argued over race, public health and other issues.\n\nAnd now, omicron. As the country braces for an onslaught of infections driven by the more transmissible COVID-19 variant, schools and districts are shuttering and some are preparing to return to virtual instruction – the very mode of education this year was supposed to jettison.\n\n\"We're going to see a return, basically, to a good portion of how things looked last year,\" Dan Domenech, executive director of the School Superintendents Association, lamented on Monday.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the schools open,\" he said. \"The schools want to stay open. But it's a logistical nightmare. Depending on the infection rate in communities, it's going to be hard to do that.\"\n\nHow does omicron affect me? Don’t miss an update with the Coronavirus Watch newsletter.\n\nBack to online school\n\nOn Friday, Prince George's County School District in Maryland – one of the largest districts on the East Coast – announced a shift to virtual classes starting Monday until at least Jan. 18 because of an uptick in COVID-19 infections. That leaves more than 136,000 students without classroom contact for the next month.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called the move a terrible mistake. District CEO Monica Goldson said it allows school staff to deliver instruction while prioritizing their own health.\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, New York City and Erie, Pennsylvania, individual classrooms or specific schools are going virtual because of rising case counts.\n\nThe problem: Virtual learning doesn't work well academically, socially or emotionally for many students, particularly those who lack safe, supportive households and steady internet connections.\n\nBlack and Latino students, many of whom lacked robust education opportunities before the pandemic, have fallen further behind during long bouts of virtual instruction.\n\nPandemic first graders are way behind:Experts say they may take years to catch up.\n\n\"For the past year and a half, almost two years, our kids have been exposed to more trauma than ever before,\" said Tunette Powell, a mother of three children in Los Angeles and a diversity and inclusion expert.\n\n\"I work at a school that primarily serves wealthy families, and we're not talking about shutting down at all,\" Powell said. \"But if I was in South Los Angeles, where there are lots of communities of color, those discussions would already be happening.\"\n\nSome smaller districts and schools aren't going virtual – they're simply turning what would have been regular school days into vacation days.\n\n\"No school next week like originally planned,\" the Mendota School District in Illinois said last week when announcing an early start to the holiday break to keep staff and students safe.\n\nDistricts closing early for winter break are a small percentage of the overall school population, said Dennis Roche, whose company, Burbio, has tracked districts' responses to COVID-19.\n\n\"The bigger question will be what January looks like when all K-12 schools are set to return,\" he said Monday.\n\nThe pandemic changed American education overnight:Some changes are here to stay.\n\nDiscipline issues, mental health already a challenge\n\nFor many educators, the additional days off – or online, as the case may be – are welcomed as much for an emotional break as for physical safety.\n\nMisbehavior in schools as students readjust to classroom expectations has taxed teachers. Some districts closed for mental health days this fall.\n\n'Stretched too thin':Staff burnout has schools canceling class or going remote\n\nIn Denver Public Schools, fights increased 21% this fall compared with pre-pandemic times, district officials said.\n\nIn Akron Public Schools in Ohio, the teachers union sounded alarm bells last month over \"increased rates of highly concerning student behaviors,\" including more weapons on campus, threats and verbal and physical altercations.\n\nTeachers said they felt stuck in crisis mode.\n\nIn Washington, Angelina Zara, a fourth grade teacher, said students get frustrated with each other more quickly, and play soon turns to anger.\n\n\"Their lid will flip a little faster,\" she said.\n\nSchools are under unprecedented stress, which has caused a higher level of immature student behavior and a substantial increase in fighting, said Richard Welsh, a New York University professor who studies school discipline.\n\nDiscipline issues were rising before the pandemic. More than 80% of school administrators and 71% of teachers said disruptive behaviors in their schools increased from 2016 to 2019, according to one study.\n\nSchools are seeing a spike in youth mental health challenges as well. The issue was made worse by the \"stress brought on by COVID-19 and the ongoing struggle for racial justice,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics and groups that represent child psychiatrists and children's hospitals said in October.\n\nThis month, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a rare public health advisory spotlighting the youth mental health crisis.\n\nIn early 2021, emergency room visits for suspected youth suicide attempts were 51% higher for adolescent girls and 4% higher for boys compared with early 2019, the advisory said. Gun violence in schools reached record levels – twice as many shootings in schools this fall compared with before the pandemic.\n\nNot credible:TikTok rumors of school violence alarm people after Michigan shooting\n\nIncreasing kids' access to high-quality, culturally competent mental health care is key to addressing such crises, health officials said. Schools play a major role in that, but they've been stretched by staffing shortages and overwhelming demand.\n\n\"I have lines at my door,\" said Phyllis Fagell, a counselor at Sheridan School in Washington and a consultant on middle school behavior. \"The nurse does, too. We're constantly exchanging customers.\"\n\nHappy holidays. Are you vaccinated?\n\nAs challenging as the school environment may be, it's still the best place for students to receive academic, emotional and social support, health experts said.\n\n\"Going back to remote learning as a quick strategy only exacerbates the overall school climate and mental wellness of students and staff,\" said Sara Bode, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on School Health.\n\nSchools know what works to maintain in-person learning, she said: Vaccinate more staff and eligible students, wear masks and increase coronavirus testing.\n\nLA schools push off COVID-19 vaccine mandate:30,000 students were unvaccinated\n\nLast week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed a strategy called \"test to stay,\" which allows unvaccinated students to stay in school after an exposure, as long as they test negative for the virus at least twice within the week.\n\nParents should do their part during the holidays, said April Kapu, head of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. They should ask people they're gathering with if they're vaccinated or if they've tested negative before the occasion, Kapu said Monday in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThat might be an uncomfortable question, she said, but it's \"how we can get our kids’ lives back on track, even amid the spread of the Omicron variant.\"\n\nContributing: Alia Wong, USA TODAY; Jennifer Pignolet, Akron Beacon Journal; Madeline Mitchell, Cincinnati Enquirer; Megan Henry, Columbus Dispatch\n\nContact Erin Richards at (414) 207-3145 or erin.richards@usatoday.com.
