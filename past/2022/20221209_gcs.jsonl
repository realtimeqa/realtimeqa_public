The second thread looks at a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ+ events across the nation by domestic extremists.\n\nThe FBI and the NC State Bureau are assisting in the investigation.\n\ninvestigators have no evidence connecting the North Carolina attacks to a drag event at the theater in the same county, but the timing of two events are being considered in context with the growing tensions and armed confrontations around similar LBGTQ+ events across the country, the sources told CNN.\n\nIn the past two years, anti-government groups began using online forums to urge followers to attack critical infrastructure, including the power grid. They have posted documents and even instructions outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting the use of high-powered rifles.\n\nOne 14-page guide obtained by CNN cited as an example the 2013 sniper attack on a high voltage substation at the edge of Silicon Valley that destroyed 17 transformers and cost Pacific Gas and Electric $15 million in repairs.\n\nIn that case, the shooter fired more than 100 bullets in about 20 minutes, disappearing a minute before police arrived. The case remains unsolved.\n\nWhile investigators haven’t found a rifle in the North Carolina shootings, the casings still could offer critical evidence. A law enforcement source told CNN that the caliber of the bullets in the California incident is different from those used in North Carolina.\n\nInvestigators are taking into consideration that the timing of Moore County shootings – 7 p.m. on a Saturday night – coincided with the time a drag performance sponsored by the local LBGTQ+ community began, according to the sources. Audience members used their phone flashlights to light the stage for one last song, but after that the performance couldn’t continue due to the power outage, according to Sandhills PRIDE.\n\nOfficials have said the gunfire, which left much of the county without electricity for days, were a “malicious” and “intentional” attack. The two substations are about 10 miles apart.\n\nNo suspects in the outages have been announced.\n\nSheriff Ronnie Fields has said whoever fired at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing.” No group “has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it,” the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning there were 35,000 customers without power, but that number had decreased to 1,200 by the time a 4 p.m. news conference began, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. A few hours later the company’s website showed zero outages in the area.\n\nGiven the information, county officials said a nightly curfew will end for good at 5 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShell casings and bullets offer clues\n\nBullets recovered from the sites, and the brass shell casings found a short distance away, are the few pieces of physical evidence that investigators have.\n\nBecause of the heat generated in a high-powered rifle’s chamber during rapid fire, fingerprints are burned away – and nearly impossible to recover from spent casings. Still, the brass may offer valuable clues.\n\nInvestigators can enter the casings into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The database records three-dimensional images of shell casings and can match them to any other shell casings that may have been fired by the same gun at another crime scene or to the gun if the weapon is recovered.\n\nThe spot where the casings were found can give investigators a way to pinpoint the firing positions. Knowing where the shooter fired from could lead to discoveries such as shoe prints and tire tracks.\n\nResidents head to shelter for hot food and showers\n\nFor now, schools are closed through Thursday, many stores and restaurants are shut, homes are without heating or running refrigerators, drivers are traversing intersections with no traffic lights.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult with her 1-year-old child. CNN\n\nA Red Cross-run emergency shelter was set up at the Moore County Sports Complex to help provide shelter, food, showers and other services to people impacted. It will remain as a shelter through noon on Thursday, officials said.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult for her 1-year-old child.\n\n“No lights, no power, can’t really do nothing. The kid is scared of the dark,” she told CNN.\n\nJackson said sometimes she has to travel up to an hour one way to buy food. “It’s ridiculous. It should never have been done,” Jackson said.\n\nResidents who rely on electricity-powered medical equipment have also seen their lives upended. One woman told CNN she came to the shelter because she had no power for her CPAP machine at night.\n\nAfter two days of sleeping without it, she said she began to feel ill and came into the shelter for help.\n\nOthers have sought shelter fearing for their safety as they struggled to keep their homes warm.\n\n“It’s different. It’s kind of hard to sleep, you know. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be somewhere where it’s warm, where we have food, where we’re taken care of than to be somewhere it’s freezing cold,” said Amber Sampson.\n\nOn top of having to stay at the shelter, Sampson hasn’t been able to work since Sunday after her employer also lost power – an issue that could end up costing her hundreds of dollars.\n\nAuthorities have expressed anger over the attack, with Carol Haney, mayor of Southern Pines – a town of about 15,900 residents that completely lost power – calling it a cruel and selfish act.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper voiced concern over businesses and residents in nursing homes.\n\n“When we look at all the money that’s being lost by businesses here at Christmastime, when we look at threats to people in nursing homes having lost power, hospitals having to run off generators and not being able to do certain kinds of operations at this point – all of those are deep concerns here, and we can’t let this happen,” the Democrat told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community.”", "authors": ["John Miller Steve Almasy Whitney Wild", "John Miller", "Steve Almasy", "Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/20/ticket-scheme-fluoride-fiasco-swarm-bees-news-around-states/50856875/", "title": "Ticket scheme, fluoride fiasco: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican candidates continue to enjoy large cash advantages in competitive state legislative races, though Democrats are making pushes in contests in Montgomery and Huntsville. GOP nominees in 43 state House races with at least two candidates finished last week with a median of $69,471 in their war chests, according to reports filed with the Alabama Secretary of State’s office. Democrats in those races had a median of $8,083. In 16 races with two or more candidates in the Alabama Senate, GOP candidates ended last week with a median of $233,245 in their campaign funds. Democrats finished with $32,616. The Republican advantage includes incumbents enjoying the years-long osmosis of funding from powerful state groups and first-time candidates running in open seats. Rep. Arnold Mooney, R-Indian Springs, in north Shelby County outside Birmingham, finished with nearly $310,000 on hand. His Democratic opponent, Prince Cleveland, finished with $10,820. Brock Colvin, a financial planner running for an open seat in Marshall County, finished last week with $52,101 on hand. His Democratic opponent, Ben Alford, finished with $5,450.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy defended his record against sharp criticism from two major rivals during a televised debate Wednesday, arguing the state is “better off today than it was four years ago” under the administration of one of those challengers. Independent former Gov. Bill Walker, who held the office from 2014 to 2018, and Democrat Les Gara disputed Dunleavy’s characterization. Gara, a former state lawmaker, in response to questions frequently contrasted his positions to Dunleavy’s. Walker said Dunleavy had “taken a wrecking ball to our state,” referencing cuts to areas like the state ferry system. Walker also criticized Dunleavy for agreeing to participate in only a handful of debates ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Dunleavy, who faced a recall attempt earlier in his term fueled by public anger over vetoes and budget cuts he had proposed, said he’s been busy in his role as governor. “How many debates do you need to be able to get your point across?” he said. The fourth candidate, Republican Charlie Pierce, a former Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor, also participated. Issues discussed during the debate, which was broadcast on TV and radio and streamed, included the annual dividend paid to residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund, abortion and the state’s new ranked choice voting system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A former Phoenix Suns ticket office executive has been sentenced to one year in jail and three years of supervised probation in connection with a fraud scheme. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office said Jeffrey Allen Marcussen used his position with the team to sell unused Suns tickets on a third-party vendor site for his own profit. Marcussen, who worked for the NBA team for more than 15 years before his resignation, was found guilty of selling tickets for his own profit between August 2017 and February 2019. He was charged with one count of fraud schemes and artifices, one count of theft and two counts of false return in September 2020 and pleaded guilty in the case six months ago. Authorities said Marcussen received more than $458,000 from the tickets that were sold. They said he has fully repaid the Suns and paid the nearly $12,000 owed to the Arizona Department of Revenue for his 2017 and 2018 taxes.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Testifying at the nation’s first trial over a state ban on gender affirming care for children, 17-year-old Dylan Brandt said Wednesday that his life has been transformed by the hormone therapy he’s receiving and banning the treatment in Arkansas could force his family to leave. Brandt, his mother and the mother of another transgender child were among the final witnesses as opponents of Arkansas’ law wrapped up their case in federal court. Brandt and his mother said their family may have to move from their home in west Arkansas to another state if the law is upheld. “It would mean uprooting our entire lives, everything that we have here,” Brandt said. U.S. District Judge Jay Moody, who is hearing the case, last year temporarily blocked the law, which would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old. It also would prevent doctors from referring patients elsewhere for such care. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban on gender affirming care, with Republican lawmakers in 2021 overriding GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s veto of the legislation. Hutchinson, who had signed other restrictions on transgender youths into law, said the prohibition went too far by cutting off the care for those currently receiving it.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A woman was charged with using the names of convicted killers, including Scott Peterson, to collect more than $145,000 in fraudulent unemployment benefits – a small but headline-grabbing part of more than $20 billion stolen in similar scams during the coronavirus pandemic, prosecutors said Wednesday. Brandy Iglesias made her initial court appearance Wednesday on 10 charges including grand theft, forgery, identity theft and making false statements, the California attorney general’s office announced. Iglesias didn’t enter a plea. She was ordered held on $20,000 bail pending an Oct. 26 court date. An email seeking comment from her attorney, Ariana Alejandre, wasn’t immediately returned. One set of charges was for using Peterson’s name to claim $18,562 from the state Employment Development Department in June 2020. Peterson was convicted of murdering his pregnant wife and unborn child and dumping their bodies into San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002. But a judge is deciding whether Peterson must have a new trial because of juror misconduct. Iglesias is also charged with filing for unemployment in the name of Cary Stayner in 2020, collecting $20,194. Stayner confessed to killing three women who were sightseeing in Yosemite National Park in 1999. Peterson and Stayner were among numerous inmates who had claims filed in their names, prosecutors said in 2020.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: First-time and transfer students residing in the state have the opportunity to attend Colorado State University Pueblo tuition-free if their gross family income is $70,000 or less. Colorado Promise, a free-tuition enrollment initiative, was rolled out this fall to benefit students with gross family incomes of $50,000. Starting in the fall 2023 semester, the $50,000 maximum will be extended to $70,000. The decision to raise the maximum income was made after discussions between members of CSU Pueblo President’s Cabinet, said Kristyn White Davis, vice president for enrollment management and extended studies. In Pueblo County, the median household income is $49,979, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More than 65% of Pueblo households earn less than $60,000. Statewide, the median household income is $75,231. Tuition payments through Colorado Promise are guaranteed for at least one year and can be renewed up to four years for first-time, undergraduate students. Transfer students can have up to two years paid for. To be eligible for the Colorado Promise scholarship in fall 2023, students must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Colorado Application for State Financial Aid (CASFA) before May 1, 2023. Following an eligible student’s completion of the FAFSA or CAFSA, the Colorado Promise scholarship will pay for all tuition expenses not already covered by other federal, state or institutional grants and scholarships.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMorris: A bear that attacked a 10-year-old boy tested negative for rabies, a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said Wednesday, according to the Hartford Courant. The boy was attacked Sunday by a 250-pound black bear in his grandparents’ backyard, the news outlet reports. He has been released from the hospital and is recovering.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Delaware Superior Court judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked an effort to move state retirees to a Medicare Advantage health care plan. Judge Calvin Scott ruled that the state shall “take all necessary and proper steps” to ensure that retirees’ current health care insurance and benefits “remain in full force and effect.” A trial will be held to make a final determination on the future of the Medicare Advantage plan, the ruling stated. The temporary block is a major win for a group of state retirees, who have been protesting the switch in recent weeks. The deadline for the 30,000 state retirees to opt out of the Medicare Advantage plan, and as a result lose state-sponsored health care, was set for Oct. 24. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, argued that the state failed to follow administrative procedures when implementing the change, particularly regarding transparency and allowing retirees to offer input.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Officials say a suspicious vehicle was found near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. According to United States Capitol Police, officers saw a white van parked illegally on Capitol Grounds. Three people were detained after weapons were found in the van, according to the news outlet. Guns are prohibited on Capitol grounds, and police say “dozens” of people are arrested each year on suspicion of violating the law, WUSA-TV reports.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A U.S. Customs and Border Protection firearms instructor was shot and killed during a training class Wednesday morning at a South Florida gun range, officials said. The shooting occurred just before 11 a.m. at the Trail Glades Range in western Miami-Dade County, Miami-Dade police spokesman Angel Rodriguez said during a news conference. The agent was airlifted to a Miami trauma center, where he died from his injuries. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Michael Silva confirmed during the news conference that an agent had been assigned to the county-owned range as an instructor. Miami-Dade homicide detectives will investigate the shooting. Officials didn’t immediately identify the agent or release any details about how the agent was shot.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Wednesday made a campaign stop in downtown Athens alongside several other Democrats running for office this year. The rally drew about 200 supporters, most of them students at the University of Georgia. In addition to Abrams, speakers included candidates Janice Laws Robinson, Nakita Hemingway and Bee Nguyen. All four candidates spoke at length about the state of voting rights in Georgia. Nguyen, who is running for secretary of state, criticized Republican legislators’ passage of SB 202, which imposed tighter restrictions on absentee voting and dropbox availability, and banned offering food or water to voters waiting in line. In her speech, Abrams alluded to her first campaign for governor in 2018. The historic election was Georgia’s closest gubernatorial race in decades and saw record turnout. Though Abrams has acknowledged Kemp, then secretary of state, as the legal victor, she has maintained that the election was unfair. Early voting in Georgia opened on Monday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Continuing La Nina weather is expected to bring above average rainfall for parts of the state, but drought conditions could persist over some areas of the islands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s wet season outlook released Wednesday. La Nina, a cooling of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures near the equator, is expected to continue into the spring of 2023. A potential third year in a row of La Nina conditions during the wet season is unusual, said Kevin Kodama, a National Weather Service hydrologist in Honolulu. That has happened only twice before since 1950, he said. Climate models show above average rainfall, especially from December through April, but rainfall can be influenced by the strength of La Nina. While some parts of the state could get heavy rainfall, others can remain dry. Ranchers and farmers are hardest hit by Hawaii drought, as invasive Axis deer encroach upon pastures intended for livestock and eat produce, Kodama said. The worst impacts from drought last year were seen on Maui and the Big Island, with both islands experiencing significant brush fires. For Hawaii, NOAA said there is the possibility of drought continuing throughout the wet season, with recovery more likely this year on Kauai and Oahu. Still, flooding can happen, even in a drought, as intense storms come with heavy downpours.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little and other statewide elected officials have approved a northern Idaho conservation easement as part of a program that has protected from development about 156 square miles of private timberland. The Republican governor and other Land Board members on Tuesday unanimously approved the deal giving Idaho the easement title to 166 acres in northern Idaho under the federal Forest Legacy Program. In return for the easement, the non-industrial family landowner, Hartland LLC, will receive a $275,000 payment. That money comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a popular federal program that supports conservation and outdoor recreation projects across the country. The program is funded using royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling. In all, the Idaho easements open 140 square miles to the public in perpetuity for recreation, free of charge. “We’re going to get a lot more of these,” Little said immediately after the Land Board meeting. “The timber industry likes it, the conservation community, the hunters like it. The community likes it because they don’t get that fractured – people selling a little piece of property here, a little piece of property there, and putting houses on it.” The Hartland easement has an appraised value of 365,000. The Forest Legacy Program requires a non-federal cost share of 25%. Hartland donated about $91,000 of the land value as part of the deal. Tuesday’s action boosts the number of conservation easements purchased in Idaho to 44 at a cost of $42.5 million. The non-federal cost share for the easements was $24 million. Idaho officials say another 5 square miles conservation easements have been donated to Idaho with no payment required.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white woman charged with a hate crime following a confrontation where she told a group of Black men in 2020 that they couldn’t be at a suburban Chicago beach has been sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to a lesser charge. The felony hate crime charge Irene Donoshaytis had faced in Cook County was amended Wednesday to misdemeanor battery under a plea agreement. She pleaded guilty to the battery charge and was sentenced to one year of probation. The Northfield, Illinois, woman’s plea agreement includes a requirement that she attend an anti-racism class, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Donoshaytis, then 65, was accused in August 2020 of aggressively confronting Otis Campbell and two other Black men who were riding bicycles near a pier along Lake Michigan in Winnetka, police said. Campbell captured the interaction in a video that was uploaded to Twitter. In the video, Donoshaytis complains to a Winnetka Park District employee that the three Black men didn’t belong in a certain area without a pass. The employee responds that the men were on public property and a beach pass wasn’t required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A police officer accused of kicking a handcuffed man in the face during an arrest last year was indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury for alleged use of excessive force. The grand jury indicted Sgt. Eric Huxley, 44, on one count of deprivation of rights under color of law. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a statement Wednesday that Huxley was charged “with violating the civil rights of an arrestee by using excessive force.” The charge alleges that Huxley struck a person in the head and face, causing injury, while that person was handcuffed in September 2021, and that Huxley did so without legal justification. The federal charge contains no information about Huxley’s alleged victim. But Huxley was suspended without pay last year after body camera footage released by police showed him using excessive force against a man during the downtown Indianapolis arrest. Police Chief Randal Taylor recommended last year that Huxley, then a 14-year veteran of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, be dismissed. Online court records do not list an attorney for Huxley who could speak on his behalf. Huxley was charged by Marion County prosecutors with official misconduct and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury. That case is still pending. Court records detailing those charges said Huxley and two officers approached a man near the city’s Monument Circle after hearing him shouting. Officers asked the man to stop shouting, but after he refused he was handcuffed. After the man was taken to the ground on his back, the affidavit states that Huxley walked over, lifted his left leg and drove his left foot down into the man’s face. Police arrested the man on allegations of disorderly conduct and resisting law enforcement, and while charges were filed they were later dismissed, The Indianapolis Star reported.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Two teens were arrested Tuesday after a shot was fired at a park and a handgun was recovered outside Urbandale High School. At 12:20 p.m. Tuesday Urbandale Police Department officers responded to a single shot fired at Lion’s Park across from Urbandale High School, said department spokesperson Officer Holly Pickett in a news release. A 14-year-old and 15-year-old seen leaving the park were then seen outside Urbandale High and were arrested “within minutes” of the shot being fired, Pickett said in the release. A handgun was recovered from the 15-year-old, according to the release. The 15-year-old was charged with carrying weapons on school grounds and reckless use of a firearm. The 14-year-old was charged with being a minor armed with a dangerous weapon. No threats were made toward students or staff members at Urbandale High, Pickett said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kris Kobach, a Republican who helped lead Donald Trump’s short-lived presidential voter fraud commission, wants to rid his state of ballot drop boxes and says as he runs for attorney general that discounting talk of fraud is “ignoring reality.” The expanded use of drop boxes for mailed ballots in 2020 didn’t lead to any widespread problems, according to an Associated Press survey of state election officials across the U.S. that revealed no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have affected the results. And Kobach’s position puts him at odds not only with Democrats and voting-right advocates, but Kansas’ Republican secretary of state, Scott Schwab, who says the state’s elections are secure and drop boxes are safe. Kobach, who was secretary of state for eight years before Schwab, said Wednesday that allowing drop boxes prevents Kansas from enforcing a 2021 law against what Republicans call ballot “harvesting,” making it illegal for individuals to deliver ballots for more than 10 other people. Voting-rights advocates see the law as unnecessary for securing elections and contend it only hinders assistance to poor, minority and elderly voters. Kobach argued that with drop boxes, people can get a voter’s permission to deliver ballots and identify themselves on the ballot envelope with a false name and drop the signed enveloped in the drop box and officials can’t see that someone has delivered too many ballots. Election officials say the ballot would still be legal if the voter is properly registered and wanted to vote. “There are still other layers of protection, but it makes our anti-harvesting statute pretty, pretty weak when drop boxes can be used to circumvent it,” Kobach said.\n\nKentucky\n\nPikeville: Nine eastern counties will receive a total of $24.4 million in funding for economic development projects, Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers said. Funding from the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization Program will assist 11 projects, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Those projects are expected to retain or create more than 200 jobs, train 300 Kentuckians and serve more than 100,000 people through tourism, infrastructure development or training opportunities, it said. The state’s Democratic governor and Republican congressman made the announcement Wednesday. The projects are in Clay, Elliott, Floyd, Knox, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, McCreary and Wolfe counties. When completed, the projects will enable cold storage of bulk apples, broadcasting equipment at the Mountain Arts Studio, an emergency services center, a commercial driver’s license and diesel-mechanics training facility, RV and industrial parks, a resort bordering the Jefferson National Forest, a wastewater treatment plant and a visitors’ center.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three men imprisoned since the 1990s for a fatal drive-by shooting were ordered freed on Wednesday, their convictions vacated by a judge after prosecutors cited the involvement of two notorioulsy corrupt police officers in their case. Kunta Gable and Leroy Nelson were 17 when they were arrested shortly after the Aug. 22, 1994, shooting death of Rondell Santinac at the Desire housing development in the south Louisiana city. Also arrested with them was Bernell Juluke, then 18. The men were ordered released on Wednesday by a state judge who vacated their convictions, acting upon a joint motion by defense lawyers and District Attorney Jason Williams’ Civil Rights Division. The motion described numerous problems with the original case. Among them, it said, the state failed to disclose evidence undermining the case against the men. The motion also said the jury didn’t know that officers Len Davis and Sammie Williams – the first officers on the scene – were known to cover up the identity of perpetrators and manipulate evidence at murder scenes at the housing project to cover up for drug dealers they protected. Davis was later convicted for arranging the death of a woman who filed a complaint against him in an unrelated matter and is facing a federal death sentence. The motion also said the only witness to the shooting, Samuel Raiford, did not initially describe three suspects, adding, “the first time three perpetrators were mentioned by anyone is by Len Davis after the three defendants were pulled over.” The teens were arrested a short time after the shooting but there were no signs of guns or shell casings in their car, according to the 24-page motion. The prosecutor Williams said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon that there was extensive documented evidence of Davis’ illegal misconduct while operating “under color of law.”\n\nMaine\n\nMilo: A train derailed in rural Maine on Wednesday when it encountered a washout on the tracks. The train derailed east of Milo early in the morning, the Bangor Daily News reported. None of the four crew members who were aboard the Canadian Pacific Railway train were injured. Fire officials in Milo said three engines and six railcars were involved in the derailment. Heavy equipment will be needed to get the derailed engines and cars back onto the track, state officials said. One of the train cars was carrying tar and another was carrying carbon dioxide. Fire officials said inspections were ongoing to determine if there was a leak. Some diesel fuel leaked from a locomotive, but it was determined not to be a threat, officials said. Cleanup of the site will likely take two days.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will review about 100 autopsies of people who died in police custody involving physical restraint because of concerns about the state’s former medical examiner’s testimony in the death of George Floyd, the state’s attorney general said Wednesday. A team of forensic pathologists and behavioral scientists narrowed down the scope of the in-depth review after looking at about 1,300 autopsies conducted during the tenure of Dr. David Fowler, who testified for the defense at the 2021 murder trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. After Chauvin’s conviction in Floyd’s killing, medical experts raised concerns about the work of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in Maryland. Four-hundred such experts signed a letter to Attorney General Brian Frosh asserting that Fowler’s testimony deviated from standard medical practice in assessing cause of death and classifying the manner of Floyd’s death as “undetermined” rather than “homicide.” The letter called for an investigation to determine whether the office’s in-custody death determinations under Fowler’s leadership exhibited racial or pro-law enforcement bias or failed to follow appropriate practices and protocols, Frosh’s office said Wednesday in its announcement. Fowler was Maryland’s chief medical examiner from 2002 to 2019.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSpringfield: A woman who released a swarm of bees on sheriff’s deputies as they tried to serve an eviction notice is facing multiple assault and battery charges, authorities said. Rorie S. Woods, 55, pleaded not guilty at her arraignment on Oct. 12 in Springfield District Court and was released without bail, Masslive.com, citing court records, reported on Wednesday. She and other protesters maintain that they were trying to prevent a wrongful eviction. The homeowner, Alton King, brought evidence of a bankruptcy stay to court the next day, at which point “everything should have stopped,” said Grace Ross of the Massachusetts Alliance Against Predatory Lending. Woods’ lawyer did not immediately respond to a voicemail left by The Associated Press on Wednesday. Hampden County deputies were met by protesters when they went to the home in Longmeadow on the morning of Oct. 12, according to the official department report. Woods, who lives in Hadley, arrived in an SUV towing a trailer carrying bee hives and started “shaking” them, breaking the cover off one and causing hundreds of bees to swarm out and initially sting one deputy, according to the report. Woods, who put on a beekeeper’s suit to protect herself, was eventually handcuffed but not before several more sheriff’s department employees were stung, including three who are allergic to bees, the report said. When Woods was told that several officers were allergic, she said “Oh, you’re allergic? Good,” according to the report.\n\nMichigan\n\nOdessa Township: A man has been ordered to stand trial in the shooting of an 84-year-old woman who was canvassing door to door against a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion in the state. A judge issued the ruling Wednesday against Richard Harvey, 74, who is charged with assault and careless discharge of a weapon, WOOD-TV reported. Joan Jacobson was shot Sept. 20 at Harvey’s home in Odessa Township, a community about 130 miles northwest of Detroit. Jacobson told investigators that she was asking a woman at the home to vote against Proposal 3 in November when she was told to leave. Jacobson said she felt pain, drove to a local police station and was later treated at a hospital for a gunshot wound to her shoulder. Harvey told WOOD-TV that he shot Jacobson accidentally with a .22-caliber rifle while she was arguing with his wife and waving a clipboard. He said he told Jacobson numerous times to leave their property. Jacobson, a longtime volunteer for Right to Life of Michigan, said she never waved her clipboard. Abortion rights would be constitutionally guaranteed in Michigan if Proposal 3 passes on Nov. 8. A 1931 state law makes it a crime to perform most abortions, but the law was suspended in May and a judge this week struck it down as unconstitutional.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMorris: The vice chairman of the University of Minnesota Board of Regents has apologized for questioning whether declining enrollment at one college is due to its diversity. Steve Sviggum said in a statement issued late Tuesday that he’s willing to learn and must do better, referring to his comment about falling student numbers at the University of Minnesota, Morris. Sviggum said during a board meeting last week that he has received a couple letters from friends who decided not to attend Morris because it is “too diverse.” He said the prospective students “just didn’t feel comfortable there.” The release Tuesday from the board’s public relations office said Sviggum was “truly sorry” to those he offended. He added that his question was meant to encourage discussion about the enrollment, which is down 50% from its peak. “Let me unequivocally apologize for my questions, and especially for the unintended hurt my questions may have caused,” he wrote. “They were not intended to cause harm, but my intent does not matter.” Morris currently has 1,068 students enrolled. Of those, 54% are white and 32% are Native American. Overall, 41% are Black, Indigenous and people of color.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: The Mississippi River is approaching record low water levels in Vicksburg and Natchez amid a drought in the upper and middle Mississippi River region, according to the National Weather Service. The river level at Vicksburg was 1.29 feet at noon Wednesday but is projected to fall to lower levels throughout the week, according to the NWS. The Mississippi River level at Natchez was 10.93 feet at noon Wednesday but is projected to fall to approximately 10.4 feet by the end of the week, NWS officials said. The baseline for measuring the river is sea level. Low water along the river endangers barge traffic for one of the key shipping arteries in the nation. Marty Pope, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Jackson, said the drought began in the Missouri River and the upper and middle Mississippi River. “Most of the lower Mississippi River water droughts come from lack of water on the Ohio River Valley as well as in Missouri in the Upper Mississippi Valley,” Pope said. The river levels could possibly get as low as the levels in 2012, which were 7.66 feet at Natchez and -1.07 feet at Vicksburg in early August of 2012, Pope said. Officials said until decent rain falls across the valley, the water levels will get worse based on a 10-day weather forecast.\n\nMissouri\n\nRiverside: A school district faced a massive disruption after four freshmen students posted a “petition” that suggested restarting slavery, district officials said in a response to a federal lawsuit filed by the students’ parents. One student at Park Hill South High School was expelled and three others were suspended for 180 days after the petition was posted on social media in September 2021. In their federal lawsuit against the district, the students’ parents contend the petition began as “bantering” between freshmen football players – some of whom are biracial or Black – on a team bus. They contend the district overreacted to the incident and violated the students’ free speech and due process rights by removing them from school, The Kansas City Star reported Wednesday. In its response to the lawsuit, the district said it spent hundreds of hours counseling upset students and parents after the incident attracted national attention. The controversy delayed the district’s efforts to promote diversity and inclusion, took time away from teachers’ professional development and caused substitute teachers to refuse assignments at Park Hill South, according to the court records. Then-Superintendent Jeanette Cowherd said the petition “resulted in the most disruption she has experienced in her nearly 40 years in public education,” according to the court filing. The district asked the judge to deny the parents’ request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would allow the four students to return to school.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Two murder-suicides have been reported in the state in just over 24 hours, authorities said. A 39-year-old Billings man apparently killed a 38-year-old woman and an 11-year-old boy before killing himself on Wednesday night, police said. The shots were reported at about 8:30 p.m. The initial investigation indicates it was a double murder-suicide, Lt. Matt Lennick said in a statement. All three died at the scene. On Tuesday night about 10 miles south of Gallatin Gateway near Bozeman, a woman reportedly shot her husband and then killed herself at a nearby reservoir, Gallatin County officials said. A witness reported seeing the woman shoot her husband at about 6:45 p.m. and then leave the area. A person recreating at Hyalite Reservoir, about 17 miles south of Bozeman, found the woman’s body several hours later, the sheriff’s office said. The same gun appeared to be used in both shootings, Sheriff Dan Springer said. Springer identified the dead in the Gallatin County shootings as Jason Jones, 53, and Kimberli Jones, 50. The names of the victims in the Billings shooting have not been released.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Deputies seized more than 13 pounds of fentanyl pills worth more than $1 million during a traffic stop, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Authorities said the pills were discovered in a backpack after deputies stopped a speeding vehicle on Interstate 80. An Omaha man, 39, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to deliver narcotics, according to the news outlet.\n\nNevada\n\nNye County: Officials in the county will allow members of the public to view the hand-counting of mail-in ballots before Election Day if they sign a waiver promising not to release voting information early, the county said Wednesday in its response to a lawsuit asking the state Supreme Court to halt the county’s plan. Nye County’s 20-page statement filed in the Nevada Supreme Court came in response to an emergency petition by the ACLU’s Nevada chapter asking the court to bar the county’s controversial hand-counting process. The planned hand-count will take place alongside machine tabulators. The plan, which has the full support of the county commission, was put in place in response to false claims about Dominion voting machines that have spread throughout the county twice the size of New Hampshire. Nye County is one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. Nye County alleged that the ACLU’s argument rests on “speculation and a distorted view” of their process. The ACLU argued Nye County’s plan to start counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day risks the public release of early voting results. It alleges that county officials’ method of using a touch-screen tabulator for people with “special needs” illegally allows election workers to ask about a voter’s disability or turn away otherwise eligible voters based on “arbitrary decision making,” and that Nye County’s wording of “special needs” is ambiguous.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter: Some quick detective work has led to the recovery of more than $400 in field trip money that was stolen during a recent break-in at Lincoln Street School, according to police. The investigation into the missing money began when officers responded to the school on the morning of Oct. 13 after receiving a report of stolen cash and vandalism to two classrooms during the overnight hours. Police said a review of footage from school surveillance cameras showed two juveniles wearing dark hooded sweatshirts and face masks using a ladder to access the second floor around 1 a.m. The juvenile suspects were able to gain entry inside the school and take the money from one of the classrooms before fleeing on foot about a half-hour later, according to police. Through the investigation, police were able to identify the suspects, who are not students at the school. The suspects were cooperative and returned the stolen money, which had been collected from students, just in time for the field trip. The money is being used to send third-grade students to Applecrest Farm Orchards in Hampton Falls. Half of the grade took the trip Wednesday while the other half will go on Friday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: NJ Transit has agreed to update five of its train stations to make them more accessible for people with disabilities, according to a settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. The New Brunswick, Newark Penn, Princeton Junction, Metropark and Trenton train stations will receive wide-ranging improvements to bring these “intercity” stations into compliance with the federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The five stations identified by the U.S. Attorney’s Office are all considered wheelchair-accessible, but the 51-page settlement identifies more than 200 violations and fixes that must be made. “In ways large and small, people with disabilities were denied full access to transportation services – whether it was the lack of access to restrooms, no signs, bad ramps, poor access to elevators, or that parking spaces were just too small for those who needed wheelchair access,” the press release announcing the settlement said. NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith said about half of the issues identified by the U.S. Attorney’s Office have been taken care of; others require engineering and architectural review. “When DOJ contacted NJ Transit in early 2021 with ADA deficiencies, we moved quickly to implement remedies and add repairs to our capital improvement plans,” Smith said. “Over the past year, NJ Transit and DOJ worked together to develop solutions in line with the ADA to take corrective action.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Researchers at New Mexico State University are working to develop more nutritious and better-yielding chile pepper varieties to improve overall productivity in the nation’s top chile-producing state. Dennis Nicuh Lozada, the school’s chile pepper breeder and director of the Chile Pepper Breeding and Genetics Program, is leading the four-year project. It’s funded by a nearly $489,000 grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Lozada said the project’s goal is to develop chile pepper varieties with improved nutritional quality and yield through a deeper understanding of the genetic basis underlying these traits. Work on the project began this spring at NMSU’s Leyendecker Plant Science Research Center in Las Cruces. Lozada’s research team is using two novel genomic approaches – genome-wide association studies and genomic selection – to accelerate the selection, breeding and development of chile pepper varieties with improved nutritional content and yield. The researchers will first use genome-wide association studies to identify genetic markers linked with fruit morphology, nutritional content and yield in New Mexican chile peppers. They then will implement genomic selection for fruit morphology, yield and nutritional quality-related traits and evaluate the effects of different factors on genomic selection accuracy. Finally, the researchers will develop molecular markers that improve fruit morphology and nutritional content in chile peppers.\n\nNew York\n\nLarchmont: A man was convicted Wednesday of orchestrating the murder of his father in what prosecutors said was a plot to take over the older man’s lucrative real estate empire. A federal jury found Anthony Zottola Sr. and an associate guilty of conspiracy and murder-for-hire in the October 2018 killing of 71-year-old Sylvester Zottola, who was shot was he waited to pick up a cup of coffee at a McDonald’s drive-thru in the Bronx. Anthony Zottola also tried unsuccessfully to have his brother, Salvatore Zottola, killed, according to prosecutors. Both men face mandatory life terms after the guilty verdict in the six-week trial. The killing of Sylvester Zottola culminated what prosecutors said was a yearlong series of bungled attempts by hired killers to rub out both him and Salvatore Zottola, at the behest of Anthony Zottola. Sylvester Zottola was threatened by a masked gunman in late 2017 and later survived being stabbed and having his throat slashed. Salvatore Zottola was shot in the head, chest and hand in front of his residence but survived, according to prosecutors. Himen Ross, who was convicted Wednesday on the same counts as Anthony Zottola, tailed the elder Zottola to the McDonald’s with the help of a tracking device placed in his car and shot him multiple times, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. Five other defendants have pleaded guilty, including Bushawn Shelton, who prosecutors alleged was hired by Anthony Zottola and then engaged Ross to carry out the hit. Another man, Alfred Lopez, was acquitted on all counts Wednesday. Anthony Zottola, 44, of Larchmont, helped manage properties for his father’s real estate business, which consisted of multi-family rental properties valued in the tens of millions of dollars. Prosecutors alleged the business was built on illegal gambling proceeds connected to the mob.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLaurinburg: A South Carolina-based food processor known for supplying U.S. military combat rations will build a facility in North Carolina, creating 440 jobs in a county with one of the state’s highest jobless rates. SO-PAK-CO Inc. and Gov. Roy Cooper announced on Tuesday the company’s $85 million investment in a new processing and packing operation in Laurinburg. The new positions, which include managers, operators and administrative personnel, will have an average salary of more than $45,000, which is above the countywide average in Scotland County of $40,894, according to a news release from Cooper’s office. Scotland County’s 7.7% unemployment rate for August, as reported by the state Commerce Department, was the second highest among the 100 North Carolina counties. SO-PAK-CO is a leading company in producing shelf-stable, ready-to-eat meals. It provides food-processing services to federal, state and local agencies as well as commercial retail customers, Cooper’s news release said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A small explosion and fire disrupted care on the third floor of a hospital. Officials say firefighters were called to Trinity Hospital shortly before 2 p.m. Tuesday where the explosion and subsequent fire and smoke caused patients and staff to evacuate the third floor. Firefighters knocked down the flames and contained the fire to an area around an electrical panel. The fourth, fifth and sixth floors were checked before the hospital was returned to the building superintendent. No one was injured. Three engines, one ladder truck, two command vehicles, and two support vehicles responded to the incident, with a total of 16 firefighters and five support staff responding.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A community is mourning a youth football coach who was killed in a shooting after practice had finished. Jermaine Knox, 37, died at the scene outside the College Hill Recreation Facility on Tuesday night, police said. Another man was wounded in the leg and was taken to a hospital. Practice had just broken up. No children were injured. Knox coached the Trojan Black team. During a memorial service on Wednesday night, he was remembered by other coaches and players as a mentor to many children in the community. “He was out here because he knew these kids needed him,” Pastor Peterson Mingo said. Mingo led a brief prayer before balloons were launched in Knox’s honor. It was not clear what led to the shooting. Police were seeking a suspect, but they had little information to go on. They encouraged community members to come forward.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMcAlester: The state executed inmate Benjamin Cole on Thursday morning despite claims from his attorneys that he had been severely mentally ill. Cole was pronounced dead at 10:22 a.m. at Oklahoma’s state penitentiary in McAlester. He was the sixth Oklahoma inmate to be executed since the state resumed carrying them out in October 2021. Attorneys for Cole did not dispute that he killed his infant daughter, 9-month-old Brianna Cole. But they argued that Cole was severely mentally ill and that he had a growing lesion on his brain that had worsened in recent years.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: Dozens of vehicles, including semitrailers, were involved in a deadly crash in heavy fog Wednesday on Interstate 5. One person was killed in the multi-vehicle crash that happened in the southbound lanes of the interstate north of Eugene, Oregon State Police told KOIN-TV. About 60 vehicles, including up to 20 semitrailers, were involved in the crashes Wednesday morning that spanned more than a mile and led to the closure of that part of the interstate. The Department of Environmental Quality responded to address leaking fluids from six of the semitrailers, police said. School buses from Eugene were reportedly sent to take several dozen stranded motorists to a nearby truck stop. Authorities believe the fog led to the crash, police said. Transportation officials said later the interstate closure in the area had expanded because of two more multi-vehicle crashes Wednesday afternoon. “BE PATIENT & SLOW DOWN,” transportation officials said in a tweet. Traffic was diverted to Highway 99E and drivers were urged to use other routes.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nScranton: Federal prosecutors have accused a prison escapee of sending a letter with threats to kill President Biden and the chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, among others, and containing a white powder with an allusion to anthrax. Robert Maverick Vargo, 25, of Berwick is charged with making threats against the president and a federal official and with interstate communications with a threat. The U.S. attorney’s office in Scranton said the Washington office of U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., received a letter Oct. 11 threatening him, the president and a federal judge, and referencing Thompson’s role as chairman of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Prosecutors said the letter “alluding to ‘anthrax’ ” contained a white powder that U.S. Capitol Police determined did not pose “an immediate public safety hazard.” Prosecutors allege that both letter and substance were sent from the Luzerne County Correctional Center in Wilkes-Barre. Vargo made headlines over the summer when he ran away from a clean-up detail operated out of the Luzerne County jail’s minimal offenders unit on July 17. Federal marshals recaptured him days later near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Court documents indicate that Vargo pleaded guilty to an escape charge Friday in Luzerne County and awaits sentencing Dec. 27. A message was left Wednesday for the attorney representing him. He was also awaiting trial on burglary, weapons and other counts in Columbia County; his attorney in that case declined comment. Federal court documents don’t list an attorney for him and the federal public defender’s office said it had not yet been contacted about representing him; listed numbers in his name were no longer in service Wednesday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Rhode Island residents who buy electric bicycles will soon be eligible for rebates under a program announced on Wednesday and named in honor of a former Associated Press reporter. The $250,000 Erika Niedowski Memorial Electric Bike Rebate Program will offer rebates of up to $1,000 or 75% of the final purchase price, whichever is less, to low- and moderate-income residents, and rebates of up to $400 or 30% of the final purchase price of the bicycle, whichever is less, for other residents, according to the office of Gov. Dan McKee. Niedowski, a former journalist for The Associated Press and a Pulitzer Prize finalist for The Baltimore Sun, died in October 2020 after a sudden illness. She was 46. Niedowski, who was also director of communications for McKee while he was lieutenant governor, was an advocate for renewable energy and environmental justice and loved donning her favorite hoodie and taking off on her bike. Applications for the rebate program will be available online at www.drive.ri.gov starting Oct. 24. The bikes must be purchased in Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina Supreme Court convened Wednesday to see whether the state violated the constitution and the privacy rights granted by it after it passed the controversial six-week abortion ban last year. The law, which bans abortions six weeks after conception, with exceptions for pregnancies arising from rape, incest and in cases of fetal anomalies and danger to a woman’s life, is temporarily blocked until the court considers its fate. But it’s at the crucial juncture of going beyond reproductive rights and into the sphere of contraception and same-sex marriage that are guarded by privacy rights.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The U.S. Department of Justice sued the owners of a hotel on Wednesday, alleging that they violated the civil rights of Native Americans by trying to ban them from the property. The Justice Department alleges that on at least two occasions in March, Connie Uhre and her son Nicholas Uhre committed racial discrimination by turning away Native Americans who sought to book a room at the Grand Gateway Hotel. Connie Uhre had also told other Rapid City hotel owners and managers that she did not want Native American customers there or in the hotel’s bar, the Cheers Sports Lounge and Casino. A post on her Facebook account said she cannot “allow a Native American to enter our business including Cheers.” Uhre’s comments and actions, which followed a fatal shooting involving two teenagers at the hotel, sparked large protests in Rapid City and condemnation from the city’s mayor, Steve Allender. Nicholas Uhre said he and his mother had been under pressure from the Justice Department to enter a consent decree settling the matter, but there were “sticking points” in the negotiation. “I guess they are going to do what they are going to do,” he said. The Justice Department sued under a section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that permits a judge to order changes to policies and practices at hotels and other venues, but does not allow the department to obtain monetary damages for customers who are victims of discrimination. “Restricting access to a hotel based on a person’s race is prohibited by federal law,” U.S. Attorney for South Dakota Alison J. Ramsdell said in a statement.\n\nTennessee\n\nBean Station: A federal judge gave preliminary approval Wednesday to a settlement that would provide more than $1 million to workers at a meat processing plant that was the subject of an immigration raid in 2018. The Southern Poverty Law Center and National Immigration Law Center said at the time the raid at the Southeastern Provision Plant in Bean Station, Tennessee, was the largest workplace raid in nearly a decade. The plaintiffs, approximately 100 workers who were detained during the raid, alleged U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Internal Revenue Service officers illegally targeted them. U.S. District Judge Travis R. McDonough of the Eastern District of Tennessee preliminarily approved the settlement and set a final approval hearing for Feb. 27. The case, which alleged unlawful policing and racial profiling, was certified as a class action in August. Class members would receive a total of $550,000 under the settlement. The United States would also be required to pay $475,000 to six individual plaintiffs to resolve claims including excessive force and unlawful arrest, as well as $150,000 in attorneys fees and expenses. “This settlement marks a historic moment for immigrant workers in America,” said Meredith Stewart, senior supervising attorney, Southern Poverty Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Project. “The Latinx workers took a stand against federal agents targeting them because of their ethnicity.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Austin’s boom is far from over, as a new report says the metro area has the second-fastest-growing economy in the country. Austin’s estimated regional gross domestic product – the total value of goods and services produced in one year – increased by 4.3% this year, second only to San Francisco’s growth at 4.8%, according to the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. The report is the institute’s first as a part of its American Growth Project, which aims to provide “up-to-the-minute” economic data for the microeconomies of towns, cities and counties across the country. Equating to $216 billion, Austin’s GDP ranks as the 22nd-largest in the country, according to the report. And while cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas have larger GDP outputs, only Austin and San Francisco grew by more than 4% during the year, with Seattle coming in third at 3.5%, according to the report. Citing the growth of tech giants Oracle, Tesla, Google and Amazon in Austin, the report points to continued favorable conditions in the area for growth with a “high concentration of venture capital, warm climate and vibrant cultural offerings.” In addition, Samsung’s efforts to invest in the area, along with a growing push to increase microchip manufacturing in Central Texas, create potential for continuing economic and industry growth.\n\nUtah\n\nHill Air Force Base: An F-35 fighter jet crashed Wednesday at an Air Force base, officials said, adding that the pilot ejected and was taken to a hospital for observation. The 388th Fighter Wing said on its Twitter account that the F-35 A Lightning II crashed at the north end of the Hill Air Force Base runway. It said the cause of the crash was unknown and would be investigated. The 388th Fighter Wing said emergency crews both on and off the base responded to the crash. Brock Thurgood said the pilot landed near his property near the base, KSL.com reported. Thurgood said the pilot was “walking and he was coherent,” but noted his hands were “bloodied up and he was a little banged up.” “I don’t know how I’d be after I was in a plane crash but he was surprisingly tough,” Thurgood said. Hill Air Force Base is located about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: A town employee who quietly lowered the fluoride in a community’s drinking water for years has resigned – and is asserting that the levels had actually been low for much longer than believed. Richmond water superintendent Kendall Chamberlin disclosed in his five-page resignation letter, submitted Monday, that fluoride levels have not been in the state-recommended range for over a decade – instead of nearly four years, as the state had recently disclosed. Chamberlin said in his letter – in language that at times echoes unfounded reports that have circulated online in recent years – that he doesn’t think the current fluoridation policy is legally required or scientifically sound, and, in his opinion, poses “unacceptable risks to public health.” Chamberlin wrote that he has never received a negative job review, has each day accurately measured the fluoride levels in the water, and has provided monthly written reports that were approved and signed by the town manager and submitted to two state agencies. He contends that fluoridation is voluntary and that the amounts are not mandated. While fluoridating municipal water is voluntary, towns that do must maintain levels within the state’s recommendations and submit monthly reports to the state Health Department, according to state officials. The Vermont Health Department did not immediately return an email seeking comment on Chamberlin’s resignation or his new assertions about the length of time fluoride levels have been out of range.\n\nVirginia\n\nWaynesboro: Despite having a scant initial description of “Black males wearing black,” a deputy sheriff was justified in detaining two men believed to be involved in a home-invasion robbery 21/ 2 years ago in Waynesboro, the state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday. In two separate opinions, the court denied appeals from Arun Rashid Turay and Justice Ahmed Carr that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when they were stopped by Deputy Cody Stroop. They claimed Stroop was not justified in holding them just because they were Black men walking in a neighborhood close to where a burglary and robbery had been reported. Turay claimed that the stop was “premised on nothing more than Stroop’s hunch and was unjustified because the description of the suspects was too vague and not particularized as to him,” according to his complaint. Carr called the stop “not supported by reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they were involved. Both of their claims were denied last year by a Waynesboro Circuit Court judge. In its opinion Tuesday, the appellate court affirmed that denial, saying that it was “reasonable” for the deputy to conclude “that a group of robbers might separate upon leaving the scene of their crime, either to help avoid detection or simply because they had differing destinations.” The robbery happened Feb. 7, 2020, at a mobile home in the 1100 block of Ohio Street. According to reports, a 19-year-old man and 18-year-old woman were pistol-whipped after three suspects invaded the residence in search of cash and drugs. After taking some debit cards, the suspects fled the scene. The third suspect was never caught.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A police student officer has been charged with cyberstalking for allegedly harassing a woman online. The Seattle Times reports Jafar Al-Salehi is accused of sending messages and texts to the woman from November 2021 into August 2022, according to a criminal complaint. The cyberstalking charge is a gross misdemeanor. It wasn’t immediately known if Al-Salehi has a lawyer to comment on the case. Al-Salehi, 22, is still in his probationary period within the department’s field training program. He has been placed on unpaid leave, police said Wednesday. Al-Salehi first messaged the woman through a dating app on Nov. 8, 2021, according to charges filed by the Seattle City Attorney’s Office. They met a West Seattle diner Nov. 11 and the woman later went with him to his home, where he insisted on showing her his badge and firearm, according to the charges. The woman decided to not continue seeing Al-Salehi, the charges say. She told police that he continued to send her messages via Instagram and when she blocked him, he created another account, according to the charges. Al-Salehi also sent her messages on Facebook, followed by messages on OKCupid to apologize for being “rude,” charging documents say. The woman told police he kept sending messages and then received a text from Al-Salehi although she never gave him her phone number, according to the charges. She told police she was worried about Al-Salehi’s access to a firearm, the charges say.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new Family Court circuit judge has been appointed to serve in Berkeley and Jefferson counties. Gov. Jim Justice appointed Lyndsey Matschat of Martinsburg to the post, the governor’s office said Wednesday. Matschat replaces Judge Sally Jackson, who retired. Matschat has spent her career in public service, most recently in the Jefferson County prosecutor’s office, Justice’s office said. She is a graduate of Shepherd University and received her law degree from Penn State.\n\nWisconsin\n\nNekoosa: A doctor and a dentist from Nekoosa, near Wisconsin Rapids, say they’ve been robbed of their opportunity to market an infant formula made from Wisconsin goat’s milk. Nikos Linardakis, a medical doctor, says the federal Food and Drug Administration has stymied efforts that he and dentist James Esselman have made to launch their Bene Baby Co.’s product, even as the agency has relaxed its oversight of imported formula following a severe national shortage. Since February, the U.S. has turned to overseas manufacturers to boost infant formula supplies. The FDA granted the foreign companies three years to become fully compliantwith federal standards in areas like nutrition, labeling and manufacturing. However regulators failed to grant Bene Baby Co. the same pathway to the marketplace, leaving it stuck on the sidelines. Linardakis, a physician and medical books author, said he created an infant formula that’s similar to human breast milk and doesn’t have corn syrup that’s in some other formulas. His product is based on powdered goat’s milk, and he said it would meet FDA nutrition and ingredient requirements. The FDA, in an Aug. 9 letter to Linardakis, said it identified “one or more” issues for why Bene Baby wasn’t granted immediate access to the marketplace like its foreign competitors were given. “We believe these issues would be unlikely to be resolved quickly and, therefore, we are deferring further consideration of your request at this time,” the letter said. While the FDA cited some possible reasons for why Bene Baby wasn’t given approval, such as nutrition, ingredients, or labeling, it didn’t say which of them actually applied. The agency sent a similar letter to some other U.S. manufacturers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A parent raised concerns to her son’s high school after a Ku Klux Klan photo was displayed in a classroom, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. According to the news outlet, an English teacher at Central High School displayed a picture of three individuals dressed in KKK robes, driving a carriage with a parade float behind them. The teacher said the photo was for education purposes, according to the news outlet. Administrators removed the photo from the classroom.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/31/governors-ball-tabernacle-theft-witch-pardon-news-around-states/50305421/", "title": "Governor's ball, tabernacle theft: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An attorney for an inmate who was the subject of a national manhunt after escaping with the apparent help of a jail official said he will ask to move his trial to another city. Mark McDaniel, an attorney representing Casey White, said he will seek a change of venue to move his upcoming capital murder trial and the separate escape case to a new location. When Casey White disappeared with jailer Vicky White, he was awaiting trial on a charge of killing a woman in 2015.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration is suing the state over fishing rights on a river that runs through a national wildlife refuge, saying Alaska is undermining federal efforts to limit harvests when fish numbers are low to residents in the area of predominantly Indigenous villages. U.S. Interior Department spokesperson Melissa Schwartz said the openings violated federal law and interfered with a priority for rural subsistence use under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey is in Israel for five days of talks with political and business leaders. Ducey arrived in Israel on Sunday morning, accompanied by the heads of the Arizona Commerce Authority and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ducey spokesperson C.J. Karamargin said the Republican governor’s meetings would focus on trade, water and border security. Ducey has worked over his seven years in office to boost economic ties with Israel, which has a similar arid climate and water and security issues. His plans included meeting with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and President Isaac Herzog, as well as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also was slated to meet with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Thomas Nides; pay a Memorial Day visit to Israel’s 9/11 memorial in Jerusalem; meet with the city’s mayor; and visit some historic sites.\n\nArkansas\n\nCharleston: The city honored the 1954 integration of its school district – the first public district to do so in the South – with a memorial celebrating the July 27, 1954, decision to desegregate Charleston Public Schools. The decision followed the May 17, 1954, U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which determined that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. On Aug. 23, 1954, 11 Black students – three ninth graders and eight elementary school children – attended class alongside 480 white students. Barbara Dotson was one of the 11 Black students to attend school alongside white students. She became the first Black female student to graduate from the Charleston School District.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A school district has been unable to identify who subjected a Black assistant principal to racist graffiti and messages on social media even after a six-month investigation in which 45 witnesses were interviewed. Elysse Versher, assistant principal at the West Campus High School, told The Sacramento Bee she planned to resign, saying the Sacramento City Unified School District failed to protect her from the harassment and does not take incidents of racism and hate crimes seriously. Versher was made aware in November of social media posts by students calling her racial slurs and criticizing her enforcement of school dress codes. She found racist graffiti painted on a wall across from her parking spot. West Campus is a public college prep school for academic achievers. The school’s dress code states that students cannot wear clothing that promotes violence, drugs or alcohol or hate speech. Students cannot wear helmets or hoods that obscure the face unless required by the student’s religious practices. Versher said back in November that she has been disrespected and even threatened by parents of non-Black students and that non-Black students do not respect her authority. “They do not respect me as a human being,” she said. District officials expressed frustration over the results of their investigation.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Mountain National Park: A climber was killed and two others were injured Sunday after a rock fall and avalanche in Rocky Mountain National Park, officials said. A woman suffered minor injuries, and a man who suffered more serious injuries was rescued by a Colorado National Guard helicopter using a hoist during a break in wintry weather, a park press release said. The park’s search and rescue team was looking for another man who was with the other two climbers near the Dreamweaver Couloir on Mount Meeker at the time of the avalanche Sunday morning, it said. Search crews found his body in avalanche debris about 5:15 p.m. Sunday, park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said. The identities of the victims were not immediately released. The avalanche was witnessed by climbers in the area.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The nation’s energy secretary and Danish wind developer Orsted say they want American union workers to build offshore wind farms to dot U.S. coastlines – the building trades workers who could otherwise be left out of a transition to renewable resources. The Biden administration wants to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, generating enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm visited the New London State Pier facility this month to see how Orsted, energy provider Eversource and the state of Connecticut are transforming it into a hub for the offshore wind industry. At a press conference afterward, the Democratic governor and Democratic congressmen spoke about creating American jobs – messaging that will surely play into their reelection campaigns. Gov. Ned Lamont said there are “hundreds of good paying jobs right here,” and “we’re just getting started.” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal thanked the unions, saying that “this is the future of energy in the United States of America right here.” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney said they’re maximizing every opportunity for the state to grow in a sustainable way. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, the only one not up for reelection, echoed the same message, saying offshore wind is the “holy grail of public policy” because it creates jobs, helps the local economy, makes the country more secure and helps save the planet.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State House leaders chastised a fellow Democrat who suggested in an online discussion that those who don’t support mask-wearing amid an uptick in COVID-19 cases but do support gun rights should kill themselves with their firearms. House leaders gave no indication, however, that they want to pursue formal disciplinary action against Rep. John Kowalko, who made the comment in a post following last week’s Texas school shooting but later deleted his Facebook comments and apologized. Kowalko, a Newark Democrat who once described himself as “your textbook liberal, progressive Dem,” made the remark about guns last week in an online back-and-forth with a conservative commenter over whether people should wear masks. Delaware House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Majority Whip Larry Mitchell said in a joint statement released Friday that Kowalko’s comments were “offensive and indefensible.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro riders who take the Orange Line will have to deal with several station closures as crews work on reconstruction and improvements, WUSA-TV reports. The closures, which began Saturday, are expected to last more than three months. According to a release from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the closures will affect the New Carrollton, Landover, Cheverly, Deanwood and Minnesota Avenue stations until Sept. 5. WMATA said free shuttle bus services along three routes and free parking for Metro customers at the closed stations will be available. The closures are part of Metro’s “Platform Improvement Project,” which aims to reconstruct the aging concrete platforms at 20 stations. WMATA said 17 stations have completed the renovations over the past 21/ 2 years.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: There’s nothing to indicate the Florida Department of Health told an employee to falsify COVID-19 data, and she wasn’t fired out of retaliation, according to a state investigator’s report released this month. Former department employee Rebekah Jones received national attention when she raised questions about the state’s COVID-19 dashboard and claimed she was fired for exposing problems. The state said she was fired for insubordination after being reprimanded several times. An inspector general’s 268-page report found no evidence of wrongdoing or retaliation by the department. Jones, a Democrat who is running for the U.S. House seat now held by Republican Matt Gaetz, is also facing criminal charges after authorities said she illegally accessed the Department of Health’s computer system to send a message to 1,750 people and downloaded confidential data and saved it to her devices.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Workers cooking burgers and tater tots in a Sonic fast-food kitchen fled after discovering a nonvenomous ball python hiding behind the deep fryer. Police Lt. Matthew Wilson found employees of the Sonic drive-in huddled in the parking lot when he arrived to investigate May 21. On the phone, they described the culprit as brown with diamonds on its back. “When I saw it, I could tell it was just a ball python and not a rattlesnake,” Wilson told The Brunswick News. He not only removed the large snake but also found it a new home with a friend who has a large terrarium and a fondness for snakes. Wilson said the python likely slipped into the Sonic’s kitchen through an open back door, finding a cozy spot for its cold-blooded body behind the hot fryer. Police don’t know where the snake came from, though Wilson said it had likely been a pet that got turned loose by its owner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A contractor hired by the Navy is recommending a series of structural repairs to a massive fuel tank farm at Pearl Harbor to make sure the facility doesn’t leak petroleum when its tanks are drained, a report released Friday said. The recommendations for the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility came after the complex’s pipes leaked fuel into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, sickening thousands of military families. The Pentagon has since agreed to comply with a state order to drain the tanks and permanently shut them down. The Navy has a June 30 deadline to inform the state Department of Health when and how it plans to drain the fuel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A woman charged with killing her two youngest children and her new husband’s previous wife will be tried alongside her husband, and their trial has been delayed until early next year because the judge said that will give her attorneys enough time to effectively prepare a defense. Judge Steven Boyce ruled that delaying Lori Vallow Daybell’s trial another 90 days to Jan. 9 would not violate her rights for a speedy trial. Vallow and her husband, Chad, have pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if they are convicted.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The discovery of the bodies of three women inside a senior housing facility this month left the city looking for answers to questions that were supposed to be addressed after a far longer, hotter heat wave killed more than 700 people nearly three decades ago. The city is facing the reality that because of climate change, deadly heat waves can strike just about anywhere, don’t only fall in the height of summer, and need not last long. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office has yet to determine the causes of death for the three women whose bodies were found in the James Sneider Apartments on May 14. But the victims’ families have already filed or plan to file wrongful death lawsuits against the companies that own and manage the buildings. It took the sight of refrigerated trucks being filled with dead bodies after Chicago’s 1995 heat wave to drive home the message that the city was woefully unprepared for a silent and invisible disaster that took more than twice as many lives as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. That realization led to a system in which city workers call the elderly and frail and turn city buildings into 24-hour cooling centers when temperatures become oppressive. What happened this month is a reminder that the type of safeguards in place to make sure people don’t freeze to death because they have not paid their heating bills often do not exist to prevent people from overheating in their homes.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: An agreement that will bring $75 million over the next 10 years to Purdue’s West Lafayette campus has officially been signed between the university and Rolls-Royce. Backed up by over 70 years of partnership, the relationship between Purdue and Rolls-Royce has been highlighted through millions of dollars invested in aerospace testing technology, graduate student research fellowships, and 600-plus Purdue alumni in Rolls-Royce’s workforce, according to a release from the university. The funds from this agreement will go toward gas turbine and electrical and digital technology research, with most of the investment going towards Zucrow Laboratories. In April, Purdue also announced plans for a $73 million, 55,000-square-foot propulsion laboratory for hypersonic technologies in Purdue’s Discovery Park District. “Purdue’s research partnership with Rolls-Royce will address some of the greatest technology challenges facing the U.S,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said in the release. “Our faculty and students will work on advanced technology capabilities to ensure long-term national security. This will enhance the university’s role as a world leader in engineering research.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Families could soon be able to open-enroll their children in other school districts at any point during the year after the Legislature passed a bill last week that removes a March 1 deadline. Republicans framed the legislation as a way to give parents more choice about how their children are educated, while Democrats said it could undermine school districts’ ability to set a budget by April 15 every year, as they are required to do by law. The change was passed as part of the final budget bill of the year. The last-minute push to expand open enrollment in Iowa came after Republicans’ education agenda for the year largely collapsed. Just before the annual legislative session adjourned, House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Harford, said House Republicans lacked the votes to pass a proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds that would have given families taxpayer-funded scholarships to pay private school expenses. Other GOP-backed policies that would have required schools to post their curriculum and library books online also fell by the wayside before the legislative session ended early Wednesday morning. Throughout the legislative session, Republicans have criticized school districts around the state for policies with which they say parents disagree, which they say show parents need other options.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Visitors to the Statehouse will soon be able to honor Gold Star families who have lost a family member in the line of military duty. Senate Bill 330 authorizes the construction of a memorial honoring Kansas Gold Star families. It passed the Legislature unanimously and was signed by Gov. Laura Kelly. The Capitol Preservation Committee is tasked with approving plans for a permanent memorial on Statehouse grounds. The monument will be on the Veterans’ Walk along the sidewalk at the southwest entrance. Public funds cannot be used for the project, which will depend on gifts and other funding.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Incoming high school seniors who have previously taken the ACT will be eligible to retake the standardized test for free, Gov. Andy Beshear said. A statewide ACT retake day will be held this fall on a date chosen by Kentucky’s Department of Education. More information on the date and locations will be shared with schools in the coming months, Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Seventeen years after Hurricane Katrina flooded the city, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed an extensive system of floodgates, strengthened levees and added other protections. The 130-mile ring is designed to hold out a storm surge of about 30 feet around New Orleans and suburbs in three parishes. Congress provided $14.5 billion for what is formally called the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System and related projects. It included two features the Corps described as the world’s largest – a pumping station and a 1.8-mile barrier that can be closed against storm surges. The levees stood up to Hurricane Ida in 2021, though some suburbs outside the system flooded.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A settlement approved for the University of Maine at Augusta president who bowed out amid controversy ensures he will be paid at least $235,000 in the first year. Michael Laliberte will receive an additional $30,000 for a housing allowance on top of his $205,000 salary, which will be paid in a lump sum July 1, the Kennebec Journal reports. If he fails to obtain another job, then he will receive his full salary for another two years, or he will receive the balance if he receives a lower-paying job. University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy was taken to task for failing to disclose to a search committee that Laliberte was the subject of no-confidence votes in his previous job, at State University of New York at Delhi. Malloy has found himself on the receiving end of several no-confidence votes since the controversy began. Malloy, a former Democratic governor of Connecticut, has apologized for the handling of the job search, and Laliberte announced he was declining to take the job as scheduled Aug. 1. The settlement isn’t sitting well with some, especially after nine faculty members were cut the University of Maine at Farmington.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced vetoes of 18 bills Friday, including a measure that would have allowed voters who forget to sign their mail-in ballot envelope to do so after mailing it to get it counted. The Republican governor also vetoed a bill that would have allowed union dues to be tax-deductible, as well as a measure that would have stayed eviction proceedings against tenants who could show they are awaiting a determination about rental assistance. The Maryland General Assembly, which has a supermajority of Democrats, won’t have the chance to override these vetoes when lawmakers convene in January for their regular 90-day session because it is the last year of the term.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: It took more than three centuries, but Elizabeth Johnson Jr., the last Salem “witch” who wasn’t officially pardoned, has been cleared of her supposed crime. Massachusetts lawmakers on Thursday formally exonerated Johnson, clearing her name 329 years after she was convicted of witchcraft in 1693 and sentenced to death at the height of the Salem Witch Trials. Johnson was never executed, but neither was she officially pardoned like others wrongly accused of witchcraft. Lawmakers agreed to reconsider her case last year after a curious eighth grade civics class at North Andover Middle School took up her cause and researched the legislative steps needed to clear her name.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Two more Republican candidates for governor are suing to get on the Aug. 2 primary ballot, just days before the lineup must be settled. James Craig filed a lawsuit Friday night in the Court of Claims, while Michael Markey went to the Court of Appeals on Sunday. They were declared ineligible last week, the result of a tie vote by the Board of State Canvassers. State election officials said they didn’t meet the 15,000-signature threshold because of fraudulent signatures on petitions. Perry Johnson and Donna Brandenburg also didn’t make the ballot. Johnson filed a lawsuit Friday. There seems to be no dispute that fraudulent signatures were turned in by paid circulators, though there’s no evidence that the candidates were aware of the scam. The candidates want courts to order the board to put them on the ballot. They said the elections bureau should have inspected petitions line by line. In Johnson’s case, the appeals court said it could make a decision Tuesday. Five other Republican candidates landed a ballot spot, including Tudor Dixon, a former conservative TV news host who has the backing of Betsy DeVos, head of the U.S. Education Department during the Trump administration.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLafayette: The owner of a rural weekly newspaper in southern Minnesota is looking to give his publication away so he can travel to Ukraine. Minnesota Public Radio reports Lafayette-Nicollet Ledger owner and publisher Lee Zion is willing to dig trenches, teach school or fight in Ukraine. Before he leaves, he wants to give the newspaper away for free. Zion produces the newspaper by himself, reporting, editing and laying out pages for about 500 subscribers, and wants to make sure a person committed to local journalism takes over. He said the towns he covers would suffer if the newspaper disappeared.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Troublesome incidents involving female ride-share passengers and drivers have increased enough to prompt a local entrepreneur to come up with a new business, WLVT-TV reports. Literally Just Ladies is the first of its kind in the Magnolia State, Leigh Sullivan said, and she hopes it will offer safer transportation. She said an app for the company is being developed. Sullivan has been a ride-share driver in Jackson’s metro area for more than six years after doing the same work in her native New Orleans before coming to Mississippi. “And every single time I pick up a female at night, early morning, trying to get to the airport trying to get home from the airport, the first words I hear are, ‘I’m so glad it’s a woman. Thank God, it’s a woman,’ ” she said. Sullivan said she had tossed around the idea of an all-female wing of her transportation business for a while because of the feedback she was getting from her passengers. “And then Nov. 2, my friend Brandy got shot here in Jackson. She got shot seven times. And that was probably the defining moment, like, OK, now is the time.” Brandy Littrell, 36, a Lyft driver, was kidnapped Nov. 2, taken to a wooded area and shot seven times, miraculously surviving the attack.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A swastika was painted on the outside wall of a historically Black church in southwestern Missouri, and police are investigating the vandalism as a hate crime. Pitts Chapel United Methodist Church in Springfield reported the swastika was spray-painted on the building May 18 or 19. The NAACP and the Missouri chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the vandalism. A county parks crew removed the swastika. Pitts Chapel is Springfield’s oldest historically Black church, the Rev. Tracy Wolff said. It was founded in 1847 by a group of enslaved Africans.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal judge has given U.S. wildlife officials 18 months to decide if wolverines should be protected under the Endangered Species Act, following years of dispute over how much risk climate change and other threats pose to the rare and elusive predators. The order from U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy came after environmentalists challenged a 2020 decision under the Trump administration to withhold protections for the animals in the lower 48 states, where no more than 300 are thought to remain. Wildlife officials have previously estimated that 250 to 300 wolverines survive in remote areas of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington state. The animals in recent years also have been documented in California, Utah, Colorado and Oregon.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police arrested a 20-year-old man who had been going door-to-door with a chain saw after he caused a disturbance near a local school. Police said the man was about a quarter of a mile west of the Omaha Veterans Administration Center with the chain saw Friday morning in what they called an attempt to “make money.” Police said a homeowner confronted the man. They argued, and the man threatened the homeowner, who then chased the man. The man dropped his chain saw, but the homeowner tackled him another quarter of a mile to the west, near Holy Cross Catholic Church and its school. Police said the man tried to enter the school to get away from the homeowner, with no intent “to cause harm to anyone inside.” Police said they found several drug pipes on the man. He was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and possessing drug paraphernalia.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A high school honors student said in federal court that he’s being bullied by students and harassed by campus administrators who search him for a gun every time someone identifies him on a state hotline that invites anonymous reports of school threats. “I’m a student, not a threat,” Reno High School junior Lucas Gorelick, 16, told the Associated Press. “I have rights. I want people to know what is happening, and I want to ensure safety for all future students.” A lawsuit filed May 23 in U.S. District Court in Reno argued school district officials have violated Gorelick’s constitutional rights to equal protection and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. He said his backpack and pickup truck were searched five times in two weeks based on anonymous tips, but no weapon was found. He also noted he has been the target of other incidents he termed “bullying situations” that he traced to his Jewish heritage, his work with Democratic party candidates and his school achievements. His father, Jeff Gorelick, characterized a state Department of Education hotline called SafeVoice – established in 2017 after approval from the Legislature – as “an unthinking system” that grants anonymity to bullies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law a $100 million fund to settle sexual and physical abuse claims at a state-run youth detention center. The Legislature approved creating a fund to compensate those who were abused as children at the Sununu Youth Services Center, formerly the Youth Development Center. The Manchester center has been the target of a criminal investigation since 2019, and 11 former workers were arrested last year. Nearly 450 former residents have sued the state, with allegations involving more than 150 staffers from 1963 to 2018. Victims of sexual abuse would be eligible for payments of up to $1.5 million each, while payments to victims of physical abuse would be capped at $150,000. The center is named for former Gov. John H. Sununu, the current governor’s father.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Department of Environmental Protection will distribute $21.4million to counties and municipalities as part of the Clean Communities program to reduce litter and beautify the Garden State. The funding includes just under $19.1 million on the municipal level and $2.3 million awarded to the state’s 21 counties, said DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette. The money represents an increase of about $700,000 over the $20.7 million allocated for the 2021 fiscal year. The additional grant funds will help communities improve their local environments and improve quality of life by removing litter, including from roadways and around stormwater collection systems, LaTourette said. “These community-level efforts have far-reaching impacts across the state, from beautifying neighborhoods to improving water quality and enhancing wildlife habitats,” he said. Counties and municipalities can use the grants to promote litter-related activities such as cleanups and to purchase equipment for the activities. The money can also be used to adopt and enforce anti-littering ordinances and boost public information programs. “We are grateful for funding that helps keep New Jersey litter-free,” said JoAnn Gemenden, executive director of the New Jersey Clean Communities Council.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Students at Mora High School laughed and danced during their prom with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham at the Governor’s Mansion on Thursday night – a silver lining for students during a tumultuous end to the school year. Many students were forced to flee their homes by the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire in recent weeks, and some had only recently returned. Some students arrived decked out in suits and gowns, while others stuck to their roots, showing up in cowboy hats, jeans and boots. Spanish and country music boomed through speakers as students two-stepped across the governor’s back patio. Lujan Grisham said she couldn’t throw a party and sit on the sidelines, so she jumped in to dance the “Cupid Shuffle” with students, state Sen. Leo Jaramillo, D-Española, and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández. “I’m just elated that we could do this for the kids,” said New Mexico Education Secretary Kurt Steinhaus. “I’ve chaperoned a lot of proms – this one’s a little different than I’ve done before.” Lujan Grisham told the Albuquerque Journal a lot of work went into making sure students knew they had a “whole state that cares about their happiness and well-being.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Police say someone busted into the altar at a Brooklyn church, stole a $2 million gold relic and removed the head from a statue of an angel at some point late last week. The incident happened between 6:30 p.m. Thursday and 4 p.m. Saturday at St. Augustine’s Roman Catholic Church, known as the “Notre Dame” of Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood. The church was closed for construction at the time. Camera recordings from the church’s security system were also stolen, the church’s pastor said. The Diocese of Brooklyn called it “a brazen crime of disrespect and hate.” The diocese said the thief or thieves cut through a metal protective casing and made off with a tabernacle dating to the church’s opening in the 1890s. The tabernacle, a box containing Holy Communion items, was made of 18-carat gold and decorated with jewels, police and the diocese said. It’s valued at $2 million. The diocese said it is irreplaceable because of its historical and artistic value. According to a guidebook posted on the church’s website, the tabernacle was built in 1895 and restored in 1952 and 2000. It’s described as a “masterpiece and one of the most expensive tabernacles in the country, guarded by its own security system,” which involves an “electronically operated burglar-proof safe” and 1-inch-thick steel plates that “completely enclose the tabernacle.” Holy Eucharist, bread consecrated as the body of Christ, was taken from the tabernacle and thrown on the altar.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: New Hanover County School Board member Nelson Beaulieu might be out of a job in November. With all absentee and provisional ballots counted, Beaulieu fell behind newcomer Jennah Bosch for the final Democratic nomination for the school board race this fall. But it’s still unknown if that result will hold. Beaulieu is only behind Bosch by two votes, with not even 0.01% of the vote separating them. Beaulieu held a three-vote lead at the end of election night with all precincts reporting, but Bosch overcame that during the official canvass when absentee ballots were counted. With the canvass complete, the results are official, and as of now, Bosch will join Judy Justice, Dorian Cromartie and Veronica McLaurin-Brown as the Democratic candidates in the general election for school board in November. Beaulieu said he has not decided if he will demand a recount. Candidates are allowed to demand recounts if there is less than a 1% split between themselves and the lowest prevailing candidate. With such a slim margin between the candidates, a recount could change the result.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map showed 19% of the state in some form of drought, down from 21% two weeks ago and 80% three months ago, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Three-fourths of the state was suffering through either extreme or exceptional drought in May 2021. The western fourth of the state is still abnormally dry, but no severe, extreme or exceptional drought conditions exist anywhere in the state. Most of the state saw at least a half-inch of rain over the past week, which has helped improve conditions in western North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine announced plans Friday to spend “a significant amount of money” on efforts to ensure every school building in the state is properly protected against an attack. The Republican governor said he has asked the state schools superintendent for an assessment of which schools need such infrastructure additions within the next few days. DeWine did not name a figure but said: “This is not going to be cheap.” He also did not detail the types of security measures, which based on measures some schools already have in place might range from metal detectors to classroom barricade devices.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTaft: Authorities said a 26-year-old man was in custody after one person was killed and seven people were injured in a shooting early Sunday at an outdoor town festival in eastern Oklahoma, where witnesses described frantic people running for cover amid gunfire. An arrest warrant was issued for Skyler Buckner, and he turned himself in to the Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office on Sunday afternoon, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. OSBI said those shot at the Memorial Day event in Taft, located about 45 miles southeast of Tulsa, ranged in age from 9 to 56. A 39-year-old woman was killed, OSBI said. The injuries of those wounded were considered non-life-threatening. OSBI had earlier said two juveniles were injured in the shooting but said Sunday afternoon that only one juvenile was injured. Witnesses said an argument preceded the gunfire just after midnight, the agency said. About 1,500 people attended the event in Taft, which usually has a population of just a few hundred people. Members of the Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office were in attendance and immediately began rendering aid, OSBI said. Gov. Kevin Stitt said on Twitter that he was grateful for the OSBI’s “swift response to assist local police.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: It could be a dangerous boating and floating season on the North Santiam River. Downed trees have created one complete blockage in the river and two other major hazard points between Stayton and Jefferson. There haven’t been many incidents so far this season due to cool and wet weather, but with the river running higher than normal, warm weather approaching and potentially good fishing on the way, officials are warning boaters about the hazardous locations as the summer float season gets underway. “The amount of trees in the North Santiam has increased significantly this past year, and there are a fair number of obstructions,” said Brian Paulsen, boating safety program manager for the Oregon State Marine Board. “With high and cold water, there’s a high risk for everyone.” Many of the hazards come from numerous trees killed in the Labor Day fires that have been washed downstream and gotten trapped in certain areas of the river, particularly between Buell-Miller County Park boat ramp, Greens Bridge and Jefferson. The logs can capsize boats and sweep people into “strainers,” where strong current traps people against branches and limbs, sometimes leading to drowning. All reported obstructions statewide can be pinpointed on the Marine Board’s reported waterway obstruction dashboard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDent’s Run: A scientific analysis commissioned by the FBI shortly before agents went digging for buried treasure suggested that a huge quantity of gold could be below the surface, according to newly released government documents and photos that deepen the mystery of the 2018 excavation in remote western Pennsylvania. The report, by a geophysicist who performed microgravity testing at the site, hinted at an underground object with a mass of up to 9 tons and a density consistent with gold. The FBI used the consultant’s work to obtain a warrant to seize the gold – if there was any to be found. The government has long claimed its dig was a bust. But a father-son pair of treasure hunters who spent years hunting for the fabled Civil War-era gold – and who led agents to the woodland site, hoping for a finder’s fee – suspect the FBI double-crossed them and made off with a cache that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The newly revealed geophysical survey was part of a court-ordered release of government records on the FBI’s treasure hunt at Dent’s Run, about 135 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, where legend says an 1863 shipment of Union gold was either lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Brown University graduates Sunday to “hold on to your hope,” even when faced with darkness in the world right now. “Amid the darkness, it would be easy to descend into apathy or despair. But we can’t. We can’t,” Pelosi said at the Ivy League school in Providence. The California Democrat referenced the “senseless” shootings at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a supermarket in Buffalo, New York – as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights, the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and voter suppression. “You’re graduating into a vastly different world,” she said, congratulating the students on their bravery and resilience. Referencing President Abraham Lincoln’s efforts to unite the country during “one of America’s darkest hours,” Pelosi called on the graduates “to help summon the better angels of our nature to help heal America’s fractured soul.” Pelosi was the principal speaker for the Class of 2022 commencement ceremony and one of nine people to receive an honorary degree during the three-day commencement weekend. Recording artist Shaggy was also honored Saturday for his work as a musician and a philanthropist.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Scientists are looking for volunteers to help them study the differences in heat across short distances in the city. A sensor will be put on the car window of volunteers who will then drive certain routes to get exact temperature readings, University of South Carolina professor Kirstin Dow told WLTX-TV. Dow is part of a mapping project paid for by the National Integrated Heat Health Information System to identify and research heat islands, or small areas that are hotter than their surroundings just feet away. That data can help determine the best materials to use for buildings or ground cover or how important trees are to cooling off as temperatures are expected to get hotter. A similar mapping project was done in Charleston last summer and determined the influence of the sea breeze doesn’t extend far inland, said Scott Curtis, the director of the Near Center for Climate Studies, which helped Charleston with the study. “One of the areas that was the hottest was the port. And not because it was near the water – because there is lots of asphalt, lots of concrete, there’s just no vegetation at all,” Curtis said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 60 Indigenous students celebrated their high school graduation in a special ceremony Friday. The Sioux Falls School District has held a senior honoring ceremony specifically for Indigenous students for at least a decade, said Anna Brokenleg, instructional coach and teacher on special assignment for the Office of Indian Education for the district. A total of 90 Native American students will graduate from Sioux Falls public schools this year, Brokenleg said, counting 60 who were able to attend Friday night’s ceremony, ahead of graduation for all four public high schools Sunday. “Historically, when you look at graduation rates for Native students, they’re often very low,” Brokenleg said, explaining why it’s important to honor these students in a culturally relevant manner. “Hearing from a variety of elders and professionals allows them to see a mirror of the kinds of things they can be in life … and to have a gathering for families to be able to celebrate with them, and the hard work they’ve put in … it’s a really important thing to do.” The honoring ceremony started with an opening prayer, songs by Crazy Bull, and a presentation of the U.S. and South Dakota flags, as well as an eagle feather staff, by veterans. Three speakers gave addresses, then a group of student leaders carried in their tribal flags.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has signed off on a new campaign finance and ethics face-lift, bucking objections from some of the state’s most influential advocacy groups who opposed the measure. “I think that transparency is a good idea,” Lee told reporters earlier this month. “I think that whenever we have transparency into organizations that politically lobby, that’s a good thing.” The Republican governor signed the measure Friday. The move comes as a federal investigation has hovered over the GOP-controlled General Assembly for over a year that has so far led to one Republican lawmaker pleading guilty to a federal wire fraud charge over allegations she helped carry out a political consulting kickback scheme. However, even as the statehouse’s top legislative leaders called for campaign ethics reform amid the ongoing investigation scandals, so-called dark money groups have remained fiercely opposed to the new changes. Many argued the law will result in them disclosing donors. Opponents include Americans for Prosperity, Tennessee Right to Life and the National Rifle Association. Supporters counter that the new law will shine a light on expenditures, not donors. Specifically, certain politically active nonprofits must disclose spending totaling at least $5,000 within 60 days of an election on communications that contain a state candidate’s name or likeness. The measure also states that political committee leadership must provide identification.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A man has been sentenced to six years in prison for setting fire to the Travis County Democratic Party office in downtown Austin. Federal court records showed Ryan Faircloth, 31, of San Antonio, was sentenced Friday to 72 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to arson for throwing a Molotov cocktail into the office in September. An attorney for Faircloth did not immediately return a phone call for comment Saturday. Faircloth, who was arrested days after the attack, had faced up to 20 years in prison before reaching a plea agreement in the case. No one was in the office when it was attacked about 2 a.m. Only a small stack of papers caught fire, officials have said, and the blaze was quickly extinguished by employees of a neighboring business.\n\nUtah\n\nSyracuse: Ninth graders at Syracuse Arts Academy asked a science teacher whose gender transition they witnessed to be their graduation speaker. Bree Borrowman began transitioning two years ago, when the students were seventh graders, and they supported her at every step in her journey, she said. So she was especially touched when student body officers asked her to be the one to send them off on their own new journey. As as far as she can tell, she may be the first transgender person ever to speak at a graduation event in Utah, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Each one of you is absolutely brilliant, beautiful and wonderful,” Borrowman told the group of 132 ninth graders at the public charter school. “However, feelings of shame and guilt from outside influences can often make us feel less than and unloved. … You are not alone. I love you. And my door is always open.” Parents, administrators and former students waited in a group around Borrowman after the ceremony to thank her for her speech. Some said it made them think of how they can be more supportive of their family members and friends who are LGBTQ. Borrowman, 65, grew up in Bountiful and has lived in Utah nearly all of her life.\n\nVermont\n\nWeybridge: The remains of a Revolutionary War soldier are being moved to a resting place elsewhere in the state because erosion threatens some of the graves at an old cemetery near a riverbank. Josiah Clark, who fought in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill in Massachusetts, was buried in the Stow cemetery in Weybridge in 1835. Erosion over the years left his grave perched on the edge of a steep eroding bank, so his bones were exhumed in 2019. This month a horse-drawn wagon carried a flag-draped coffin containing Clark from the congregational church to another cemetery nearby for a reinterment ceremony. The rest of the roughly 20 graves will also be moved to the Old Weybridge Hill Cemetery eventually, including the remains of Revolutionary War soldier William Haven.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Legislative leaders are proposing a new criminal misdemeanor in state law for possession of more than 4 ounces of marijuana in public. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the proposal is included in a new two-year state budget plan, which became publicly available online Sunday evening. The General Assembly will meet Wednesday in special session to consider the budget. The language on marijuana – like much of the budget agreement – followed discussions that were not held in public. The budget compromise backed by House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight, a Republican, and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Janet Howell, a Democrat, would write into law that anyone caught in public with more than 4 ounces of marijuana would be guilty of a Class 3 criminal misdemeanor that carries a fine of up to $500, plus a criminal record. A second or subsequent offense would be a Class 2 misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. Chelsea Higgs Wise, executive director of the group Marijuana Justice Virginia, along with heads of other organizations, blasted the proposal in an email sent to Howell on Sunday evening. “Please stop finding more ways to criminalize Virginians,” she wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s appointments to an obscure regulatory panel have cost the state $70,000 in a public records lawsuit settlement and forced the governor to name new appointees. The dispute centered on Inslee’s handling of appointments to the Washington State Building Code Council, which establishes minimum standards for new construction, including rules for energy efficiency, plumbing and fire safety, The Seattle Times reports. State law says two of the council’s 15 members must be nominated by trade associations representing residential and commercial builders. But Inslee last year ignored builder group recommendations and instead named two of his own picks. The Building Industry Association of Washington and the Associated General Contractors of Washington sued over the appointments and filed another lawsuit saying the governor’s office failed to turn over relevant documents after a public records request. The state later admitted that a member of Inslee’s staff had made a material false statement in a sworn court declaration by saying one of Inslee’s nominees had been put forward by another building trade group, when he had not.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: After more than a half-century of carrying visitors on scenic round-trip journeys to the depths of two river gorges, the aerial tramways serving Hawks Nest and Pipestem Resort state parks soon will be replaced. West Virginia State Parks officials are hopeful new, improved aerial tramways will be operating at the two parks next year. The Hawks Nest aerial tramway has been closed since June 6, when a routine morning inspection by the state park’s staff turned up a safety issue that required substantial remediation. “Since then, we’ve shuttled 7,600 people down to the marina to ride the jet boat,” said Joe Baughman, the park’s superintendent. The shuttle involves a van trip from Hawks Nest’s lodge to Ansted, about a mile to the east, followed by a 4-mile descent to Hawks Nest Lake on Mill Creek Road. The Hawks Nest tramway, which opened in 1970, typically carries more than 45,000 visitors annually on steep, 800-foot descents from the lodge to a marina on Hawks Nest Lake at the base of the New River Gorge. The aerial tramway at Pipestem, which began operating in 1972, carries visitors nearly two-thirds of a mile, descending from the rim of Bluestone Canyon and crossing the Bluestone River before arriving at Mountain Creek Lodge. The trip involves an 1,100-foot drop in elevation and six minutes of sightseeing time.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: When Wisconsin Republicans asked the public to report concerns about the 2020 election, voters flocked to the web to submit tips – often about the very officials conducting the probe. “There is a very disturbed man ranting like a lunatic and telling provable lies about the election in order to undermine election integrity,” one person wrote in April. “Not only that, he’s stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from taxpayers by pretending to do a legitimate investigation. This is fraud at the highest levels and he literally advocated nullifying the votes of Wisconsin. Please stop this flagrant fraud asap.” The submission was similar to dozens of others filed over the past year that taunt Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester and former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman for budgeting $676,000 for a review of a presidential election that recounts, court decisions and independent studies have concluded was properly called for President Joe Biden. Few submissions contained concrete tips about the way the election was run. Some were vague. Others were unhinged. The messages were submitted over the past year to a wifraud.com, a website set up by Gableman. He recently shut down the site but continues to maintain two others, wielectionreview.org and wispecialcounsel.org.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Organizers of a planned abortion clinic say they won’t be deterred by last week’s potential arson. When they settled on a summer opening for the women’s health clinic earlier this year, they felt upbeat about their plans even as they knew they would face opposition to what will be the only such clinic to offer abortions in the state. There were the expected protests and harassing messages. Things got more tense after a leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that, if finalized, would likely make abortions illegal in Wyoming and half of the states. Then last week, their building was damaged by a fire police believe was deliberately set. None of it has derailed plans to open the clinic – a rarity in heavily Republican parts of the United States where most abortion providers at the moment are fighting just to stay in business, let alone expand services. “We can’t be bullied into submission,” Julie Burkhart, the clinic founder, said as she watched from across the street as Casper police and firefighters investigated the blaze.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}]}

Prisoner swap\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner is back in the US after she was released from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. “Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones – and she should have been there all along,” President Joe Biden said Thursday upon securing her release. Despite Biden’s various attempts, the swap did not include another American that the US State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. “The choice was bringing Brittney Griner home right now, or bringing no one home right now,” a senior administration official said. In a phone interview with CNN, Whelan said he was happy Griner was released but expressed disappointment in his continued detention.\n\n2. Face masks\n\nMany Americans were relieved when Covid-19 mandates were lifted and wearing masks became optional in public spaces instead of required. Now, some of the nation’s leading health experts are encouraging people to put their face masks back on as a triple threat of respiratory illnesses – flu, RSV and Covid-19 – sweeps the nation. Several communities across the country are already considering bringing back certain masking recommendations as the wave of respiratory illnesses worsens. For example, Los Angeles is staying below the “high” level of staffed Covid patient beds, at 6.9%, but health officials say they will consider masks again if that level goes above 10%. In New York, meanwhile, flu cases have nearly tripled in three weeks, prompting officials to encourage indoor public masking.\n\n3. January 6\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol is considering criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump and at least four of his close allies, multiple sources told CNN. The committee has not yet officially decided whom to refer to the Justice Department for prosecution and for what offenses, but the four individuals who are among those under consideration are former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, right wing lawyer John Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the sources said. The criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature and would mainly serve as a way to document the committee’s views for the record. The committee is aiming to release its final report and vote on criminal referrals on December 21.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analyst breaks down how much weight Jan. 6 criminal referrals hold 01:27 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Winter storms\n\nMillions of people across the US are under winter weather advisories as a storm system brings the threat of tornadoes, blizzard conditions and flooding early next week. According to the latest regional forecasts, wintry conditions will push into the upper Midwest today, then a cold front will begin to impact the Pacific Northwest and bring up to two inches of rainfall along the coast. Over a foot of snow is expected across the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The storm will begin to impact the Pacific Northwest this evening, bringing additional threats this weekend. Meteorologists say new concerns will likely emerge early next week as the storm progresses eastward into the central US.\n\n5. Twitter\n\nThousands of suspended Twitter users, including members of the far-right and users sharing blatant misinformation, have begun to have their accounts restored to the platform, an independent analysis shows. The mass restoration of banned accounts comes after new owner Elon Musk said that he would offer “general amnesty” to many who had been removed. A number of users on Twitter have raised questions about Musk’s move last week to again suspend Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, while restoring the accounts of other white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. In another instance, Musk tweeted that he would not restore Alex Jones’ account because of a personal preference. Separately, several former employees suing Twitter are speaking out on Musk’s recent layoffs, alleging the company violated multiple labor rights laws.\n\nTHIS JUST IN\n\nSinema leaving the Democratic Party and registering as an independent\n\nArizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is leaving the Democratic Party and registering as a political independent, she told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an exclusive TV interview. “I’ve registered as an Arizona independent. I know some people might be a little bit surprised by this, but actually, I think it makes a lot of sense,” Sinema said in a Thursday interview with Tapper in her Senate office. “I’ve never fit neatly into any party box. I’ve never really tried. I don’t want to,” she added. Sinema’s move away from the Democratic Party is unlikely to change the power balance in the next Senate.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nScott Jennings: DeSantis shows he can do what Trump can’t\n\nScott Jennings courtesy of Scott Jennings\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent a clear message to every Republican voter Tuesday night: My way is the path to a national majority, and former President Donald Trump’s way is the path to future disappointments and continued suffering.\n\nFour years ago, DeSantis won his first gubernatorial race by less than a percentage point. His nearly 20-point win against Democratic candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday sent the message that DeSantis, not Trump, can win over the independent voters who decide elections.\n\nDeSantis’ decisive victory offers a future where the Republican Party might actually win the popular vote in a presidential contest – something that hasn’t been done since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the candidates Trump endorsed in 2022 struggled, and it was clear from CNN exit polls that the former President – with his 37% favorability rating – would be a serious underdog in the 2024 general election should he win the Republican presidential nomination for a third time.\n\nMy friend Patrick Ruffini of Echelon Insights tweeted a key observation: DeSantis commanded huge support among Latinos in 2022 compared to Trump in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won the heavily Latino Miami-Dade County by seven points. DeSantis flipped the county on Tuesday and ran away with an 11-point win.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Osceola County by nearly 14 points. This time, DeSantis secured the county by nearly seven points, marking a whopping 21-point swing.\n\nDeSantis combined his strength among Latinos with his support among working class Whites, suburban white-collar voters and rural Floridians. That’s a coalition that could win nationally, unlike Trump’s limited appeal among several traditional Republican voting segments.\n\nLast year, it was Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia who scored an earthquake in a Biden state by keeping Trump at arm’s length and focusing on the issues. Tonight, it was DeSantis who ran as his own man (Trump rallied for Marco Rubio but not DeSantis at the end of the campaign) and showed what you can do when you combine the political instincts required to be a successful Republican these days with actual governing competence.\n\nDeSantis made a convincing case that he, rather than Trump, gives Republicans the best chance to defeat Biden (or some other Democrat) in 2024. With Trump plotting a reelection campaign announcement soon, DeSantis has a lot to think about and a solid springboard from which to launch a challenge to the former President.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W.

If election night confirmed anything for me it is this: We can all – voters, doomscrollers, pundits and election deniers included – stop believing every election revolves around former President Donald Trump. Instead, when asked in exit polls across the country, younger people, women and other voters in key demographics said their top concerns were inflation, abortion rights, crime and other quality of life issues.\n\nWhat a relief. It finally feels like a majority of voters want to re-center American politics away from the toxic, conspiracy theory-driven rhetoric we’ve experienced over the past several years.\n\nYes, Republicans are still projected to take control of the House of Representatives, with a narrow (and narrowing) majority – but will that make much difference? Despite the advantage Democrats had in the chamber the past two years, President Joe Biden has still had to battle and compromise to get parts of his agenda passed. How the balance of power will settle in the Senate is unclear, with a few races in key states still undecided as of this afternoon. It will likely hinge, again, on Georgia, and a forthcoming runoff election between the incumbent, Democrat Raphael Warnock, and his GOP challenger, former football star Herschel Walker.\n\nNo matter what party you claim, there were positive signs coming out of the midterms. My hometown, Philadelphia, and its surrounding suburbs, came up big in another election – rejecting the Trump-backed New Jersey transplant, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and helping to send Democratic candidate John Fetterman to the US Senate. Pennsylvania voters also rejected an election denier, Doug Mastriano, in the race for state governor, and made history by electing Democrat Summer Lee as the state’s first Black woman to serve in Congress.\n\nMaryland voters, meanwhile, elected Democrat Wes Moore as their state’s first Black governor. And in New England, Maura Healey became Massachusetts’ first female governor. She’s also the first out lesbian to win a state governorship anywhere in the US.\n\nDemocracy, freedom and equality also won out on ballot issues.\n\nIn unfinished business, voters tackled slavery, permanently abolishing “involuntary servitude” in four states – Vermont, Oregon, Alabama and Tennessee. (Louisiana held on to the slavery clause under its constitution, however.)\n\nDespite efforts to limit voting rights across the nation, voters in Alabama approved a measure requiring that any change to state election law goes into effect at least six months before a general election. And, in Kentucky, voters narrowly beat back an amendment that would have removed constitutional protections for abortion rights – one of several instances in which voters refused to accept restrictive reproductive rights measures.\n\nStill, the highlight of my midterms night was watching 25-year-old Maxwell Frost win a US congressional race in Florida – holding a Democratic seat in a state whose 2022 results skewed red, no less. More and more, we are seeing young people energized, voting and stepping up with fresh ideas to lead this democracy.

Jones is co-author of “Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.” She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia’s 900AM WURD.\n\nMichael D’Antonio: Money, golf and fame are Trump’s best options\n\nMichael D'Antonio Toni Raiten-D'Antonio.\n\nVoters made Tuesday a bad night for former President Donald Trump. Despite his efforts, many of his favorites not only lost but denied the GOP the usual out-party wave of wins that come in midterm elections. This leaves a diminished Trump with the challenge of deciding what to do next.\n\nIn the short term, the man who so often returns to his well-worn playbook resumed his years-long effort to ruin Americans’ confidence in any election his team loses. “Protest, protest, protest,” he told his followers, even before all the polls closed. In a sign of his declining power, no mass protests ensued.\n\nNevertheless, false claims of election fraud will likely be a major theme if he follows through on his loudly voiced hints that he plans to run for the White House again in 2024.\n\nTo run or not to run is now the main question. It’s not an easy choice. Trump could end up like other one-term presidents he has mocked, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, who retreated from politics and devoted themselves to new interests. However, he has other options. He could revive his television career – Fox News? – or return to his businesses. Or, he could develop a new role as leader of an organization that can exploit his prodigious fundraising ability, and give him a platform for grabbing attention, while leaving him plenty of time for golf.\n\nRunning could forestall the various legal problems he faces, but he has lawyers who might accomplish the same goal. Fox News is unlikely to pay enough, and his businesses are now being watched by a court-appointed overseer. This leaves him with a combination of easy work – fundraising and pontificating – combined with his favorite pastimes: fame, money and fun. What’s not to like?\n\nMichael D’Antonio is the author of the book “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success” and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book “High Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.”\n\nDavid Gergen: A sigh of relief for Americans\n\nDavid Gergen\n\nFor many Americans deeply worried about the future of our democracy, Tuesday’s elections brought a glimmer of hope. Instead of chaos, we had an orderly process of voting. So far, the streets have been free of violence, the courts are not clogged with petitions to overthrow the results and many election deniers have been cast aside. Overall, this was an election that rejected the extremists and rallied the friends of democracy. Whatever your political leanings, that is very good news.\n\nIt was especially encouraging to see voters of younger generations turn out in droves. John Della Volpe, the pollster for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, told me that this was the third straight national election – 2018, 2020 and now 2022 – in which the youth vote has surged. And their votes mattered: Drawing upon exit polls, Volpe estimates that voters over 40 were likely to vote for Republican candidates while voters under 40 went for Democrats – and those under 40 were the determining factor.\n\nIt was also inspiring that a number of newcomers to the political arena did so well in pledging to work with others across the aisle. There is no better example than Wes Moore, who was elected the first Black governor of Maryland. Moore had never run for office before, but he had a compelling background – a combat veteran of the 82nd Airborne, a powerful leader in the nonprofit world and far more – and he spoke with a humility that appealed.\n\nThis was also an election, of course, that will go down in history as a huge surprise. Give credit where it is due – President Joe Biden pulled it off even though his approval ratings were fairly abysmal. Now the question is whether he can translate his success (and that of other Democrats) into greater progress in governing. Knowing how recalcitrant his opponents can be, he was smart to reach out to Republican leaders within hours.\n\nBottom line: Tough days still lie ahead, but for one of the first times in recent memory, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief that there are still people in the public arena hungry to bring us together again.\n\nDavid Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents of both parties and is a senior political analyst at CNN.

Gov. Hochul now has to deliver\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy of Jill Filipovic\n\nDemocrat Kathy Hochul won the New York State gubernatorial race, and thank goodness. Her opponent, Lee Zeldin, is not your typical moderate Republican who usually stands a chance in a blue state. Instead, he’s an abortion opponent who wanted voters to simply trust he wouldn’t mess with New York’s abortion laws.\n\nZeldin was endorsed by the National Rifle Association when he was in Congress. He is a Trump acolyte who voted against certifying the 2020 election in Congress, after texting with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and reportedly planning to contest the outcome of the 2020 election before the results were even in.\n\nNew Yorkers sent a definitive message: Our values matter, even in moments of profound uncertainty.\n\nPlus, Hochul made history as the first woman elected to the governor’s office in New York.\n\nThis race was, in its final days, predicted to be closer than it actually was. Part of that was simply the usual electoral math: The minority party typically has an advantage in the midterms, and Republicans are a minority in Washington, DC, with a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress. And polling in New York state didn’t look as good for Hochul as it should have in a solidly blue state: Voters who talked to pollsters emphasized crime fears and the economy; abortion rights were galvanizing, but didn’t seem as definitive in an election for a governor vastly unlikely to have an abortion criminalization bill delivered to her desk.\n\nThe polls were imperfect. It turns out that New Yorkers are, in fact, New Yorkers: Not cowed by overblown claims of crime (while I think crime is indeed a problem Democrats should address, New York City remains one of the safest places in the country); determined to defend the racial, ethnic and sexual diversity that makes our state great; and committed to standing up against the tyranny of an anti-democratic party that would force women into pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nHowever, Democrats shouldn’t take this win for granted. The issues voters raised – inflation, crime – are real concerns. And the reasons many voters turned out – abortion rights, democratic norms – remain under threat.\n\nHochul’s job now is to address voter concerns, while standing up for New York values: Openness, decency, freedom for all. Because that’s what New Yorkers did today: The majority of us didn’t cast our ballots from a place of fear and reaction, but from the last dregs of hope and optimism. We voted for what we want. And we now want our governor to deliver.\n\nJill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.\n\nDouglas Heye: In North Carolina, the issue of crime loomed large\n\nDouglas Heye Jeremy Freeman\n\nNorth Carolina’s Senate race received less attention than contests in some other states – possibly a result of the campaign having lesser-known candidates than states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nIn the waning weeks of the race, multiple polls had the candidates – Democratic former state Supreme Court chief justice Cheri Beasley and Republican US House Rep. Ted Budd – separated by a percentage point or less.\n\nPerhaps more than in any other Senate campaign, the issue of crime loomed large in North Carolina, with Budd claiming in his speeches that it had become much more dangerous to walk the streets in the state. That talking point, along with his focus on inflation, appeared to help propel him to victory in Tuesday’s vote.\n\nBeasley, by contrast, focused much of her attention on abortion, making it a central plank of her campaign that she would stand up not just for women’s reproductive rights, but workplace protections and equal pay.\n\nThe two candidates were vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Despite being seen as a red state – albeit that is less solidly Republican than neighboring southern states – North Carolina has elected Democrats as five of the last six governors and two of the last six senators.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama won the state in 2008 but lost it in 2012 by one of the closest margins in the nation. And while Donald Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020, he never received 50% of the vote.\n\nDouglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator.

Nelson\n\nMany of us suspected that Democratic Florida Congresswoman and former House impeachment manager Val Demings would have an uphill battle unseating incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, and weren’t entirely surprised when she lost the race. With 98% of the vote counted, Rubio won easily, garnering 57.8% of the vote to Demings’ 41.1%.\n\nAs it turns out, Tuesday was a tough night all around for Black women running statewide. Beyond Demings’ loss, Judge Cheri Beasley narrowly lost her Senate bid in North Carolina.\n\nAnd in the big heartbreak of the night, Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor’s race to Gov. Brian Kemp – a repeat of her defeat to him four years ago, when the two tangled for what at the time was an open seat.\n\nAbrams shook up the 2018 race by expanding the electoral map, enlisting more women and people of color who turned out in record numbers – but she fell short of punching her ticket to Georgia’s governor’s mansion. And on Tuesday she lost to Kemp by a much wider margin than in 2018.\n\nHad Abrams succeeded, she would have been the first Black woman to become the governor of a US state. After her second straight electoral loss, America is still waiting for that breakthrough.\n\nMeanwhile, an ever bigger winner of the night was Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis, who handily defeated Democrat Charlie Crist.\n\nDeSantis’ big night solidifies what some feel is a compelling claim to front-runner status for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, on what turned out to be a strong election night for Republicans in the state.\n\nIt’s hard for a Democrat to win statewide in the deep South. And as Demings, Beasley and Abrams have shown, it’s particularly tough for a Black woman to win statewide in the region: In fact, it’s never been done.\n\nAll three women were well-qualified and well-funded stars in their party. But, when we look at the final vote tallies, it tells a familiar story. Take Demings, for example, a former law enforcement officer – she was Orlando’s police chief – and yet, she did not get the big law enforcement endorsements. Rubio did, although he never wore the blue.\n\nThat was a big red flag for me, and it showed how much gender and race still play in the minds of male voters and power brokers of my generation and older. For Black women, a double burden of both race and gender at play. It is the nagging story of our lives.\n\nAs for Abrams, I think Kemp was helped by backing away from Trump and modulating his campaign message to appeal to suburban women and independents.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, just didn’t have the same support and enthusiasm this time around for her candidacy. And that is unfortunate, but for her to lose by such a big margin says much more.\n\nAt the end of the day however, these three women have nothing to regret. They ran great campaigns, and they created great future platforms for themselves. And they each put one more crack in the glass ceiling facing candidates for the US Senate and governors’ mansions.\n\nSophia A.

Still, as a longtime Pennsylvania election-watcher, I see three clear takeaways:\n\n1) Pennsylvanians don’t take to extreme anti-establishment candidates. The GOP candidate for governor, Doug Mastriano, broke the mold of just about any statewide candidate in the last few decades.\n\nThe state that delivered wins to center-right and center-left candidates like my father Gov, Dick Thornburgh, Sen. Bob Casey and Gov, Tom Ridge gave establishment Democrat Josh Shapiro a wipeout double-digit victory.\n\n2) “You’re not from here and I am” and “Stick it to the man” proved to be sufficiently powerful messages for alt-Democrat John Fetterman to win his Senate race, albeit by a much smaller margin.\n\nAmplified by more than $300 million in campaign spending (making PA’s the most expensive Senate race in the country), those two simple themes spoke to the quirky, stubborn authenticity that is a longstanding strand of Pennsylvania’s political DNA.\n\n3) In the home of Independence Hall, independent voters made a significant difference. Pretty much every poll since the beginning of both marquee races showed the two party candidates with locked in lopsided mirror-image margins among members of their own party.\n\nOver 90% of Democrats said they’d vote for Shapiro or Fetterman and close to 90% of Republicans said the same of Mastriano or Oz. The 20 to 30% of PA voters who consider themselves independent voters may have been more decisive than most tea-leaves readers gave them credit for.\n\nMost polls showed Shapiro and Fetterman with whopping leads among independent voters. They may not have been the same independent voters: Shapiro’s indy supporters could be former GOP voters disaffected by Trump, and Fetterman’s indy squad could be young voters mobilized by the abortion rights issue (about half of young voters are independents nationally).\n\nThe growing significance of this independent vote in close elections may increase pressure on both parties to repeal closed primaries so that indy voters can vote in those elections. Both parties will want to have more time and opportunity to court them in the future.\n\nWith Florida ripening to a deeper and deeper Red, Pennsylvania may loom larger and larger as the most contested, consequential swing state in the country: well-worth watching as we move inexorably to 2024.\n\nDavid Thornburgh is a longtime Pennsylvania civic leader.

There was a palpable sense of excitement and urgency around the election on campus. For many young people, especially young women, there was one motivating issue that drove their participation: abortion rights.\n\nOne of the most important and contentious issues on the ballot in Michigan was Proposal 3 (commonly known as Prop 3), which codifies the right to abortion and other reproductive freedoms, such as birth control, into the Michigan state constitution. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many Michiganders have feared the return of a 1931 law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, and contains felony criminal penalties for abortion providers.\n\nThough the courts have prevented that old law from taking effect, voters were eager to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution, and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Prop 3 with over 55% of voters approving the proposal. This is a major feat given the coordinated campaign against the proposal. Both pro-life groups and the Catholic Church strongly opposed it, and many ads claimed it was “too confusing and too extreme.”\n\nThe issue of abortion was a major focal point of the gubernatorial campaign between Gov, Gretchen Whitmer and her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon. Pro-Whitmer groups consistently highlighted Dixon’s support of a near-total abortion ban and her past comments that having a rapist’s baby could help a victim heal. Whitmer’s resounding win in the purple state of Michigan is certainly due, in part, to backlash against Dixon’s extreme positions on the issue.\n\nAfter the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, so many young voters felt helpless and despondent about the future of abortion rights. However, instead of throwing in the towel, Michigan voters showed up and displayed their support for Whitmer and Prop 3, showing that Michiganders support bodily autonomy and the right to choose.\n\nIsabelle Schindler is a senior at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy.

Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, whose campaign received $3.75 million from Nike founder Phil Knight, conceded early Tuesday night, having garnered 9% of the vote – a clear rejection of the idea that big donors can buy elections.\n\nAs Kotek takes the baton from Democrat Kate Brown, the least-popular governor in the country, she’ll confront a rising tide of homelessness in Portland. Along with drug use and violent crime, homelessness tops concerns of the city’s voters, and Kotek brings to Salem a legislative track-record of tackling the issue head on.\n\nKotek’s victory indicates that Oregonians remain concerned about issues Democrats focus on, with voters this cycle passing one of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. The electorate also overwhelmingly approved a measure amending the state constitution to penalize lawmakers who walk out of legislative sessions in order to stymie bill passage, a strategy the Republican caucus deployed in 2019 and 2020 in opposition to vaccine, gun regulation and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade bills.\n\nAnd, in the wake of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights loomed large in this gubernatorial election, with Kotek vowing to enshrine legal protections for Oregon abortion providers and to establish a fund to increase access to reproductive health care. Against a sea of Republican-led anti-LGBTQ initiatives across the country, Kotek also makes history as one of the first two openly-lesbian governors (Maura Healey, who won the governor’s race in Massachusetts, is the other).\n\nWhen she entered the race, Drazan declared this would be “a Republican year” in Oregon and across the nation. The “red wave” Republicans hoped for failed to materialize, but they came shockingly close to taking the governorship in a Democratic stronghold. Voters have signaled that while they’re staying blue for now, the state has serious problems – and they expect Democrats to step up and get results.\n\nLindsey Mantoan, an Oregon resident, is an associate professor of theater and resident dramaturg at Linfield University.

In the end, it wasn’t – with author and political newcomer J.D. Vance defeating Rep. Tim Ryan by over six percentage points.\n\nRepublicans also swept every statewide office in Ohio, including the elections for justices on the Ohio Supreme Court who, for the first time, had their political party listed next to their names on the ballot. This will give the Republicans a dependable majority on state’s highest court, which is significant since there is an ongoing unresolved legal battle over the drawing of state and federal legislative districts.\n\nIt is now safe to say that Ohio, for so long the quintessential swing state, is a Republican state. What happened is simple to explain: White, working-class voters have become a solid part of the Republican coalition in the Buckeye State. In 2016, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump convinced these voters that the Democratic Party had abandoned them to progressive and internationalist interests with values they did not share. This shift was symbolized by the movement of voters in the former manufacturing hub of Northeast Ohio, once the most Democratic part of the state, to the GOP.\n\nThe question going into 2022 was whether the Republicans could keep these voters if Trump was not on the ballot. The Democrats recruited Rep. Tim Ryan to run for the Senate because he was from Northeast Ohio, having grown up just north of Youngstown. They hoped that he could win those working-class voters back, and Ryan designed his campaign around working-class economic interests, distancing himself from Washington, DC, Democrats and even opposing President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program. Once the votes were counted, however, Ryan performed only slightly better than Biden had in Northeast Ohio. In fact, he even lost Trumbull County, the place where he grew up and whose voters he represented in Washington for two decades.\n\nOhio Democrats will face another test in two years, when the Democratic Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown will be on the ballot. Brown won in 2018, but given last night’s result, the Republicans will have no problem recruiting a quality candidate to run for a seat that, right now, at least leans Republican.\n\nPaul Sracic is a professor of politics and international relations at Youngstown State University and the coauthor of “Ohio Politics and Government” (Congressional Quarterly Press, 2015).

Davis Courtesy Dan Gleiter\n\nPennsylvanians clearly rejected the worst of right-wing extremism on Nov. 8, sending a strong message to former President Donald Trump that his endorsement doesn’t guarantee victory in the Keystone State.\n\nTrump proved to be a two-time loser in the commonwealth this election cycle, despite stirring up his base with screaming rallies for Republican candidates Dr. Mehmet Oz, Doug Mastriano and Rep. Scott Perry.\n\nAnd a lot of people are breathing a long, hard sign of relief.\n\nMastriano, who CNN projects will lose the race for the state’s governor to Democrat Josh Shapiro, scared many Pennsylvanians with his brash, take-no-prisoners Trump swagger. He inflamed racial tensions, embraced Christian nationalism, and once said women who violated his proposed abortion ban should be charged with murder. On top of all that, he’s an unapologetic election denier.\n\nDr. Oz, meanwhile, couldn’t shake his carpetbagger baggage, and Oprah’s rejection – on November 4, she endorsed his rival and now-victorious candidate in the Senate race, John Fetterman – seems to have carried more weight than Trump’s rallies, at least in the feedback I’ve received from readers and community members.\n\nAll of this should compel some serious soul-searching among Republican leadership in Pennsylvania. What could have they been thinking to place all their marbles on someone so outside of the mainstream as Mastriano? Did they think Pennsylvanians wouldn’t check Oz’s address? Will they rethink their hardline stance on abortion?\n\nIn a widely-watched House race, Harrisburg City Councilwoman Shamaine Daniels made a valiant Democratic effort to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Perry, after the party’s preferred candidate pulled out of the race. But her lack of name recognition and inexperience on the state or national stage impacted her ability to establish a base of her own. So the five-term incumbent, who played a role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, will return to Washington – though perhaps with a clipped wing.\n\nMany Pennsylvanians may be staunch conservatives, but we proved we’re not extremists – and we won’t embrace Trump or his candidates if they threaten the very foundations of democracy.\n\nJoyce M.

Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock, all Democrats, won in the Peach State. There has been a raging debate in Georgia political circles since then as to whether these races signal a long-term left turn toward the Democratic Party, caused by shifting demographics, or whether they were merely a negative reaction to former President Donald Trump. Tuesday’s results point strongly to the latter.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp, who had rebuffed Trump’s demand to overturn the 2020 presidential result, cruised to a convincing reelection on Tuesday with a pro-growth message by defeating the Democrats’ rising star Stacey Abrams by some 300,000 votes. His coattails also propelled other Republican state candidates to victory – including the Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who had also defied the former President – and helped to keep the Georgia General Assembly firmly in GOP hands.\n\nHowever, before sliding Georgia from a purple political state back into the solid red state column, we still have one more contest to look forward to: a runoff for the US Senate, echoing what happened in Georgia’s last set of Senate races.\n\nGeorgia requires candidates to win over 50% of the vote and the presence of a Libertarian on the ticket has thrown the heated race between Warnock, the incumbent senator and senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Georgia football great Herschel Walker into an overtime runoff campaign to be decided on December 6.\n\nBoth Walker and Warnock survived November 8 to fight another day despite different strong headwinds facing each of them. For Warnock, it has been Biden’s low favorability rating – hovering around 40% nationwide, and only 38% in Georgia, according to Marist. For Walker, it has been the steady drumbeat of personal allegations rolled out over the past few months, some admitted to and others staunchly denied.\n\nWarnock has faced his challenge by emphasizing his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues and occasionally disagreeing with the President on others. Walker, who is backed by Trump, has pulled from the deep well of admiration many Georgians feel for the former college football star.\n\nBoth of these strategies were strong enough to get them into a runoff, but which strategy will work in that arena? The answer could be crucial to determining which party controls the US Senate, depending on the result of other races that have yet to be called. Stay tuned while Georgians enjoy having the two candidates for Thanksgiving dinner and into the holiday season.\n\nEdward Lindsey is a former Republican member of the Georgia House of Representatives and its majority whip.

Mack Donnell Harmon\n\nIn his bid to win a seat in the US Senate, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to appeal to working class voters who felt abandoned by establishment Democrats. Those blue collar voters – many of them formerly members of his party – overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for Ryan, his strategy failed. He lost to J.D. Vance by a decisive margin, according to election projections.\n\nIt was, perhaps, a predictable ending for a candidate who threw away the traditional approach of rallying your base and instead courted the almost non-existent, moderate Trump voter. And it’s a shame. Had Ryan won, Ohio would have had two Democratic senators. The last time that happened was almost 30 years ago, when Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn represented our state.\n\nBut in wooing Republicans and right-leaning moderates, Ryan abandoned many of Ohio’s left-leaning Democrats who brought him to the dance.\n\nThat approach was perhaps most evident in his ads. In a campaign spot in which he is shown tossing a football at various computer screens showing messages he disapproves of, he hurls the ball at one emblazoned with the words “Defund the Police” and dismisses what he disdainfully calls “the culture wars.”\n\nAnother ad showed Ryan, gun in hand, hitting his mark at target practice, as the words “Not too bad for a Democrat” appear on the screen. To imply you’re pro-gun rights when majority of Americans support gun control legislation – and when your party explicitly embraces a pro-gun control stance is bewildering. Ryan’s ads on the economy began to parrot the anti-China rhetoric taken up by Republicans. And when President Joe Biden announced his student debt plan in an effort to invigorate the Democratic bringing economic relief to millions of millennial voters, Ryan opposed the move.\n\nAs a Black woman living in a metropolitan area, I would have liked to see him reach out to communities of color, perhaps by making an appearance with African American members of Ohio’s congressional delegation Rep. Joyce Beatty or Rep. Shontel Brown. But I would have settled for one ad addressing the economic or social concerns of people who don’t live in the Rust Belt.\n\nRyan might have won if he’d gotten the kind of robust backing from his own party that Vance got from his – and if he’d courted his Democratic base.\n\nBrianna N.

Tony Evers surviving a challenge from businessman Tim Michels and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson barely holding off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.\n\nIn late February, Johnson, who Democrats hoped might be a beatable incumbent, was viewed favorably by only 33% of Wisconsin’s voters, according to the Marquette University Law School poll. He was viewed unfavorably by 45% of the electorate with 21% saying they didn’t know what to think of him or hadn’t heard enough about him. He finished the election cycle still seen unfavorably by 46% with 43% of the voters holding a favorable view of him.\n\nHowever, Democrats decided to run possibly the worst candidate if they wanted to win against Johnson. At one point in August, the relatively unknown Barnes actually led Johnson by 7%. But familiarity with Barnes didn’t help him. Crime was the third most concerning issue for Wisconsin voters this election cycle, according to the Marquette University Law School poll, and Johnson’s campaign successfully attacked Barnes for statements in support of decreasing or redirecting police funding and for reducing the prison population. In the end, Johnson came out victorious.\n\nSo, with Republicans winning in the Senate, what saved Evers in the gubernatorial race? Perhaps it was women voters.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade meant Wisconsin’s abortion ban from 1849 went back into effect. Michels supported the no-exceptions law but then flip-flopped and said he could support exceptions for rape and incest. Johnson, for his part, successfully deflected the issue by saying he wanted Wisconsin’s abortion law to go to referendum.\n\nAnother issue that may have soured women voters on Michels was the allegation of a culture of sexual harassment within his company. Evers’ campaign unsurprisingly jumped at the opportunity to argue that “the culture comes from the top.” (In response to the allegations against his company, Michel said: “These unproven allegations do not reflect the training and culture at Michels Corporation. Harassment in the workplace should not be condoned, nor tolerated, nor was it under Michels Corporation leadership.”) Michels’ divisive primary fight against former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also didn’t help his appeal to women voters, especially in Kleefisch’s home county of Waukesha, formerly a key to a Republican victory in Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republicans are going to win in 2024, they need to figure out how to attract the support of suburban women.\n\nJames Wigderson is the former editor of RightWisconsin.com, a conservative-leaning news website, and the author of a twice-weekly newsletter, “Life, Under Construction.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}]}

But despite the inconvenience of shutting down the highway, it’s unlikely any attempts will be made to redirect the lava flow, experts say.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the lava was just 2.5 miles from the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, according to an alert from the US Geological Survey. It had been moving about 40 feet per hour over the last 24 hours, the agency said.\n\nPredicting if, or when, the lava might hit the highway, which connects the west and east of the island, is difficult.\n\n“There are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advances are expected to change over periods of hours to days, making it difficult to estimate when or if the flow will impact Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” wrote the agency in its update.\n\nThis is part of the problem with attempts to redirect the lava flow: lava is unpredictable, and it’s hard to tell where it might go next.\n\nLava’s “tendency to flow is extremely temperature-sensitive,” Paul Segall, a professor of geophysics at Stanford University who researches earthquakes and volcanoes, told CNN. This makes it “somewhat unpredictable.”\n\nIt’s hard to say at this point whether the lava will even reach the highway, Segall explained.\n\nAdditionally, although different countries have tried in the past to redirect their flows, their efforts have mostly been expensive failures. “The history is not successful,” Segall said.\n\nIn the past decades, workers have used bulldozers to construct huge earthen walls to redirect after eruptions like that of Mount Etna in Sicily.\n\nAnd in 1935, Thomas Jaggar, founder of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, called on the US Army Air Corps to bomb the source of lava flowing from Mauna Loa, which was headed towards the Wailuku River, according to the U.S. Geological Service. The army dropped two 600-pound bombs, but they missed their target and had minimal effect on the lava flows.\n\nSome efforts to combat volcano flows have succeeded despite the odds. In 1973, for instance, the Eldfell volcanic eruption triggered a months-long crisis for the small Iceland island of Heimaey. Massive amounts of seawater were sprayed onto the lava to cool it down, which helped prevent the lava from closing off the island’s vital harbor.\n\nSegall also said that increasingly, scientists and residents of Hawaii alike view the lava flow as a natural phenomenon – not something that needs to be disrupted.\n\n“I think there’s a fair amount of sentiment in Hawaii that you don’t mess with Pele,” he said, referring to the Hawaiian goddess of fire. “That this is a natural process.”\n\nUahikea Maile, an assistant professor of indigenous politics at the University of Toronto, echoed this sentiment.\n\nFor Maile, the eruption of Mauna Loa is especially resonant because of its timing. The volcano erupted on November 28th, Hawaiian Independence Day, which commemorates the signing of the Anglo-Franco Proclamation of 1843 which recognized Hawaii as a sovereign kingdom.\n\n“Mauna Loa is erupting on Lā Kūʻokoʻa, Hawaiian Independence Day. Settler society sees her as a destructive threat for containment,” Maile wrote on Twitter. “This is true too for Hawaiian sovereignty. But we are irrepressible. It may be destructive, but it creates life to stand on for generations to come.”\n\n“Like Mauna Loa, Hawaiian sovereignty is seen as something that needs to be contained that needs to be suppressed,” Maile told CNN.\n\nHe noted that Hawaii itself was created as a result of volcanic eruptions. Without volcanoes, there would be no Hawaii.\n\nAnd rather than trying to interrupt natural phenomena like lava flows, he suggested that humans should be more mindful of their own impact on Hawaii. He highlighted petroleum contamination linked to Navy bases on Hawaii, as well as the environmental destruction caused by tourism and the November spill of “forever chemicals” at Hawaii’s Red Hill Naval Facility\n\n“These are forms of unnatural environmental destruction and volatility that should be considered more of a priority than the bombing of lava flow,” Maile said. “Instead of containing lava flowing from Mauna Loa, the US military should clean up their own mess at Pōhakuloa Training Area, and contain ongoing jet fuel and ‘forever chemical’ spills at Red Hill.”\n\nIn the meantime, Hawaiian officials say they have a plan to shut down the highway if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/us/mauna-loa-volcano-lava-flow-and-hawaii-air-quality/index.html", "title": "See the Mauna Loa volcano lava flow and track the air quality in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe lava spewing from the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii continues to flow.\n\nThe leading edge remains at around 7,000 feet in elevation, creeping down the mountain at less than a mile an hour.\n\nBut the magma has slowed significantly and so far poses little threat to local residents, according to Hawaii emergency management officials. While the lava has already crossed Observatory Road, it could take a week to reach the narrow Daniel K. Inouye Highway roughly three miles away, depending on how the lava reacts on the flatter terrain below.\n\nThe volcano erupted Sunday, sending lava toward the northeast. Most of the island’s development is scattered around the coast, so the lava is not currently a threat to people or infrastructure.\n\nThe US Geological Survey, which is monitoring the eruption, said in its latest update that the agency is still detecting tremor signals in the volcano’s active fissures. “This indicates that magma is still being supplied, and activity is likely to continue as long as we see this signal.”\n\nThe eruption happened on the Big Island, officially known as Hawaii, the archipelago’s largest. It consists of five volcanoes — four of which are active.\n\nResidents are used to eruptions. The latest is one of more than 130 eruptions in which lava flowed from fissures in the mountain since the 1830s, according to data released by the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.\n\nThe volcano last erupted in 1984. According to the data, the site has been relatively consistent, erupting 71 times during the 1800s and 68 times during the 1900s.\n\nThe historic lava flows have varied in size and direction, depending on the event, over the years:\n\nWhile the latest eruption hasn’t threatened the island’s infrastructure, it has raised concerns about air quality both for local residents and those living downwind across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSo far, the air quality on the island has remained good, according to the Hawaii Department of Health.

It stretches 10.5 miles from base to summit and takes up half the entire surface area of Hawaii’s Big Island, the US Geological Survey says.\n\nBut compared to its smaller neighbor Kilauea, Mauna Loa doesn’t erupt as frequently. So there’s not as much historical data on its lava and where it travels, said Tracy Gregg, associate professor of geology at the University at Buffalo.\n\nAnd that makes the trajectory of its lava – which can change at any moment – harder to predict.\n\n“But the good news about lava is that – particularly on the island of Hawaii – it doesn’t really sneak up on people. Folks know when it’s coming,” Gregg said.\n\n“So in terms of loss of life, I’m not concerned.”\n\nLava from Mauna Loa was crawling forward Tuesday at about 21 yards per hour, said Mike Zoeller of the US Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nThe lava advance, which recently slowed after hitting flatter surfaces, was within 1.92 miles of the Daniel K. Inouye Highway – the major highway connecting the eastern and western halves of Big Island, he said.\n\nBut all “that could change in an hour,” Gregg said, making the task of guessing which – if any – infrastructure or buildings could be damaged by lava much more difficult.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Mauna Loa’s lava will wipe out homes; the closest major population center is Hilo, about 37 miles northeast.\n\n“In some cases, Mauna Loa flows have traveled as far as Hilo and South Kona, so there certainly might be exposure of communities to lava,” said Einat Lev, an associate research professor in seismology, geology and tectonophysics at Columbia University.\n\n“However, this is very unlikely judging by the length of historical lava flows,” Lev said.\n\nIndeed, “Mauna Loa lava flows have not inundated communities,” Gregg said.\n\n“There have been some scares. Hilo is one of the biggest cities on the island, and in the 1880s, Mauna Loa lava flow kind of crept up pretty close to Hilo – but even then didn’t quite make it.”\n\nRight now, there’s a “small chance that the flow would diverge and turn towards the west,” Lev said, where “it might interact with roads and structures in the Pōhakuloa Game Management Area.”\n\nThe US Army’s Pohakuloa Training Area is about 20 miles north of Mauna Loa. An unexploded ordnance was spotted this week in lava rocks near a Mauna Loa eruption viewing area, Hawaii News Now reported.\n\n“Unexploded ordnance may indeed be found in the area, given its long history as a training area” for the Army, Lev said.\n\nBut there are too many variables – such as how deep the military device is in the ground – to speculate what might happen if a lava reached it, Gregg said.\n\nWhy this Kilauea eruption probably won’t be as devastating\n\nJust 21 miles away from Mauna Loa, Kilauea has been exploding for the past year.\n\nBut unlike the 2018 Kilauea eruption that destroyed hundreds of homes in the Leilani Estates neighborhood, the current eruption is much different thanks to where the lava is shooting out from and how close the eruption is to people.\n\n“Lava from the 2021-present eruption has been confined to the summit crater,” Lev said.\n\nIn other words, lava isn’t gushing down the side of Kilauea right now. It’s staying near the top.\n\n“This is in contrast to the 2018 eruption, when the eruptive vents were located low on the southeastern flank of the volcano,” Lev said.\n\n“There is always a chance that there will be another eruption on the flank, closer to communities, but not from the current location of the Kilauea eruption.”\n\nGregg hopes Kilauea’s eruption stays put, with lava shooting up from and staying within the summit crater, she said.\n\n“If you think of the summit crater as like a bathtub, the bathtub is barely even beginning to be filled,” Gregg said.\n\n“Right now, the lava at Kilauea is behaving very nicely. And we hope that lasts.”\n\nWhy lava doesn’t like to follow orders\n\nHumans in the past have tried to divert or even stop lava from advancing. Workers have used bulldozers to build huge earthen walls to try to redirect lava after eruptions, such as that of Mount Etna in Sicily.\n\nBut “the history is not successful,” said Paul Segall, a professor of geophysics at Stanford University.\n\nIn 1935, the founder of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory asked the US Army Air Corps to bomb the source of lava flowing from Mauna Loa as it headed toward the Wailuku River, according to the US Geological Service.\n\nThe army dropped two 600-pound bombs, but they missed their target and had minimal effect on the lava flows.\n\nLava’s tendency to flow “is extremely temperature-sensitive,” Segall said. That makes it “somewhat unpredictable.”\n\nBut with neighboring volcanoes now erupting simultaneously, scientists are eager to study what will happen next.\n\n“It would be fascinating to see if the eruptions influence each other,” Lev said.\n\nNo matter what happens, Gregg said, residents and tourists should pay attention to warnings from local officials and heed any guidance from volcanologists.\n\n“I think the most important thing is that we really can’t predict what’s going to happen on an hour-by-hour or even day-by-day basis.”", "authors": ["Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-friday/index.html", "title": "Hawaii volcano: Lava flow from Mauna Loa is about 2.5 miles from ...", "text": "Waimea, Hawaii CNN —\n\nAs the world’s largest active volcano oozes molten rock here on the Big Island, a blend of concern and awe has emerged among visitors.\n\nPeople were pulling over in their cars throughout the night to get a glimpse of the striking scene – a blazing river cutting through the darkened horizon.\n\nThey took photos and videos, stood in silence, and even urged others to turn off their car lights for a better, and more reverential, view.\n\nMauna Loa has been erupting for days, with lava shooting to heights of up to 148 feet on Tuesday.\n\n“We weren’t sure which way it was going to flow, you know which way Pele was going to decide to do it. So this was the best scenario for everybody because nobody’s in danger… So you just have to be thankful,” Deborah Westbrook, who had come to see the volcano during the day, said on Friday.\n\nBut, the lava flow from the Mauna Loa is gradually moving closer to the Daniel K. Inouye Highway.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the lava flow had showed little change from a day prior and was about 2.5 miles from the highway, according to an update from the United States Geological Survey.\n\n“During the past 24 hours, the lava flow advanced at an average rate of about 40 feet per hour,” the USGS said. “Though the advance rate has slowed over the past 24 hours, the lava flow remains active. “\n\nOne active fissure is feeding that lava flow, the USGS added.\n\nThe highway remains open in both directions, but the speed limit was reduced to 35 miles per hour in the Mauna Kea Access Road area, according to the HawaiI County Civil Defense Agency.\n\nA traffic hazard safety route is now accessible through Saddle Road, also known as Daniel K. Inouye Highway, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.\n\nThe one-way route “will provide safe viewing of lava flows,” the agency said Thursday, declaring that parking on the highway was putting motorists at risk of traffic citations and vehicles towed.\n\nAmong those gathered early Friday to marvel at the bright orange lava was Ku’ulei Vickery, a native Hawaiian and a teacher at a nearby public school.\n\nShe performed a traditional Hawaiian chant and left rosemary grown in her backyard as an offering.\n\n“As a native, I’m acknowledging the space that I am in.

Gregory Bull/AP\n\nMauna Loa’s lava was just about 3 miles away from Saddle Road, the fastest route linking the west and east coasts of Big Island, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nIt’s unpredictable in direction and impact. But officials say it’s moving so slowly that they’ll have plenty of time to warn people of any potential danger.\n\n“Advance rates may be highly variable over the coming days and weeks due to the way lava is emplaced on flat ground,” the geological survey said in an update Thursday.\n\nStill, the simultaneous eruptions of Mauna Loa and neighboring volcano Kilauea, which has been erupting for more than a year, could possibly put people at risk of inhaling air that’s been compromised, state health officials have warned.\n\nResidents and visitors can expect “vog conditions, ash in the air, and levels of sulfur dioxide to increase and fluctuate in various areas of the state,” the Hawaii health department said.\n\nPlus, a combination of volcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair – which are strands of volcanic glass – could be carried downwind, the geological survey said.\n\nAnd the plumes of dark clouds billowing out of the volcanoes are not smoke – they’re “volcanic gases, which are acid gases. You don’t want to breathe them in,” said volcanologist Jess Phoenix.\n\n“You’re talking hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide. These are all gases that are really not fun for average folks to breathe in, let alone if you have any sort of respiratory issue,” Phoenix said.\n\nPeople stand on lava rock from a previous eruption near the Mauna Loa volcano as it erupts Wednesday near Hilo, Hawaii. Gregory Bull/AP\n\nIn fact, children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions should reduce outdoor activities that cause heavy breathing and reduce exposure by staying indoors and closing windows and doors if vog conditions develop, the health department said.\n\nWhile evacuation orders have not been issued, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said he signed an emergency proclamation as a “proactive” measure.\n\nThe governor acknowledged Wednesday the potential for air hazards and said officials are tracking air quality monitors across the island.\n\n“The concern is about dangerous gases from the fissures. And the most dangerous is sulfur dioxide,” Ige said. “Observing the volcano should occur at a distance.

Inouye Highway,” USGS notes in its latest update.\n\nStill, if lava does cover the roadway and makes it impassable, commuters and delivery companies are in for a hassle.\n\nEmmanuel Carrasco Escalante, a landscape worker, said he would have to decide between the north side or south side coastal roadways to get from Hilo to Kona.\n\n“It’s a hassle to drive all the way around the island,” he told CNN. “If the road closes, that would add almost two hours, more gas, and more miles so hopefully it (lava) doesn’t cross that road.”\n\nAnd though the lava’s path remains unpredictable, the transportation department will be able to provide a six-hour notice of the road’s closure, authorities said.\n\n“And the staff at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory say that they can provide at least 24-48 hours advance warning if the lava appears to be threatening the roadway,” said Adam Weintraub, communication director for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIf emergencies arise during a possible highway closure, there are hospitals and first responders on each side of the island, Weintraub said.\n\nTalmadge Magno, administrator of the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, said authorities will work with shipping companies to make adjustments to limit cross-Island traffic.\n\n“It’s a full community effort that’s going to take to come together if Daniel K. Inouye Highway is taken out,” Magno said.\n\nAs the rivers of molten rock ooze down towards the highway, authorities say the lava poses no immediate threat to any homes.\n\nLava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.

Advance rates will continue to be “highly variable” over the next weeks, USGS noted Saturday.\n\nThe lava was initially oozing down steep slopes, but the flow from one of the fissures has since reached flatter ground and slowed significantly, according to USGS. Three other fissures are no longer active.\n\nStill, it’s dangerous situation on the ground.\n\n“The lava spewing forth is thousands of degrees centigrade and it really is a dangerous situation. And the eruption is unpredictable,” the governor told CNN.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit is about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since last year. The two simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park.\n\n“It is an awe-inspiring sight.

It has canceled five flights to and from Honolulu, Southwest said.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration is “closely monitoring the volcanic eruption and will issue air traffic advisories once the size of the ash cloud is determined,” it said in a statement.\n\nRed hues from the eruption of Mauna Loa illuminated Monday's predawn sky. Courtesy David A. Higgins\n\nReports of lava overflowing into the southwest portion of the volcano’s caldera, or crater, have come in to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency tweeted late Monday morning.\n\nThere is no indication of a threat to nearby communities, and no evacuation orders have been issued, the agency tweeted. As a precaution, two shelters have opened, even as “roughly half” of recorded Mauna Loa eruptions remained in the summit area without threatening populated areas, according to another agency tweet.\n\nAshfall can damage vehicles and buildings, contaminate water supplies, disrupt sewage and electrical systems, and damage or kill vegetation, the weather service says, while abrasive volcanic ash can irritate eyes and lungs.\n\n“People with respiratory illnesses should remain indoors to avoid inhaling the ash particles and anyone outside should cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth,” the Honolulu office warned. “Possible harm to crops and animals. Minor equipment and infrastructure damage. Reduced visibility. Widespread clean-up may be necessary.”\n\nThe observatory said earlier that lava flows do not threaten downslope communities.\n\nAt about 4,000 square miles, Hawaii, or the Big Island, is the largest in size of the Hawaiian chain but has a population of just over 200,000 people, according to the US Census Bureau, or fewer than 50 people per square mile. Most of the population is in cities and communities around the coast.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa eruption can be very dynamic and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the observatory said, adding, “If the eruption remains in Moku’āweoweo, lava flows will most likely be confined within the caldera walls.\n\n“However, if the eruptive vents migrate outside its walls, lava flows may move rapidly downslope.”\n\nRed hues from the eruption illuminated Monday’s predawn sky, according to footage captured at the Kailua Bay & Pier by Matthew Liano, a resident of Kailua-Kona, along the Big Island’s west coast.\n\n“The glow is like nothing I’ve seen here living in Kona for most of my life,” Liano told CNN.\n\nThe eruption began in Moku’āweoweo, the summit caldera of Mauna Loa, on Sunday around 11:30 p.m. HST (4:30 a.m. ET Monday), according to the observatory.\n\nMauna Loa began erupting Sunday. USGS\n\nNearby Kilauea volcano erupting since 2021\n\nMauna Loa, which covers half the island of Hawaii, has erupted 33 times since 1843, the volcano’s first “well-documented historical eruption,” according to the US Geological Survey. It last erupted in 1984, making this prolonged quiet period the volcano’s longest in recorded history.\n\nMauna Loa’s summit crater sits about 21 miles west of Kilauea, a smaller volcano that has been erupting since 2021. Their simultaneous eruptions have created a rare dual-eruption event, according to the park.\n\nKilauea’s eruption is currently confined to its crater. When Kilauea erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nMauna Loa has been in a heightened state of unrest, per the agency, which pointed in an update late last month to elevated seismic activity and increased earthquake rates.\n\nEarthquake activity increased from five to 10 earthquakes a day since June 2022 to some 10 to 20 earthquakes a day in July and August, according to the US Geological Survey. Peak numbers of more than 100 earthquakes a day were recorded on September 23 and September 29, CNN has reported.\n\nThe increased activity prompted Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in October to close the Mauna Loa summit to all backcountry hikers until further notice, though the US National Park Service said the main section of the park has remained open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the Eastern Time equivalents for the ashfall advisory and eruption.", "authors": ["Monica Garrett Dakin Andone", "Monica Garrett", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/opinions/volcano-hawaii-mauna-loa-eruption-science-lev/index.html", "title": "Opinion: I'm a volcanologist.

Her research, funded by the National Science Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, is focused on lava flow dynamics at different volcanoes, including in Hawaii. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii started erupting on Sunday night, many people were already waiting for it. For months, the scientists at the US Geological Survey (USGS) Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) have been noticing inflation of the ground and an increase in seismic activity at Mauna Loa, indicating the ascent of magma within the volcano’s plumbing system toward the surface.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the rate of these changes increased. HVO staff moved from weekly status updates to daily, in anticipation of an eruption.\n\nEinat Lev Matt Patrick, USGS\n\nMonitoring the unrest is just part of being prepared. It is also critical to have detailed plans for what to do when an eruption finally happens. For the population of the island, response plans involve evacuation routes, shelters, supplies and access to the latest guidance from civil defense authorities.\n\nEven though Mauna Loa hadn’t erupted in almost four decades, the communities of the island of Hawaii are well-versed in such plans, thanks to Mauna Loa’s little hyper-active sibling, Kilauea, which has been erupting almost continuously.\n\nOnly four years ago, these communities experienced a major disaster when fissures (volcanic cracks) opened low on the eastern flanks of Kilauea, in the middle of a quiet town, and a months-long eruption devastated the area.\n\nLuckily, the recent eruption of Mauna Loa is less likely to cause as much damage. The lavas are coming out of fissures at a very high elevation, far from any population or property. So far, the only infrastructure that was damaged was a remote mountain road. If the eruption continues at the current rate, it might cut through a highway that links the east and west sides of the island in about a week. This will disrupt the cross-island traffic, from people going to work to transportation of goods, but hopefully will not cause significant property damage.\n\nLike the residents of Hawaii, the volcano science community at large has been preparing its own response plans for an eruption, which includes creating protocols that would ensure that we maximize what we learn from each eruption and unrest event.\n\nSuch plans and protocols didn’t always exist. A widely cited 2018 report by the National Academy of Science pointed out that more efficient coordination and stronger collaboration were needed within the volcanology community in the US.\n\nIn response, a research coordination network, followed recently by a national center, was established to achieve these goals. I was happy to serve as one of the organizers and disciplinary leaders for both.\n\nThrough dedicated workshops, town halls at professional conferences and hands-on eruption simulation exercises, we discussed matters such as data sharing, communication tools and inclusivity. The outcomes are already manifesting in the response to the current eruption.\n\nWithin hours from the start of the Mauna Loa eruption, more than 100 volcano scientists joined a Slack workspace, where they are comparing the predictions of flow models, planning the deployment of instruments and analyzing newly acquired observations. A small, pre-defined advisory committee made of academic and USGS members is streamlining the communication between HVO and interested scientists.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis established and transparent communication channel ensures that HVO staff are free to focus on the immediate needs of the response on the ground, while data that the rest of the community needs gets collected in a coordinated, safe and equitable way.\n\nWe will learn a lot from this eruption, not only about how lava flows behave or how eruptions evolve, but also about ourselves as a scientific community. Both aspects are important to move our science forward and, ultimately, provide us with a better understanding of how our magnificent planet works.", "authors": ["Einat Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/world/gallery/photos-this-week-november-24-december-1/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: November 24-December 1, 2022 | CNN", "text": "In this photo, taken with a long exposure, the Mauna Loa volcano erupts on Hawaii's Big Island on Monday, November 28.\n\nProduced by CNN Digital's Photo Team\n\nThe world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa, erupted in Hawaii this week for the first time in 38 years.\n\nThe eruption started late on Sunday, November 27, sending lava down one side of the volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

Johnson, Karen Fernau and Connie Cone Sexton\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThis list was originally published May 18, 2015, to celebrate 125 years of The Arizona Republic. We've brought it back to help mark Arizona's 106th birthday!\n\nThere are endless reasons to love Arizona, from the universal (diverse scenery, great weather) to deeply personal (met your romantic partner here).\n\nRegardless of whether you're a native or a recent transplant, here are our top 25 reasons -- plus 100 more -- to love Arizona.\n\n1. Grand Canyon\n\nThis is the Grand Canyon State, and we have the license plates to prove it. Mention \"Grand Canyon\" in any corner of the Earth and people will likely say, \"Arizona.\" (If they say \"Las Vegas,\" straighten them out.) Any Arizona-based list has to start with one of the greatest natural wonders.\n\n2. Native American culture\n\nThe state is blessed with museums, villages and natural wonders that reflect the lives and cultures of people who have lived here for centuries. It's a shame \"casinos\" come readily to mind.\n\n3. Sedona\n\nWith red-rock formations rarely found outside Mars, Sedona would be voted \"Best Landscape\" in most states, but not in one featuring the Grand Canyon. Still, Sedona is a beautiful runner-up.\n\n4. Xeriscaping\n\nIt's just another word for trees and shrubs that require comparatively little care. Combine gravel with drought-tolerant plants and you've just freed up a few weekend hours to watch TV instead of mowing and pruning. Unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\n5. Sunrise, sunset\n\nThe hues to be seen when the sun says hello and goodbye are almost always Instagram-worthy. Sure, some of the most incredible -rises and -sets are the result of pollutants, but if you are going to breathe air you can see, it might as well look like this.\n\n6. Decent amount of water for a desert\n\nWhat with all the lakes, pools and water parks in and around the Valley, the ability to escape the heat is never far away. And based on the number of state residents who descend on San Diego each summer, Arizona could probably annex Mission and Pacific beaches.\n\n7. Unpretentiousness\n\nWith a lack of scientific research to prove otherwise, we say Arizona is one of the 10 most easygoing, modest states (excluding time spent in trendy Scottsdale clubs). Shorts, T-shirts and a friendly vibe dominate among people who rarely take themselves too seriously (unless they're trying to be trendy in a Scottsdale club).\n\n8. Pro sports\n\nThe Phoenix metropolitan area boasts teams in seven professional sports — baseball, basketball, football, hockey, women's basketball, arena football and soccer. You know who doesn't have all these options? San Diego. Los Angeles. San Francisco. Seattle. Ha!\n\n9. Climate diversity\n\nArizona is in a continental sweet spot featuring everything from low desert to alpine meadows. We can enjoy a vast carpet of wildflowers in the spring, and a leafy canopy of golds and oranges in the fall. A different weather pattern is always just a couple of hours away. You know what's a couple of hours away during a Northeast winter? More snow.\n\n10. Birdwatching\n\nThose who visit southeast Arizona will be greeted by a bevy of birds, from sandhill cranes to all kinds of hawks, robins and sparrows. Not only is the area home to native species, but it sits along a migratory path that's often busier than Interstate 10, only with chirping, not road rage.\n\n11. Monument Valley\n\nThe Western landscape does not get more iconic than this. Name one other place that's equally associated with John Wayne and the Roadrunner. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park straddles the Utah state line, but the visitor center, scenic drive and View Hotel are all in Arizona.\n\n12. Predictable politics\n\nClose races in which opposing parties nearly split seats can lead to ineffectiveness (case in point: the federal government). That doesn't happen here, where an \"R\" by a name all but guarantees victory. It's so much easier to pass laws without any opposing views getting in the way.\n\n13. Brief state history\n\nArizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912, and is the youngest of the 48 contiguous states. Imagine being a high school student in, say, Virginia, where the state history encompasses nearly 240 years. That's going to take several semesters. Arizona's history can be wrapped up in one, leaving other semesters for photography and culinary arts.\n\n14. Counties bigger than states\n\nArizona's largest county by area (Coconino) is bigger than nine states. Maricopa County is larger than eight states. Even Arizona's smallest county, Santa Cruz, is larger than Rhode Island.\n\n15. Hispanic roots\n\nArizona's culture and history are richer for the strong ties to Mexico and Central America. From art to food to fashion, Latino traditions have given the state much to honor and celebrate.\n\n16. Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nHomes and structures built or inspired by the famed architect draw attention and tourists. Taliesin West in Scottsdale is a mecca for fans and students, and it stands out in a region where tile and stucco are so omnipresent that you'd expect to find the materials on the state emblem.\n\n17. Old West image\n\nTourists, especially those from overseas, still expect to see gun-toting cowboys on horseback rounding up cattle on a cactus-studded plain. And dude ranches offer just that. As well as air-conditioned cabins and Wi-Fi. Even the Old West has to keep up with the times.\n\n18. Pope scope\n\nThe Vatican loves to look to the heavens as much as anyone, and its Observatory Research Group is hosted by Steward Observatory on the University of Arizona campus. The state's weather lends itself to optimal nighttime viewing.\n\n19. Hoover Dam\n\nRetaining as much water as it does puns, this dam landmark is a monument to man's hubris toward nature. Take the dam tour to hear about the dam history, dam power generation and other dam facts. So many dam puns. (Note: Hoover straddles the Nevada state line, but the cool activities are in Arizona.)\n\n20. Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nThe former U.S. Supreme Court Justice is the embodiment of Arizona's pioneering spirit. Her strength and determination made her a force in the male-dominated legal profession, and her name fittingly graces Arizona State University's law school.\n\n21. John McCain\n\nOne of the nation's leading conservative voices, the Republican U.S. senator is synonymous with Arizona. With frequent appearances on national TV talk shows, his authoritative voice is more familiar than most political leaders'. Sure, there was that little slip with Sarah Palin, but all is forgiven.\n\n22. London Bridge\n\nThe British may laugh at how chain-saw tycoon Robert McCullough paid $2.4 million for a sinking bridge (shipping not included) and reassembled it in a small lakeside town. Now the bridge stars in every \"You won't believe what's in Arizona\" list, bringing more than $2.4 million worth of tourist attention to Lake Havasu City. Now who's laughing?\n\n23. Fry bread\n\nKeep your cronuts and your doughscuits and your cup-pies. The simple deliciousness of fry bread is far more satisfying than any trendy pastry hybrid. Sprinkled with powdered sugar or drizzled with honey, fry bread is the perfect dessert. By the way, there are no such things as cup-pies. Yet.\n\n24. Personalized license plates\n\nHave an opinion or cause you want to support on your bumper? There's a personalized plate for you. Arizona offers 51, from Alternative Fuel to Women Veterans. In the unlikely event that you are a veteran who enjoys watching the Phoenix Suns and has kids in the Boy and Girl Scouts who love pets and the Thunderbird School of Global Management, you have six plates to choose from. Decisions, decisions.\n\n25. No daylight-saving time\n\nWhile America springs forward and falls back, Arizona sticks to its time guns. We like our sunrises and sunsets right where they are on the clock, so you can keep your time ambivalence.\n\nExploring\n\nHere are some reasons to love exploring Arizona.\n\n26. Apache Trail\n\nThis winding road into the Superstition Mountains was built in the early 1900s to move workers and supplies to the Roosevelt Dam construction site. It is still unpaved for many miles. You'll pass desert vistas, three lakes and the Old West-style town of Tortilla Flat. In 1911, President Theodore Roosevelt noted the route's beauty: \"The Apache Trail combines the grandeur of the Alps, the glory of the Rockies, the magnificence of the Grand Canyon and then adds an indefinable something that none of the others have.\"\n\n27. Saguaro National Park\n\nYou expect cactus. What you might not expect are ponderosa pines, aspens and fir trees. Yet they all exist in the 92,000-acre park that straddles Tucson like saddlebags. Elevation ranges from 2,300 feet on the west side to 8,482 feet at the summit of Rincon Peak on the east side. Take your pick of scenic drives and hiking trails. There's plenty for cyclists and equestrians to like, too.\n\n28. Antelope Canyon\n\nWho hasn't admired a photo of this canyon, where ethereal light teases rich reds, bright yellows and warm oranges into mind-bending shapes and patterns? The canyon, about 3 miles southeast of Page, has upper and lower portions, with tours available for both. The upper section is a short, flat walk; ladders get you into and out of the lower portion.\n\n29. Schnebly Hill Road\n\nIn a state packed with scenic drives, how do you narrow the choices? If your wish list includes huge views, red-rock scenery and a twisty dirt road, head for Schnebly Hill Road in Sedona. For maximum thrills, start at the top. Snake your way down, stopping at the overlooks so the driver can get a break from concentrating. If you don't want to beat up your vehicle, several companies in Sedona offer four-wheel-drive tours.\n\n30. Prescott lakes\n\nThe otherworldly rock formations of the Granite Dells make Watson Lake one of the coolest day trips you can take from the Valley. Rent a canoe or a kayak to explore the coves, or just sit on a rock at sunset. Nearby Willow Lake has the same attractions. Goldwater Lake, nestled in the pines just south of Prescott, also has a playground, volleyball court, horseshoe pits and picnic ramadas.\n\n31. Wupatki/Sunset Crater Volcano\n\nIt would be impossible to drive the 36-mile road that links these national monuments north of Flagstaff and not imagine what it must have been like when the volcano blew. The impressive Wupatki Pueblo and other ruins indicate that this was a thriving community. The eerie Bonito Lava Flow shows the power of the eruption of Sunset Crater nearly 1,000 years ago.\n\n32. Mogollon Rim scenic drive\n\nForest Road 300 meanders nearly 45 miles atop the Mogollon Rim between State Route 87 and Woods Canyon Lake, providing vistas that range from nice to gorgeous to stunning. You'll pass meadows, thick stands of conifers and a few aspens. There's a good chance of spotting elk, deer and other wildlife. There are several trailheads along the way. FR 300 isn't paved, but it is in generally good shape. Drive with care and you won't need a high-clearance vehicle.\n\n33. Tombstone\n\nTombstone lures Old West buffs like the Louvre attracts art lovers. It is a pilgrimage that everyone who loves Western movies or history — they are seldom the same — needs to make. You can witness shootouts, ride a stagecoach, dress up like a gunfighter or saloon girl, take a Jeep tour into the Dragoon Mountains and listen to the voice of actor Vincent Price describe the origins of the town at the Historama.\n\n34. Japanese Friendship Garden\n\nJapanese Friendship Garden: It's near downtown Phoenix but you might drive right past this tranquil spot. The garden, named Ro Ho En, is designed to be an authentic Japanese Stroll Garden with tea garden and tea house. Set among 3.5 acres near 3rd Avenue and Roosevelt Street, the site offers more than 1,500 tons of hand-picked rock, stone footbridges, lanterns and dozens of varieties of plants. Take a walk, and you'll go past flowing streams, a 12-foot waterfall, and a Koi pond with more than 300 colorful Koi fish.\n\n35. Pipe Spring National Monument\n\nPerched in the desolation of the Arizona Strip, this monument is an intriguing window into pioneer life. Pipe Spring is a water source used by humans for thousands of years and the site of a cattle ranch established in 1870. Guided tours are offered through a ranch house known as Winsor Castle. A museum contains pioneer and Native American exhibits.\n\nArts and culture\n\nHere are 10 things we love about Arizona's arts and culture. Faves range from the Musical Instrument Museum to the acclaimed Childsplay theater troupe.\n\n36. Musical Instrument Museum\n\nSee more than 6,000 instruments from every corner of the globe, from South African guitars built of oil cans to a giant self-playing \"organ\" made of drums, accordions and saxophones. The Artist Gallery shows pop-culture icons ranging from a Vegas-era Elvis jumpsuit to the piano John Lennon used to compose \"Imagine.\" And you can hear music from around the world on Wi-Fi headphones that tune in to the nearest exhibit.\n\n37. Center for Creative Photography\n\nLocated in Tucson, the center aims to offer the \"finest academic art museums and study centers for the history of photography.'' The center opened in 1975 and began with the archives of five master photographers—Ansel Adams, Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, and Frederick Sommer. The collection has grown to include more than 230 archival collections. There are more than five million archival objects at the center, including negatives, work prints, contact sheets, albums, scrapbooks, correspondence, writings, audiovisual materials and memorabilia.\n\n38. ASU Gammage\n\nThis 50-year-old Tempe icon designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is the Valley's home to touring Broadway shows such as \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Wicked\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" — all on the marquee in the coming months. The university-owned venue also hosts cutting-edge dance troupes and concerts by the likes of Philip Glass, who performed his cycle of piano etudes there this year.\n\n39. Ballet Arizona\n\nThe arrival in 2000 of artistic director Ib Andersen, one of the last proteges of the great choreographer George Balanchine, put Ballet Arizona on the national map. In addition to classic story ballets such as \"Swan Lake\" and \"Giselle,\" Andersen has earned acclaim for his annual program of Balanchine's modernist dance.\n\n40. Phoenix Chorale\n\nFormerly known as the Phoenix Bach Choir, the chorus has blossomed into one of the finest in the country under maestro Charles Bruffy. It won a 2009 Grammy Award for best small-ensemble performance for \"Spotless Rose: Hymns to the Virgin Mary,\" and its \"Northern Lights: Choral Works by Ola Gjeilo\" was named best classical vocal album of 2012 by iTunes.\n\n41. Phoenix Art Museum\n\nIt has hosted blockbuster exhibits ranging from Monet and Frida Kahlo to \"The Art of Video Games,\" but the best thing about this museum is the diversity of its offerings. It boasts a fashion-design gallery, an excellent collection of Asian art and a curatorial partnership with the University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography. It also has a movie theater for screenings such as the National Theatre Live series, beamed over from London.\n\n42. Heard Museum\n\nOne of the Valley's top tourist attractions, the Heard showcases Native American art and culture of the Southwest, from historical relics to contemporary art. It hosts popular events such as the Hoop Dancing Championship, Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair & Market, Katsina Doll Marketplace and Christmas Ornament Marketplace.\n\n43. Childsplay\n\nTempe's professional theater for young audiences has made its name developing new works that have been produced by other companies around the country. Its most recent triumph was the dynamically staged heartbreaker \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,\" based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo. Because this company employs full-time actors, it draws its strength from its sense of ensemble — and company artists such as Jon Gentry, Debra K. Stevens and Katie McFadzen enjoy celebrity status among young theatergoers.\n\n44. 'Arizona Bold'\n\nArizona Opera's recently announced initiative aims to bring contemporary works that speak to Arizona's diverse audience. The series kicked off last year with the world's first mariachi opera, \"Cruzar la Cara de la Luna\" (\"To Cross the Face of the Moon\"), and continues in coming seasons with \"Arizona Lady,\" \"The Last Dream of Frida and Diego\" and the world premiere of \"Riders of the Purple Sage,\" adapted from the Zane Grey novel.\n\n45. Taliesin West\n\nArizona's most famous snowbird was the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who began building Taliesin West, his winter home (and a colony for his acolytes), in 1937. Now a National Historic Landmark, it offers guided tours that show how the desert inspired the design of the estate. A Lego model of Taliesin West was unveiled this year in the pavilion room, built of nearly 200,000 toy bricks worth more than $100,000.\n\nHistorical icons\n\nHere are 10 Arizona historical icons we love.\n\n46. El Tovar\n\nEl Tovar hotel at Grand Canyon opened in 1905. Architect Charles Whittlesey wanted to create a dramatic structure reminiscent of a Swiss chalet, then considered very elegant. The hotel was regarded as one of the finest west of the Mississippi. El Tovar has been updated since then, but the expansive porches are the same, and the log walls in the lobby and dining room feel timeless.\n\n47. Canyon de Chelly National Monument\n\nIn the 1800s, Navajos sought refuge from U.S. soldiers in the distant reaches of Canyon de Chelly in northeast Arizona. Pueblo structures still stand under red cliffs, while modern-day Navajos farm the bottomlands. Visitors can drive along the canyon rim and stop at overlooks or take a short hike to White House Ruin. Tours into the canyon, led by Navajo guides, give a better understanding of its past and present.\n\n48. Jerome\n\nThis town was built on the side of Cleopatra Hill during the copper boom in territorial days. Today, it is a funky, friendly place to explore. Don't miss Jerome State Historic Park — the mansion doesn't just tell the story of mining magnate James Stuart Douglas. It also describes the boomtown his mine created, how everything evaporated so quickly and how the city found new life.\n\n49. Tovrea Castle\n\nItalian immigrant Alessio Carraro built the Phoenix \"wedding cake\" castle from 1928 to 1930 with hopes of turning it into a hotel and housing subdivision. His dreams were short-lived; a feedlot expanded next door. Cattleman E.A. Tovrea purchased the castle in 1932 and moved in with his wife, Della. He died within a year but his widow lived there until 1969. The city bought it in 1993 and recently opened it for tours.\n\n50. Orpheum Theatre\n\nThe nearly 1,400-seat theater in downtown Phoenix started as part of the national Orpheum Circuit chain, which presented vaudeville acts. The theater, designed with Spanish medieval and Baroque touches, opened in 1929. Through the Great Depression and World War II, residents stayed up to date via newsreels shown at the theater. Later, it operated as a movie theater and then a venue for plays and musicals. The building fell into disrepair and demolition was considered until the city bought it in 1984. It underwent a 12-year, $14 million renovation and now hosts a variety of arts productions.\n\n51. Hubbell Trading Post\n\nPart museum, part art gallery and part grocery store, Hubbell Trading Post on the Navajo Reservation is a portal through time. High counters and shelves are stocked with everything from blankets and baskets to clothing and kitchen utensils. Wood floors creak delightfully with every step. The 160-acre national historic site also includes barns, corrals, farm machinery, wagons and animals, including Churro sheep and their prized wool.\n\n52. Whiskey Row\n\nThe heart of Prescott is bustling Courthouse Square, where the Old West's architecture and spirit are still intact. Whiskey Row makes up the square's western edge. Most of the buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1905, after a massive fire leveled the original block. Locals and visitors takes advantage of pub crawls, festivals and art walks nearly every weekend of the year.\n\n53. Bisbee\n\nThis southeast Arizona community, once a booming copper-mining town, has reinvented itself as a quirky arts community. Most of the lodging offerings are in cool historical buildings downtown or renovated homes and cottages on side streets.\n\n54. Pueblo Grande\n\nThis museum and archaeological site in Phoenix is home to a 1,500-year old Hohokam village. Walk the outdoor trail and explore the structures, and then learn about the Hohokam people in the main gallery. The museum features a gallery and museum store, and provides educational programs.\n\n55. Heritage Square\n\nThe square in downtown Phoenix dates to the late 1800s, shining a light on the city's Victorian past. The Rosson House Museum gives a glimpse of family life in those days. Also in the square are the famous Pizzeria Bianco, high-end Japanese restaurant Nobuo at Teeter House and the Rose & Crown Pub. Concerts, festivals and weddings regularly take place in the square.\n\nGetting out\n\nHere are some reasons to love getting out in Arizona.\n\n56. Phoenix Zoo\n\nVoted a top zoo for kids, the Phoenix Zoo features 125 acres of family-friendly entertainment. Visitors enjoy a variety of interactive experiences, from the Giraffe Encounter to Stingray Bay to the Monkey Village. The Safari Train circles the park as guides offer tips. The zoo also hosts such popular special events such as the ZooLights holiday display.\n\n57. Desert Botanical Garden\n\nLearn about Sonoran Desert plants, trees and flowers as you stroll pathways through cactuses and succulents. There's always something going on, such as the Music in the Garden series, art exhibits, plant sales, workshops and special events such as the holiday luminaria display. Gertrude's restaurant is popular.\n\n58. Pat's Run\n\nThis fundraiser started in a way that almost surely would have met with its namesake's approval — three friends kicking around ideas over beers. Pat Tillman's friends wanted to raise money for the foundation created after Tillman, the former Arizona State University and Arizona Cardinals defensive standout, was killed while serving with the Army Rangers in Afghanistan. Pat's Run now is the largest timed running event in the Southwest U.S. Nearly 30,000 people run and walk 4.2 miles each April to celebrate his spirit and remember his sacrifice.\n\n59. Deer Valley Rock Art Center\n\nMore than 1,500 petroglyphs are scattered around the center in north east Glendale, offering a multifaceted view of the past. The drawings, most made with stone tools thousands of years ago, are open to interpretation. The rock art symbols are found as you walk along the quarter-mile path, which has signs pointing out some of the symbols among the outcroppings of dark andesite.Rock art is a collective name for the types of images created on stone: petroglyphs and pictographs. Petroglyphs are pecked, engraved or polished designs on rock; pictographs are painted or drawn designs on rock.\n\n60. Downtown Phoenix arts scene\n\nThe First Friday art walk has been giving life to galleries and opportunity to artists since 1994. Phoenix's artsy neighborhoods are spread about in typical Valley fashion, with popular areas including the Phoenix Art Museum and Heard Museum; the Roosevelt Row Arts District; and the Lower Grand Avenue Arts and Small Business District. You also will find a vibrant Latino-art scene and skillful graffiti.\n\n61. Sahuaro Ranch\n\nDid you know date-palm trees can live for more than 100 years? They do, and you can see many fine specimens at the Sahuaro Ranch Park Historic Area in Glendale, which also features historical buildings, barnyard and fruit orchards. Tour the historic Main House Museum, built from 1891 to 1898, and learn about the history of the pioneers who lived there.\n\n62. Mystery Castle\n\nThe home at the base of South Mountain was built by Boyce Gulley in the 1930s. He moved from Seattle to Phoenix with a fond memory: building sand castles with his daughter, Mary Lou. He set out to build her a \"permanent sand castle\" using cheap and found materials, including salvaged rail tracks, telephone poles, adobe, automobile parts and stone. Gulley died in 1945; Mary Lou died in 2010. Tours are offered October through May.\n\n63. Scottsdale nightlife\n\nDowntown Scottsdale draws locals and tourists with its Western boutiques, great dining and walkable area. And when the sun goes down, it turns into a partier's paradise. You can drop into a Vegas-style pool club where a top international DJ is performing, walk a couple of doors down to a modern country bar owned by Dierks Bentley, hear a band at an old cowboy saloon, then play arcade games while drinking craft beer.\n\n64. Car auctions\n\nNumerous auctions draw big wheels to the Valley every January. The largest and best known is the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction, which brings in a diverse crowd ranging from international buyers to families looking for a fun day out. Other major auctions include Russo and Steele, Gooding & Co., Bonhams and RM.\n\n65. Waste Management Phoenix Open\n\nThis is the largest tournament on the PGA Tour and known for its rowdy atmosphere. Thousands of fans descend on TPC Scottsdale to sip beer in the sun, show off goofy golf attire and cheer or heckle at the infamous 16th hole. At night, visitors make their way to the Coors Light Birds Nest to party as top bands perform.\n\nHiking\n\nNeed more reasons to love this state? Check out these 10 hikes\n\n66. Camelback Mountain\n\nThe wildly popular Echo Canyon Trail is loved by locals and tourists alike. Any day of the week you can see fitness-minded hikers powering their way around those making their way up for a panoramic view of the Valley. It's a tough hike, with about 1,200 feet of elevation gain over 1.3 miles.\n\n67. Piestewa Peak\n\nThere are several trails in the Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area. The most popular — and most difficult — is the Summit Trail up Piestewa Peak. It's about 1.2 miles to the top and an elevation gain of nearly 1,200 feet.\n\n68. Shoshone Point, Grand Canyon\n\nOn most days, this easy walk through the woods might be the most peaceful place on the South Rim. The flat hike is about a mile along an old Jeep road to a gobsmacking overlook. The small parking area is unmarked, so a lot of people don't realize the trail is there. The point can be reserved for weddings and other events, so if a group has reserved the site you might encounter a crowd.\n\n69. Humphreys Peak\n\nArizona's highest mountain — it tops out at 12,633 feet — offers a lung-searing, heart-pounding hike with amazing views. The trail to the summit winds up the aspen-covered mountain. The last mile, above tree line, is especially challenging as it grows windy, steeper and rockier.\n\n70. Thunder River-Deer Creek Loop, Grand Canyon\n\nThis 28-mile North Rim trek has it all. First, a leisurely walk through the woods and then a skid down a steep gravel slope. Then — ahh — the flat, otherwordly rockscape of the Esplanade. Then — ugh — the Redwall descent. Then Surprise Valley, another reasonably flat and pleasing stretch. Then more downhill until you reach Thunder River, where the water roars out of the Canyon wall and creates a lush microclimate. Soak your feet, because there's still another mile of grinding downhill to the Upper Tapeats campsite. From here to the Colorado River you'll cross Tapeats Creek several times, scramble across a stretch of trail with a sheer drop-off, then pick your way down a rock fall. Good times. The next day it's a few easy miles to Deer Creek Narrows, a fantastic slot canyon. You hike along a ledge near the top of the slot, so watch your step. And get a good rest. Because it's all uphill from here.\n\n71. Aravaipa Canyon\n\nThis peaceful getaway southeast of Globe shows how fertile the desert can be when you add water. A creek waters a canopy of trees, creating a cool, shady ecosystem. Trails vanish into thickets, pushing hikers into the creek. To keep the canyon special, the Bureau of Land Management limits visitation and requires a permit.\n\n72. Superstition Mountains\n\nGrisly murders, strange disappearances and legends of lost mines have given the Superstition Mountains an ominous reputation. But the 160,000-acre wilderness holds some of the best hiking in Arizona, with everything from jagged cliffs and deeply shadowed canyons to rolling, pine-covered hills and seasonal creeks. And its 200 miles of interconnecting trails make it easy to plan a hike for every skill and adventure level.\n\n73. Cathedral Rock\n\nAs you approach Sedona from the south, this dramatic cream- and salmon-colored formation stands as a sort of gateway to the backcountry marvels beyond. See for yourself by hiking the Cathedral Rock Trail up to the base of the cliffs and pillars at the center of the formation. Although it's only about three-quarters of a mile long, the trail gains more than 700 feet of elevation.\n\n74. Wind Cave Trail\n\nThis trail begins in Usery Mountain Regional Park and enters Tonto National Forest. The wide, sandy trail zigzags through lush desert, steadily gaining elevation. As it steepens, it leads along the base of lichen-stained cliffs to the cave. A handful of plants cling to the ceiling, where water seeps through the rock.\n\n75. Arizona Trail\n\nThe Arizona National Scenic Trail is like an 800-mile sampler of everything Arizona has to offer. The trail's 43 \"passages\" range in length from 8.3 miles to 36 miles and link the Mexican border south of Parker Lake in the Huachuca Mountains to the Utah state line beyond the Grand Canyon. They traverse mountain ranges, grasslands, desert, forests, wilderness areas and canyons.\n\nWeather\n\nFrom summer storms to fair winters, here are 10 reasons to love Arizona weather.\n\n76. Beauty in the skies\n\nWhile summer storms can be dangerous (and should be viewed from indoors), there is beauty there, too. Monsoon clouds appear heavenly and white as they build over the eastern mountains, then transform to dark and menacing with angry flashes of lightning that paints electrifying pictures across the summer sky. And then, when the night sky clears, you don't have to travel far from the Valley for breathtaking views of the heavens.\n\n77. Dining al fresco in winter\n\nDuring the heat of summer, most Valley residents want to spend as much time in air-conditioned spaces as possible. But during the rest of the year, conditions are great for dining outdoors. Metro Phoenix has a great variety of eating establishments small and large that feature outdoor dining, some with incredible city, mountain and desert vistas.\n\n78. Experiencing all 4 seasons\n\nArizona residents can experience all four seasons, sometimes in just a few hours. Traveling from the desert floor to Arizona's \"sky islands\" can take you from searing heat to snowy peak in the time it takes to drive to Flagstaff, which is the place to be for vibrant fall colors as well as snowball fights in the winter. In spring, the wildflowers near Picacho Peak can't be beat, but if it's summer you want, well, welcome to Arizona, because we've got plenty of that.\n\n79. Fall and winter festivals\n\nDuring the fall, winter and early spring, Arizonans like to get outdoors to participate in fairs, festivals and other special events. Nearly every weekend during the cooler months features some sort of outdoor event, whether its food, or music or even medieval jousting at the Renaissance Faire.\n\n80. Creosote bush\n\nRepublic columnist Clay Thompson was once asked about the \"pleasantly sweet smell\" that comes from the desert after a rain. His guess was the Creosote bush. Its stems and leaves are covered with a waxy substance that includes naphthalene, which protects the plant from ultraviolet rays and helps it hold in water. \"Moisture activates the waxy coating and produces that wonderful smell,\" he explained.\n\n81. 90 degrees\n\nHave you ever noticed how 90 degrees in the summer doesn't feel the same as 90 degrees in spring? After suffering through temperatures of 105-plus during July and August, it's almost blissful when the day comes that it only gets as high as 90. But head from winter into spring with temperatures suddenly spiking to 90 degrees and, it's starting to feel pretty warm.\n\n82. It really is a dry heat\n\nThen again, so is a sauna. Still, it's nice to be able to hang your laundry on the line and have it dry in 20 minutes.\n\n83. Skiing\n\nWater. Downhill. Cross-country. You can do all three kinds of skiiing in Arizona, sometimes on the same day if you're willing to do a little driving. Arizona Snowbowl and Sunrise Park Resort are popular ski destinations, along with Mount Lemmon Ski Valley near Tucson. You can cross-country ski along the Mogollon Rim near Payson, and the major lakes on the Salt and Verde rivers offer water skiing year-round.\n\n84. Swimming season never ends\n\nDespite the way it may look when you fly into Sky Harbor International Airport, everyone in Arizona does not have a swimming pool. But they probably know someone who does. If not, they can take advantage of the dozens of resort pools that are open year-round or splash in one of the Valley's famous water parks. Back in the old days, kids used to swim in the canals that provide water to the Valley, but these days that's frowned upon. Still, if you can't find a cool place for a dip on a summer day, you're not trying very hard.\n\n85. Backdrop for big events\n\nPleasant fall and winter temperatures draw people to Arizona from across the world. That climate is also an important lure for big-time sporting events such as the Super Bowl or the Phoenix Open professional golf tournament and spring-training baseball.\n\nEating and drinking\n\nThe Arizona Republic has been helping Arizonans for the past 125 know where and what to eat and drink.\n\nHere are 10 reasons worth toasting:\n\n86. Mexican food\n\nThere's no need to travel south of the border for authentic Mexican food. We serve it right here. For decades, Arizona restaurants have been dishing up Mexico's signature dishes.

Yet a devoted band of farmers is turning swatches of desert into bountiful gardens, proving that, yes, locally grown fruits and vegetables are better. Our farmers sell their harvest to chefs and at nearly 30 farmers markets Valley-wide. Here are three operations hard at work:\n\n•McClendon's Select, 15888 N. 77th Ave., Peoria. 623-979-5279, mcclendonsselect.com.\n\n•Maya's Farm, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix. 480-236-7097, mayasfarm.com.\n\n•Singh Farms, 8900 E.

Wine\n\nArizona's wine industry was small and sleepy — until 2001. Since then, winemaking has soared. Production has increased nearly 700 percent in the past 14 years, well above the national average. At the same time, the state's reputation for quality wines has skyrocketed.\n\nThere are 75 licensed wineries in Arizona, many offering tasting rooms at the vineyards.

Thankfully, a handful of restaurants are working hard to keep the cuisine of Native American forebears alive:\n\n•White Mountain Apache Tribe's Sunrise Park Resort: Chef Nephi Craig and his all-Native American kitchen staff host dinners to showcase the cuisine of their ancestors.

Indian School Road, Phoenix. 602-351-2345.\n\n•Kai: The menu at this award-winning, fine-dining restaurant on the Gila River Reservation showcases tribal and regional bounty. Located at 5594 W.

Cactus League baseball\n\nOn March 30, 1909, the Chicago White Stockings became the first major-league team to play a barnstorming game in Arizona. The concept of spring training here didn't really take off for another 40 or so years, but from those first roots blossomed an experience that includes half of Major League Baseball and sets annual attendance records across the Valley.\n\n97. The big four play here\n\nThe Phoenix area is home to all four men's major pro sports leagues, making us one of only a dozen markets in the country that can make that boast.\n\n98. You're covered\n\nThere is no such thing as a rainout or bad weather when it comes to our pro sports franchises. Domed stadiums, a necessity given Arizona's challenging summers, not only guarantee fan comfort but also that the games will go on. Added bonus: Fans don't have to get bundled up and trudge through snow to watch hockey here!\n\n99. Golf mecca\n\nClimate is one of the Five C's of Arizona that built our economy and why we are a year-round golfing destination. Try this formula as an example: 50 or so golf courses in Scottsdale and another 150 in the surrounding area, times 330 days of sunshine, equals an estimated 8.28 million rounds of golf per year on those tracks, per City of Scottsdale data.\n\n100. The great outdoors\n\nMuch of the Arizona sports experience doesn't take place in a stadium or arena, but happens all year long under our sunny skies. If you are a water enthusiast, pilot your boat on one of more than three dozen lakes and reservoirs, plus the Colorado River, or float in an inner tube down the Salt River. Hunters can go for game big or small in the deserts, mountains and forests; fishing opportunities are too numerous to mention here. And hiking and camping experiences offer plenty of diverse terrain, vistas and wildlife encounters.\n\n101. Mega events call Arizona home\n\nSuper Bowls. National championship football. All-star games. And now the Final Four around the corner. The Phoenix area, simply, is where America comes to put on its biggest sports events.\n\n102. Pickleball\n\nParticipants use paddles to hit a ball over a low net on a badminton-sized court. Pickleball is touted as one of the fasted growing sports in the country. The USA Pickleball Association, organized to promote the growth and development of the sport, has its home in Surprise. Although the sport has captured the hearts of those living in retirement communities and RV Parks, a younger crowd is getting in on the action.\n\n103. We're World Series champions\n\nArizona Diamondbacks win the 2001 World Series: The seven-game series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees included two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7, bases-loaded walk-off single from Luis Gonzalez. Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were co-MVPs.\n\n104. Weather, or not\n\nIf you have a hankering to play outside, you don't have to let a little thing like Mother Nature interfere. Valley residents enjoying 80-degree winter days can drive two hours to find snow skiing; Flagstaff-area folks can shake off the cold by driving two hours the other way to find a sunny golf course waiting.\n\n105. Go bowling\n\nSince 1971, there has been at least one college football bowl game in Arizona every season, with a second game added in 1989 and a third on Tucson's wish list. If that happens, the state will host four bowls this winter, capped by the second College Football Playoff title game in Glendale on Jan. 11.\n\nPeople and innovations\n\nMade in Arizona. From a young state isolated from the outside by mountain, canyon and desert have grown remarkable ideas, people and innovations.\n\nHere are 10 people and innovations to love that have come from Arizona.\n\n106. Carl Hayden\n\nHayden represented Arizona for 57 years in Congress, 42 of them as a senator. He was instrumental in passing landmark legislation, including a constitutional amendment assuring the right to vote for women and creation of Social Security.\n\n107. Pima cotton\n\nPima cotton, known for its elegance and durability, was developed on experimental farms near Sacaton. During World War I, the U.S. military liked Pima cotton because of its industrial strength: It was used in airplane wheels, uniforms and wing fabric, among other uses. Now Pima cotton is a go-to material for shirts, towels and sheets.\n\n108. John F. Long\n\nValley developer John F. Long created the affordable housing community, Maryvale, in the 1950s. Long donated land for schools, community centers and parks and had a profound effect on West Valley growth. He died Feb. 29, 2008 at age 87.\n\n109. Navajo Code Talkers\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese intelligence officers kept intercepting and deciphering coded messages, allowing enemy troops and sailors to anticipate attacks. The Pentagon turned to the Navajo Nation. Twenty-nine young men were recruited into the Marine Corps and developed a code using their native tongue, Diné. Its unusual syntax and rules of grammar baffled the Japanese, and America finally gained the advantage of surprise in combat.\n\n110. Active retirement communities\n\nThe new concept of a senior-living community and Arizona's reputation as a retirement haven were spurred by the opening of Sun City by the Del Webb Corp. in 1960. The new community was a hit from the start, as thousands thronged to tour model homes in a community with a host of recreational amenities that redefined the lifestyle of older Americans.\n\n111. Cesar Chavez\n\nBorn near Yuma, Chavez saw his family lose their farm when he was a young child. His parents became migrant workers, and he grew up to become co-founder of the United Farm Workers Union in 1962. Committed to non-violence, he organized boycotts and strikes of agricultural products to bring national attention to the cause of farmworkers' rights.\n\n112. Jet Skis\n\nNext time you're at the lake, take a moment to remember Clayton Jacobson II. In the 1960s, the man who spent many years living in Parker came up with the idea for a personal watercraft powered by internal pump jets. His invention would later be manufactured and trademarked as Sea-Doos and Jet Skis, with sit-down and stand-up models.\n\n113. Tree-ring dating\n\nShort of jumping in a time machine, in the 1800s there was no method to pinpoint dates in archaeology and paleontology — until an Arizona scientist got involved. Lowell Observatory astronomer A.E. Douglass began developing the system of dendrochronology — the science of using tree rings, the growth patterns formed in a cross-section of the trunk — in Flagstaff in the 1890s. Almost 50 years later, he founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Tree-ring dating is still used today, and has become a key tool in studying climate change.\n\n114. America West Airlines\n\nThis startup low-fare airline founded after industry deregulation began flights in 1983 with three aircraft, but its expansion was derailed by a 1991 bankruptcy. It was the first airline to apply for and receive a federal loan after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks. America West purchased carrier US Airways out of bankruptcy in 2005. The renamed US Airways completed a long-sought merger with American Airlines and moved its headquarters to Fort Worth in 2013.\n\n115. Star-gazing discoveries\n\nArizona has been at the forefront of space discoveries and NASA missions. Clear skies and low humidity make the state an ideal site for stargazing, drawing scientists and researchers from around the world. Kitt Peak National Observatory, which is 56 miles southwest of Tucson, has contributed to numerous scientific discoveries, including galaxy rotation curves, galaxy evolution and environment, and research about star formation. According to its website, KPNO has the world's largest collection of optical telescopes.\n\nPoints of Pride\n\nArizona can boast of many attractions, moments of pride and sons and daughters of accomplishment. Next time you want to exercise bragging rights, think Grand Canyon. That big hole in the ground drew more than 4.7 million visitors in 2014. As for manmade attractions, there's the mammoth Hoover Dam or that bridge from London that was torn apart and reassembled in Lake Havasu City. We have plenty of folks to admire, including one who spent decades on the Supreme Court.\n\nHere are 10 points of pride in Arizona:\n\n116. Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum\n\nThe 98-acre Desert Museum, which was founded in 1952, is billed as a fusion experience: zoo, botanical garden, art gallery, natural history museum, and aquarium. It is considered a model for innovative presentation and interpretation of native plants and animals in ecological exhibits. Visit and you can go along two miles of walking paths that take you through various desert habitats. At the museum, you may spot 230 animal species and 1,200 types of plants.\n\n117. Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center\n\nCutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center: From 1922 to 1949, this cluster of white buildings at First and Culver streets was home of Congregation Beth Israel. It then become Phoenix's first Chinese-speaking Christian church and then was sold to a Hispanic church. Today it is owned by the Arizona Jewish Historical Society, which operates it as a museum, gallery and cultural center.\n\n118. Miss Arizona becomes Miss America\n\nIt happened not once but twice. It was a banner front page headline on Sept. 11, 1949. A photo showed the winner, Jacque Mercer, with a parasol, her hoop dress puffed around her. Arizona won the 1965 Miss America title with Vonda Kay Van Dyke.\n\n119. Canal system\n\nDesert dwellers need water to survive, and the Valley might never have been created without the dedication of the Hohokam Indians. Salt River Project officials say the Hohokams set the groundwork for today's extensive canal system, which follows many of the same routes.\n\n120. London Bridge\n\nIn 1968, Lake Havasu City founder Robert P. McCulloch paid $2.4 million to buy the 137-year-old London Bridge, which was sinking and had to be replaced. The bridge was dismantled and shipped via the Panama Canal to California, then trucked to Lake Havasu City and reassembled.\n\n121. Arizona Highways magazine\n\nThe magazine was started in April 1925 to attract tourists. Over the years, the beauty and stories of Arizona have drawn tourists to discover in person what they found among the pages. It has more than 1 million readers today.\n\n122. Women's suffrage\n\nEight years before the nation, Arizona men voted to allow Arizona women the right to vote. The initiative won by a healthy margin and was decided in fall 1912, during the state's first election after obtaining statehood.\n\n123. Old Tucson\n\nIf you have a hankering to visit the old West, Old Tucson should be on your bucket list. Even if you've never been there in person, you may well have seen it in movie or television show. In 2014, the attraction celebrated its 75th anniversary of the building of the original Old Tucson sets in 1939 by Columbia Pictures for the movie, \"Arizona.\" Over the years, millions of people have come to wander into the general merchantile store and other businesses in town, catch a gunfight on the dusty streets and or watch a can-can or two in the saloon.\n\n124. Buffalo Soldiers\n\nIn 1913, a fort in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona became home to the Army's 10th Cavalry, one of two African-American cavalry units Native Americans referred to as Buffalo Soldiers. The units were formed in 1866, while the Army was segregated, to help control the frontier.\n\n125. Mission San Xavier del Bac\n\nIf you are headed to Tucson, why not include in your visit, this mission. It's just 9 miles south of downtown Tucson. Another plus: no admission charge but many people will leave a donation after seeing what some say is the finest example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States. The mission, which is designated a National Historic Landmark, was founded as a Catholic mission by Father Eusebio Kino in 1692. Construction of the current church began in 1783 and was completed in 1797. Its interior is filled with original statuary and mural paintings. Today, it continues to minister to the religious needs of its parishioners.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/15"}]}

Are you still in bed? Are there piles of clothes and takeout food boxes strewn across the floor? Do you have chip crumbs on your sheets? Have you broken your self-care routine more times than you can count? Do you not even care? If so, you might already be in “goblin mode” – chosen by the public as the 2022 Oxford word of the year.\n\nAccording to Oxford University Press (OUP), publishers behind the Oxford English Dictionary, the slang term refers to a type of behavior which is “unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” – traits that may have become familiar to many during lockdown.\n\nSocial media can portray idealized versions of self-improvement, from waking at 5 a.m. and drinking a green smoothie, to keeping a journal, exercising and planning your weekly meal prep.\n\nThat era may be on the way out. In its place is goblin mode – the opposite of trying to better yourself.\n\nThe OUP word of the year – also known as the Oxford word of the year – was chosen by the public for the first time. A group of lexicographers at OUP gave people a choice of: “Goblin mode,” “metaverse,” and “#IStandWith.”\n\n“Goblin mode” triumphed, racking up 318,956 votes – 93% of the total. “Metaverse” came second and “#IStandWith” came third.\n\nCasper Grathwohl, president of OUP’s Oxford Languages, said in a press release Monday that the “level of engagement with the campaign caught us totally by surprise.”\n\n“Given the year we’ve just experienced, ‘Goblin mode’ resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point. It’s a relief to acknowledge that we’re not always the idealized, curated selves that we’re encouraged to present on our Instagram and TikTok feeds,” he said.\n\n\"Goblin mode\" was a resounding favorite among voters. ljubaphoto/E+/Getty Images\n\nThe rise of ‘goblin mode’\n\nThe term was first used in 2009 but went viral on social media earlier this year, OUP said. It shot to prominence after a fake headline claimed that the rapper formerly known as Kanye West and Julia Fox broke up after she “went goblin mode.”\n\n“The term then rose in popularity over the months following as Covid lockdown restrictions eased in many countries and people ventured out of their homes more regularly,” according to the OUP.\n\n“Seemingly, it captured the prevailing mood of individuals who rejected the idea of returning to ‘normal life’, or rebelled against the increasingly unattainable aesthetic standards and unsustainable lifestyles exhibited on social media.”\n\nThe term’s popularity may also be linked to the growth of new social media sites like BeReal, where users are invited once a day at random to post a photo of whatever they’re doing. Goodbye carefully curated social media feeds. Hello goblin mode.\n\nThe release gives examples of examples of when the term has been used. Among the most vivid was quoted in The Guardian: “Goblin mode is like when you wake up at 2am and shuffle into the kitchen wearing nothing but a long t-shirt to make a weird snack, like melted cheese on saltines.”\n\n“People are embracing their inner goblin, and voters choosing ‘goblin mode’ as the Word of the Year tells us the concept is likely here to stay,” added Grathwohl.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/us/five-things-december-6-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Dec. 6: Georgia runoff, Hawaii volcano ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

After an impressive early voting period, voters in Georgia will head to the polls today to cast their ballots in what is expected to be a tight race, with both parties and allied groups pouring tens of millions of dollars into a contest that will shape the balance of power in the Senate over the next two years. While Democrats have already clinched control of the chamber, a victory for Warnock would give Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer a vote to spare and prevent any single lawmaker from possibly holding up the passage of legislation.\n\n2. Hawaii volcano\n\nOfficials in Hawaii have activated the state’s National Guard as lava from the eruption of Mauna Loa steadily inches closer to a critical highway. The fountains of lava that have been shooting from the volcano over the past week are not a threat to communities or property, officials have maintained, but the direction of the flow is threatening to shutter parts of the Daniel K. Inouye Highway that links the east and west sides of the Big Island. Closing the road would lengthen residents’ commutes by hours, creating “a tremendous inconvenience,” former Hawaii Gov. David Ige told CNN. Still, many have flocked to see the rare sight of Mauna Loa spewing lava at the same time as the nearby Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting since last year.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN gets rare access to Mauna Loa volcano 03:53 - Source: CNN\n\n3. SCOTUS\n\nConservative members of the Supreme Court appeared to side with a graphic designer who doesn’t want to work with same-sex couples on their wedding websites. The conservative justices suggested that an artist or someone creating a customized product could not be forced by the government to express a message that violates her religious beliefs. Meanwhile, supporters of LGBTQ rights and the state of Colorado – where the business is located – responded that the designer is simply seeking a license to discriminate in the marketplace. A decision in the case is expected by July. This comes as supporters of LGBTQ rights fear the 6-3 conservative majority on the high court may be setting its sights on reversing a landmark 2015 opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Artist explains why she thinks she shouldn't have to work with same-sex couples 04:52 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Flu vaccine\n\nThe flu vaccine appears to be “a very good match” to the strains currently circulating, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a news briefing Monday. However, she noted that flu vaccinations are lagging behind the pace of previous years – even as the virus continues to intensify across the country. CDC data shows that nearly 20,000 people in the US were admitted to the hospital for flu during the week of Thanksgiving, almost double the number of admissions from the week before. There have been at least 8.7 million illnesses, 78,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths from influenza this season, according to the CDC’s latest estimates.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Triple threat emerging: flu, Covid, RSV 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Ukraine\n\nRussia launched a fresh barrage of missiles toward Ukraine on Monday as it accused Kyiv of striking military airfields deep inside its territory. The attacks cut off water and electricity supplies in some areas amid freezing temperatures and killed at least one person, local authorities said. The port city of Odesa appears to be among the worst affected regions as officials say “all pumping station and reserve lines are without power – thus consumers don’t have water.” In Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, about 40% of people are without power after an energy facility was hit on Monday, military officials said. Despite the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed a high success rate in intercepting the Russian missiles.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows explosion at air base in Russia 02:22 - Source: CNN\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSee Robin Meade’s final sign-off during HLN’s final live broadcast\n\nAfter a 40-year run, HLN’s live news programming has come to an end.

But this year, it’s not a word.

Have you been accused of being woke? Are you anti-woke? Just what is wokeness, anyway?\n\nBlack Americans and allies fighting to bring attention to racial injustice and police brutality urge others to get and stay woke. Some companies and politicians try to embody the concept, others hope to capitalize on the perception of it. Some conservatives fight against wokeness because they see it as performative and liberal indoctrination.\n\nThe Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (Stop WOKE) Act proposed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year empowers citizens to go after “woke indoctrination.” The bill blunts what he has warned is liberal ideology influencing the teaching of history in schools and coursing through corporate diversity training. Stop WOKE prohibits any teaching that could make students feel they bear personal responsibility for historic wrongs because of their race, color, sex or national origin, and blocks businesses from using diversity practices or training that could make employees feel guilty for similar reasons.\n\n“We’re going to teach honest history,” said Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland. “But we’re not going to influence it with personal opinion.”\n\nDemocratic critics called it a way to whitewash history and diminish the abuse and inequities faced by minorities in the country, as well as a way for Republicans to satisfy their voting base.\n\n“This is the red meat they want,” Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami said. “But this is not what our state needs.”\n\nStop WOKE Act:New limits on talk of race in schools and work sent to Florida Gov. DeSantis\n\nMore:COVID-19 crusader Gov. DeSantis gets new title: Chief of ‘woke’ police\n\nStopping 'woke' businesses:DeSantis wants to limit investment firms from basing business decisions on moral values\n\nRecently, after Bob Chapek, the CEO of Disney World criticized Gov. DeSantis over the \"Parental Rights in Education\" legislation critics dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, the governor lashed out against the company's wokeness while accusing Disney of interfering with parents' rights and taking money from China.\n\n\"In Florida our policy's going to be based on the best interest of Florida citizens, not on the musing of woke corporations,\" DeSantis said.\n\nAre we all talking about the same thing?\n\nFor a long time \"woke\" just meant \"not sleeping.\"But recognizing its changing common usage, Meriam-Webster added a new meaning in 2017:\n\nU.S. slang meaning \"aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\"\n\nThey took their time. \"Woke\" has been around for much, much longer than that in Black communities.\n\nWhere did 'woke' come from?\n\n\"It can be hard to trace slang back to its origins since slang’s origins are usually spoken,\" Merriam-Webster's update says, \"and it can be particularly difficult to trace a slang word that has its origins in a dialect.\"\n\nThe earliest recorded usage of wokeness that can be interpreted to mean stay aware, rather than wake up, is in a collection by Jamaican philosopher and Harlem activist leader Marcus Garvey in 1923 which included the call, \"Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa\" in a plea for Black people across the world to open their eyes to racial subjugation and get involved in politics.\n\n'Fight for your own liberation':From Jamaica's Marcus Garvey came an African vision of freedom\n\nA few years later, in a recorded spoken afterword to the 1938 song \"Scottsboro Boys\" by blues musician Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) about nine Black teenagers accused of raping two white women, he says, \"I advise everybody, be a little careful when they go along through there – best stay woke, keep their eyes open.\"\n\nIn Black communities in the early to mid-20th Century as the Ku Klux Klan re-emerged, mob justice and lynchings were not uncommon, and segregation and Jim Crow laws were often harshly — or fatally — enforced, \"stay woke\" came to mean to stay vigilant in a world stacked against you.\n\nThe word eventually spread outside the Black community along with other African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) slang. In 1962 Black novelist William Melon Kelley wrote about white beatniks appropriating African American slang in an article for the New York Times Magazine titled, \"If You're Woke You Dig It.\"\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. touched on the feeling in 1965 during a commencement address at Oberlin College: “There is nothing more tragic than to sleep through a revolution. … The great challenge facing every individual graduating today is to remain awake.”\n\nIn a 1972 play \"Garvey Lives!\" playwright Barry Beckham wrote: “I been sleeping all my life. And now that Mr. Garvey done woke me up, I’m gon’ stay woke.”\n\nThe word reached a wider audience in 2008 when Grammy-award-winning singer Erykah Badu covered Georgia Anne Muldrow's song \"Master Teacher\" for her album New Amerykah Part One (4th World War), changing the chorus from \"I stay awake\" to \"I'd stay woke.\" In 2012 Badu used \"stay woke\" in a tweet supporting the imprisoned Russian feminist rock group Pussy Riot.\n\nBlack social media users began using \"stay woke\" more often to point out racial issues, but it also was still used to mean \"watch out for a cheating partner,\" to not fall asleep or to jump on a rising hashtag bandwagon to get attention.\n\nAlso in 2012, neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old student, Trayvon Martin. The hashtag #staywoke was used to spread awareness of the shooting, and of the outrage of Zimmerman's acquittal the next year. With the public outcry, #blacklivesmatter became a hashtag and a movement that only increased as more reports and videos of the shootings of unarmed Black people spread rapidly across social media. #staywoke once again became an urgent warning.\n\nThen, a police shooting brought wokeness into the mainstream.\n\nLess diversity:DeSantis' 'Stop WOKE' Act could force Florida businesses to rethink diversity training\n\nHow did 'woke' become popular?\n\nTwo years later when police officers shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists used #staywoke as a rallying cry to raise awareness about police shootings of Black Americans, along with hashtags for each new incidence of an unarmed Black person killed by law enforcement.\n\nProtests and marches grew nationwide, rising up again with every new name: Eric Garner (who died after being put in an illegal chokehold by police), 12-year-old Tamir Rice (shot immediately and killed by police after officers mistook his toy gun for a real weapon), George Floyd (died in custody after a police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes), Sandra Bland (found dead in a Texas jailhouse after a confrontational jail stop), Daunte Wright (killed during a traffic stop). Breonna Taylor (shot while sleeping during a no-knock raid) and many more.\n\n#SayHerName:Breonna Taylor and hundreds of Black women have died at the hands of police. The movement to say their names is growing.\n\nAdam Toledo, Daunte Wright and George Floyd:Would more de-escalation training stop police from killing people?\n\n\"The word woke became entwined with the Black Lives Matter movement; instead of just being a word that signaled awareness of injustice or racial tension, it became a word of action,\" according to Merriam-Webster. \"Activists were woke and called on others to stay woke.\" The 2016 BET documentary on the BLM movement was called \"Stay Woke.\"\n\n60 years of activism:From the Freedom Rides to BLM, generations discuss work, parallels\n\nAs BLM protests rose up across America \"stay woke\" rapidly became extremely popular on Twitter and became an internet meme. In May 2016, MTV News included it in 10 words teenagers should know. In 2017, it was added to Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary. Essence magazine named its Woke 100 in 2020 and Hulu premiered the TV series \"Woke\" with Lamorne Harris as a cartoonist who always avoided heavy issues awakening to racial inequality (and getting talks from inanimate objects) after getting slammed to the ground by aggressive police officers.\n\n'That's not bringing about change':Obama advises 'woke' young people not to be so judgmental\n\nWhat is woke culture or the woke police? Why is woke used as an insult?\n\n\"Woke\" continued to evolve. White allies of the BLM movement also used the term to signal their support but many gradually began using it to call attention to other progressive issues as well as race such as the #MeToo and #NoBanNoWall movements, which brought accusations from Black commentators of co-opting the term or using it merely to gain activist credibility.\n\n“Most people who are woke ain’t calling themselves woke. Most people who are woke are agonizing inside,” Muldrow told Okayplayer news and culture editor Elijah Watson. “They’re too busy being depressed to call themselves woke.”\n\nConservative commentators who saw the rising BLM protests as violent or anti-police and opposed the movements \"woke\" was being associated with began using it sarcastically, the newest replacement for previous derogatory terms about what they called hypersensitive identity politics like \"social justice warriors,\" \"snowflake,\" \"race card,\" \"virtue signaling\" or the earlier \"political correctness.\"\n\nProgressive arguments or legislation were dismissed as woke and therefore defined and dismissed by conservatives as either insincere plays for attention or overzealous efforts to undermine American values with liberal indoctrination. Many complained of \"woke mobs,\" \"woke culture,\" the \"woke police,\" the \"woke brigade,\" and referred to people with conservative views as \"anti-woke.\"\n\nSen. Rick Scott warned Woke Corporate America that a backlash was coming. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said there would be serious consequences if businesses kept acting like “a woke parallel government.” Former President Donald Trump mocked \"woke\" military generals for being weak and ineffective. Rep. Matt Gaetz kicked off his re-election campaign promising to fight against woke-ism.\n\n\"Woke\" also was tied in conservative media to the phrase \"cancel culture,\" as public figures who said insensitive or racial things (not woke, in other words) faced a backlash and occasionally loss of income or influence because of it, something conservative commentators considered a violation of First Amendment rights and an infringement of their personal freedoms.\n\n\"So in addition to meaning aware and progressive, many people now interpret woke to be a way to describe people who would rather silence their critics than listen to them,\" according to Michael Ruiz of Fox News.\n\n'You will be happier elsewhere, as will we':Palm Beach Police investigating letters warning 'woke' New Yorkers to leave Florida\n\n'Your woke sky':Dictionary.com jabs Republican lawmaker's tweet criticizing 'millennial leftists'\n\nWhat is woke capitalism or woke-washing?\n\nBoth terms refer to companies that showcase their public support for progressive causes but fail to actually do any genuine reform.\n\nHow is 'woke' used now?\n\nThat really depends on who's saying it. By 2021 woke seemed to mostly come from conservative commentators and as part of Republican Party campaign talking points, along with \"cancel culture\" and \"critical race theory.\"\n\nCNN called \"wokeness\" the biggest threat to Democrats in the 2022 election.\n\nIt didn't help that \"woke\" was quickly pulled into pop culture to be further watered down and sanitized. Saturday Night Live presented \"Levi's Wokes\" in 2017. There were How Woke Are You? quizzes on Facebook. The New Yorker asked, \"What's in a Woke McRib?\" BuzzFeed named Hasan Piker the \"woke bae on your Facebook Feed.\"\n\nSome Black thought leaders consider \"woke\" to be problematic, weaponized against them, and largely meaningless now.\n\n\"As is disturbingly often the case, White people (or any racial group outside the term’s origin) will sometimes begin using a term that originated in a community of color often as a term of pride, endearment, or self-empowerment years or decades later,\" said Dana Brownlee in an article for Forbes, \"while either willfully or inadvertently distorting the original meaning of the term.\"\n\n\"It is extremely convenient from a culture-war perspective, to be able to use a word like woke to signal at approximately seven different things,\" said Slate's Rachelle Hampton. \"When you say that “wokeness” is a political ideology, you’re not talking about anything. You’re talking about people who talk about race. And that just immediately brands them as a member of the wokerati.\"\n\nMany still use \"woke\" in its original meaning, though, despite the changes.\n\nContributor: John Kennedy, Capitol Bureau, USA TODAY - FLORIDA NETWORK\n\nC.

Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy.

LGBTQ is an acronym of identities related to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nWhat each letter in LGBTQ means:\n\nIn recent years, many have added I and A — intersex and asexual — to the lineup. The plus sign is another addition to the acronym to represent identities in the community that perhaps don’t fit into the other letters like pansexual, polyamorous, Two-Spirited or others who don’t want to label their sexuality.\n\nThe 'B' in LGBTQ:History, definition, difference between bisexual and pansexual\n\nLearn more:LGBTQ definitions every ally should know\n\nWhat does queer mean?\n\nQueer is an adjective used by those who are not exclusively heterosexual. The term is often used as a self-identifier for those who don't feel their sexuality fits into other terms like lesbian, gay or bisexual. Many LGBTQ individuals feel some labels are \"too limiting and/or fraught with cultural connotations they feel do not apply to them,\" GLAAD writes.\n\nAccording to a 2022 Gallup poll, 0.3% of Americans and 4.3% of LGBTQ Americans identify in the \"other\" category, which includes queer.\n\nReclaiming the word\n\nFor many, reclaiming words that were once used as offensive or controversial is an empowering practice. For others, using that word is a painful reminder of the past.\n\nThe first documented use of queer as a slur was in 1894 when John Douglas, the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, discovered his son was in a relationship with Oscar Wilde. \"Snob Queers\" was used as a derogatory term to describe gay men in a lengthy court case brought on by Douglas. Flipping the term on its head, protesters in the midst of the Aids epidemic began using the word queer in chants — \"We're here, we're queer, we're not going shopping!\" and \"We're here, we're queer, get used to it!\"\n\nIn 1990, activist organization Queer Nation was founded with a mission to increase visibility and decrease LGBTQ violence. Queer Nation mobilized protests, hung banners and distributed pamphlets that read \"We're here, we're queer and we'd like to say hello!\"\n\nWidespread use grew from there. GLAAD officially added the Q to the acronym in its resource guide in 2016, and the Associated Press wrote in 2018 that adding Q to LGBT was acceptable style for journalists. Younger LGBTQ Americans in particular are reclaiming the word as they embrace a shift toward fluidity in identity. But it's still important to keep in mind that some members of the LGBTQ community, particularly older ones who grew up hearing it as a slur, might be uncomfortable with it.\n\nThe bottom line? Let your friends self-identify — don't try to use a label for them.\n\nIs it OK to use the word queer?:LGBTQ folks share perspectives, history of language\n\nThe 'T' in LGBTQ:History of trans rights, plus an understanding of gender identity\n\nWhat does 'questioning' mean?\n\nAccording to GLAAD, questioning is an adjective used to describe the process of exploring sexual orientation and gender identity. It's sometimes used as the Q in LGBTQ in youth support settings.\n\nAdvocacy organization PFLAG puts it this way: \"They have a feeling they might be different but are still in a process of exploration. Using the term allows them to identify themselves as part of the community, while avoiding labels and still honoring that they are in a process of self-identification.\"\n\nSelf-identification is an important part of any LGBTQ person's journey. It's important to remember when talking to friends who are questioning that they do not owe an explanation of their sexuality to anyone, and should feel comfortable to explore it in their own time and way.\n\nResources\n\nIf you're questioning your identity or looking for how best to support your LGBTQ loved ones, these resources can help.

Hence we have 'the rule of thumb.' \"\n\nIn April 1998, the Baltimore Sun investigated the etymology of \"rule of thumb\" and found no clear evidence that the domestic abuse story was true. The Sun suggested the phrase could have come from brewers' practice of using their thumb to test the temperature of beer.\n\n“Despite the phrase being in common use since the 17th century and appearing many thousands of times in print, there are no printed records that associate it with domestic violence until the 1970s, when the notion was castigated by feminists,” explained website the Phrase Finder.\n\nBoth the Sun and the Phrase Finder acknowledged a story in which a judge supposedly told a man he could beat his wife with a stick so long as it was thinner than his thumb. Allegedly, Judge Sir Francis Buller’s 1782 decision inspired cartoonist James Gillray to publish a satirical illustration the following year, which dubbed him \"Judge Thumb.\"\n\nMore:Fact check: Trump could have been exposed to COVID-19 before Sept. 29 presidential debate\n\nHowever, there is no evidence Buller ever made this decision. “(N)o substantial evidence has been found that he ever expressed so ungallant an opinion,” Edward Foss wrote in \"The Judges of England\" after investigating the claim in 1870.\n\n“(F)igures of speech can work much the same way that urban legends do: They may appear mysteriously, spread spontaneously and contain elements of humor or horror. And, like urban legends, a figure of speech may contain a grain of emotional, if not actual, truth,” wrote the Sun.\n\nBoth sources concluded the term is more likely to derive from a thumb’s use for general measurements (distance, alignment, temperature, etc.) than the domestic violence legend.\n\nMore:Fact check: Some of viral post's facts that 'stand up for the Golden State' lack context\n\n2. \"Many years ago in Scotland, a new game was invented. It was ruled 'Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden' ... and thus the word GOLF entered into the English language.\"\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"golf\" was on March 6, 1457, in Edinburgh by King James II. Several sources confirm golf cannot be an acronym because the word was used in different variations before there was a standardized spelling.\n\nAccording to the USGA, \"golf\" is not an acronym but a Scottish adaptation from the Dutch word \"kolf\" or \"kolve,\" which meant \"club\" and was a Dutch game played with a ball and a stick. USGA notes that the Scots adapted the term to \"goff\" or \"gouff\" in the 14th and 15th centuries until it ultimately became \"golf\" in the 16th century.\n\nScottish Golf History suggests the term may have, “derived from Scots words 'golf,' 'golfand' and 'golfing,' which mean 'to strike' as in 'to cuff' or 'to drive forward with violence.'\"\n\n3. \"Each king in a deck of playing cards represents a great king from history: Spades - King David, Hearts - Charlemagne, Clubs - Alexander the Great, Diamonds - Julius Caesar\"\n\nSnopes debunked this claim in 2007, concluding that although the kings on cards had assigned specific kings and queens for a period between the 15th and 18th centuries, the practice was never standardized. Modern playing cards no longer represent specific royals.\n\nThe Atlantic noted that British and French decks of playing cards do tend to feature the same four kings, Charles, David, Caesar and Alexander the Great.\n\n4. \"In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes... Hence the phrase... 'goodnight, sleep tight.'\"\n\nIndiana University's Wylie House Museum debunked this myth in 2018. Wylie House noted that the first documented use of the phrase “sleep tight” wasn’t until 1866, centuries after rope beds were invented in the 16th century. The phrase's late origins indicate it was not in reference to rope bed frames.\n\nWylie House noted that the word \"tight\" was often associated with safety or comfort, like many people colloquially say they are \"tight\" with a friend or family member. \"Sleep tight\" more likely references wishing someone a good night’s sleep than a rope bed frame.\n\nMore:Fact check: Trump sticks with bogus voter fraud claims\n\nThe Phrase Finder investigated the claim and also concluded it had more to do with the meaning of the word tight than the furniture.\n\n5. \"It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink ... this period was called the honey month, which we know today as the honeymoon.\"\n\nCountry Living and Insider both took a look at the claim and found there is more to the story.\n\nThere are several theories about origins of the term \"honeymoon.\" According to a 2016 Country Living article, couples did drink honey-based alcohol on the “moon” after their wedding throughout history. Wedding guests often gifted the couple “mead” in hopes of an early pregnancy since the alcoholic beverage was believed to be an aphrodisiac.\n\nDictionary.com states that “honeymoon” references customs of giving newlyweds mead to last through the sweet period after the wedding.\n\n\"The word may come from the Nordic word ‘hjunottsmanathr.’ This refers to when the groom would actually kidnap his bride and hide her until her family stopped looking for her,\" wedding trend expert Kim Forrest told Country Living.\n\nOxford English Dictionary traced early use of the word to British writer Robert Greene before his death in 1592. Greene uses the word “honney moon” to describe the sweet (like honey) short period of time (like a month or lunar cycle) after a marriage.\n\nMore:Fact check: Chris Wallace visited George Clooney in Italy, not Jeffrey Epstein's island\n\n“Hony mone, a term proverbially applied to such as be newly married, which will not fall out at the first, but th'one loveth the other at the beginning exceedingly, the likelihood of their exceeding love appearing to aswage, ye which time the vulgar people call the hony mone,” wrote 16th century author Richard Huloet.\n\nInsider reports honeymoons didn’t refer to vacations until 1791.\n\n6. \"In old England, when customers became unruly, the bartender would yell at them 'Mind your pints and quarts, and settle down.' It's where we get the phrase 'mind your Ps and Qs'.\"\n\nSnopes found similar claims that \"mind your Ps and Qs\" came from bartenders telling patrons to \"mind their pints and quarts\" to be false in 2010. The term, which was first recorded on 1756, has several possible origin stories.\n\nBusiness Insider investigated the phrase's origin in 2015 and concluded there was no evidence to support the urban legend. The article referred to several versions of the phrase used during the 17th century in a singular rather than plural context to debunk the \"pints and quarts\" theory.\n\n7. \"Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle baked into the rim or handle of their ceramic cups. When they needed a refill, they used the whistle to get some service. 'Wet your whistle' is the phrase inspired by this practice.\"\n\nWhistle has been a metaphor for mouths since the 14th century because it is an instrument for noise. “(W)histle logically calls for wet — similarly, the mouthpiece of a musical instrument sometimes needs to be wetted,” Merriam-Webster explains.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the term came to reference drinking, especially alcohol, over time.\n\nMore:Fact check: Joe Biden faces friendly fire – partly false – over age, pot, prisons and more\n\n8. \"In 1696, William III of England introduced a property tax that required those living in houses with more than six windows to pay a levy.

As the bricked-up windows prevented some rooms from receiving any sunlight, the tax was referred to as 'daylight robbery'!\"\n\nAlthough William III of England did enact a Window Tax that inspired some taxpayers to brick up their windows, the Phrase Finder states the tax is unrelated to the term because the phrase isn’t documented until 1916.\n\nIn 1916, Harold Brighouse’s comic play, \"Hobson’s Choice,\" used the term in a context outside the Window Tax.\n\n“So, if the phrase came from the Window Tax, why no mention of it in print for over two hundred years after the tax was introduced?” asked the Phrase Finder. “Unless and until evidence that relates the phrase to the tax is found we have to say that the origin is unknown.”\n\nMore:Fact check: Girl pictured with Barack Obama in viral posts is his niece\n\nIdiom Origins agrees the Window Tax myth is a hoax. “Daylight robbery is simply what is suggested by the phrase, a robbery that takes place in broad daylight; hence its figurative meaning as a blatant over-charging for goods or services,” Idiom Origins concludes.\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nSeveral stories that explain the etymology of common phrases, terms and symbols are nothing more than urban legends.

The term is still far from being widely used, or even understood, by many French-speakers.\n\nThough at first the change went mostly unnoticed, boisterous debate broke out this week in a nation that prides itself on its human rights tradition but that also fiercely protects its cultural heritage from foreign meddling. In one camp are the traditionalists, including political leaders, who criticize the move as a sign that France is lurching toward an American-style “woke” ideology. In the other is a new generation of citizens who embrace nonbinary as the norm.\n\nMore on pronouns:Lizzo defended Demi Lovato's new they/them pronouns. Why you should respect pronouns too\n\nEducation Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer is not among the latter. He went to Twitter on Wednesday to say that “inclusive writing is not the future of the French language.” The 56-year-old former law professor warned that schoolchildren should not use “iel” as a valid term despite its inclusion in Le Robert, seen as a linguistic authority on French since 1967.\n\nFrancois Jolivet, a lawmaker from President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, also made his distaste plain. Nonbinary pronouns are, he suggested, a worrying sign that France is embracing a “woke” ideology.\n\nJolivet wrote a letter to the bastion of French language, the 400-year-old Academie Francaise, claiming that Le Robert’s “solitary campaign is an obvious ideological intrusion that undermines our common language and its influence.”\n\nThe general director of Le Robert editions, Charles Bimbenet, jumped to the dictionary’s defense Wednesday in a statement. Far from dictating which terms should be used, he said, Le Petit Robert was elucidating the word’s meaning, now it is growing in currency nationwide.\n\nSince “the meaning of the word iel cannot be understood by reading it alone,” Bimbenet said, “it seemed useful to us to specify its meaning for those who encounter it, whether they wish to use it or … reject it.”\n\n“Robert’s mission is to observe and report on the evolution of a changing and diverse French language,” he said.\n\nThe decision has been welcomed by nonbinary French.\n\nBookmark this:LGBTQ definitions every good ally should know\n\n“It is very important that dictionaries include the “iel” pronoun in their referencing as it reflects how the use of the term is now well accepted,” said Dorah Simon Claude, a 32-year-old doctoral student, who identifies as “iel.”\n\n“It is,” they added, “also a way of confronting the Academie Francaise that stays in its conservative corner and continues to ignore and scorn users of the French language.”\n\nIn 2017, the institution warned that moves to make French more gender neutral would create “a disunited language, with disparate expression, that can create confusion verging on illegibility.”\n\nGendered languages like French are seen as a particular hurdle for advocates of nonbinary terms as all nouns are categorized as either masculine or feminine, unlike in English.\n\nNot all European countries are moving at the same speed as France. In Greece, where all nouns have not two, but three possible genders, there is no official nonbinary pronoun, but groups who support them suggest using “it.”\n\nIn Spain, after former deputy prime minister and affirmed feminist Carmen Calvo asked the Royal Spanish Academy to advise on the use of inclusive language in the Constitution, its reply the next year was crystal clear: “Inclusive language” means “the use of the masculine to refer to men and women.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Arno Pedram in Paris, Derek Gatopoulos in Athens, Greece and Alberto Arce in Valbuena, Spain contributed.\n\nIn case you missed:In 102 anti-trans bills in 7 states, the word 'transgender' appears just 7 times.

Clarion-Ledger\n\nProgram stopped accepting patients in 1992\n\nMaximum of 30 were enrolled\n\nEstimated 1 million Americans have legal Rx for pot\n\nOXFORD, Miss. -- The only reason 73-year-old Elvy Musikka still has her sight, she says, is she's been smoking pot for the last 30 years.\n\n\"In 1975, my doctor told me if I didn't start using marijuana, I'd go blind,\" said Musikka. \"Shortly thereafter I found out that, indeed, it was the only thing that would help me with my glaucoma.\"\n\nMusikka is one of only four people still enrolled in the federal government's Investigational New Drug program, which allows a small number of patients to use medical marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi. The program stopped accepting new participants in 1992 but allowed patients already in the program to continue receiving their prescriptions. At its peak, the program provided pot for 30 patients.\n\n\"All of us admitted in the program were required to prove to the FDA, DEA and NIDA that marijuana was the safest and most efficient treatment available for us,\" she said. \"The bottom line for me was that I was losing my sight.\"\n\nFor more than 30 years Musikka has had glaucoma, a disease that causes a gradual increase in eye pressure and can ultimately lead to blindness. Pot relieves pressure in the eye caused from glaucoma and has been shown to occasionally reverse some of the damage caused by the disease.\n\nMusikka recently moved from Florida to Oregon to enroll in a state-run medicinal marijuana program but said she found it to be very expensive. Now that Colorado and Washington have legalized the drug, Musikka thinks access to medical marijuana may be easier and that the marijuana may be cheaper.\n\n\"There is no state, no place, where people do not seriously need this medicine. There is public support for all of us, everywhere,\" she said.\n\nInside the marijuana research lab at Ole Miss, the potent smell of marijuana lingers in the air. The grow room, housing plants that are up to six feet tall, buzzes with the sound of heat lamps and ventilation systems. The entire complex is surrounded by multiple guard towers, two enormous barbed wire fences and countless security cameras.\n\nOle Miss was selected in 1968 as the United States' first, and only, legal marijuana farm since the drug became illegal in 1937 under the Marijuana Tax Act. The pot was grown for research being done by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and was supplied to a small number of patients who were able to prove marijuana was the only therapeutic drug that would alleviate symptoms from their varying illnesses.\n\nAcceptance of marijuana for medical use has come a long way since 1968. Currently, 18 states and Washington D.C. all offer prescription pot. The change has been slow, yet gradual, over recent years.\n\nArkansas came incredibly close to becoming the 19th state last month by trying to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. The measure, known as Issue 5, would have made medical marijuana legal for the first time in a Southern state. The initiative was voted against by 51 percent.\n\nMahmoud ElSohly, the head of the marijuana research program since 1981, said he doubts the new laws in Washington and Colorado will make a big difference to his work, but he said it may cause an increase in drug abuse, particularly among young people.\n\n\"The danger of high-potency marijuana is not necessarily with people that are chronic users of the drug. They probably know how to limit themselves to the right amount of smoke. The problem is with young people who are trying marijuana,\" ElSohly said. \"The psychoactivity of high-potency marijuana is really not a pleasant thing. People get paranoid and very irritable, almost violent sometimes. They get the opposite of the activities sought by the user.\"\n\nWhile high-potency marijuana can be dangerous for some, Musikka believes it's the only reason she still has her vision. She said one of the main reasons she moved to Oregon was to have access to stronger marijuana.\n\nElSohly is concerned about the unregulated market for marijuana. He said that without some type of regulation in place people are subjected to dangerously high levels of THC, the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.\n\n\"They get something off the street without knowing the potency of what they are smoking, and before they realize they've had too much, it's already too late.\"\n\nElSohly said it's also important to remember marijuana is still illegal on the federal level.\n\n\"The United States government is obligated under national treaty to treat marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug,\" he stated. \"We have to make the distinction that this is an approval by referendum, rather than an approval by regulatory testing and due process.\"\n\n\"The people that are pro-legalization, they don't want that, they just want to grow their own stuff and smoke it and be happy. That's it,\" ElSohly said.\n\nMichael Wigginton Jr., former DEA agent and professor of Criminal Justice at Ole Miss, isn't sure that legalization on a federal level will ever happen, much less anytime soon.\n\n\"Federal law is supreme in the United States, it will always override state and local law. Despite Oregon and Washington having legalized and decriminalized possession of marijuana, it doesn't negate federal policy,\" Wigginton said.\n\n\"I don't see any of these legalization measures making any major inroads anytime soon. I don't think the American public as a whole would want to entertain that.\"\n\nElSohly and his team at Ole Miss are working on a new method of administering THC, the main therapeutic component in marijuana. They hope the new approach will decrease some of the unwanted psychological effects and offer a safer way to attain the therapeutic effects of pot, without having to inhale smoke.\n\n\"What we are working on right now is a transmucosal — a small patch that will be put inside the mouth above the gum line. We have support from the National Institute of Health and also from my private lab,\" he said. \"We've concluded the first couple phases, and we are working on releasing it soon with a pharmaceutical partner.\"\n\nRight now, an estimated more than 1 million Americans have legal prescriptions for pot, and ElSohly said attitudes about medical uses of marijuana do appear to be changing.\n\n\"In the past, companies were kind of shying from the idea because it was associated with marijuana, and marijuana is a 'bad word,' so nobody was actually getting into that,\" he stated.\n\nAs for Musikka, her hope is attitudes about the use of medical marijuana are changing, too.\n\n\"We have five generations of lies and misinformation keeping us incapable of rendering rational decisions as individuals, or as a nation, on this issue,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/28"}]}

The suspension will last for at least four additional games, and Irving is also required to satisfy “a series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct,” the Nets said.\n\nWhen asked Friday if there was any consideration of releasing Irving, Nets general manager Sean Marks replied, “No. Not at this particular time.”\n\n“There is going to be some remedial steps and measures that have been put in place for him to obviously seek some counseling … from dealing with some anti-hate and some Jewish leaders within our community,” Marks said while speaking to reporters before the Nets-Wizards game.\n\n“He’s going to have to sit down with them, he’s going to have to sit down with the organization after this, and we’ll evaluate and see if this is the right opportunity to bring him back,” Marks added.\n\nIrving’s Nets teammate Kevin Durant described this week’s matters as “unnecessary” and expressed his belief that the team could have “kept quiet” about Irving’s comments.\n\n“I ain’t here to judge nobody or talk down on nobody … I just didn’t like anything that went on.

I embrace all walks of life. That’s where I sit.”\n\nPressed further to answer yes or no to a question on whether Irving had any antisemitic beliefs, he replied: “I cannot be antisemitic if I know where I come from.”\n\nWhen Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, learned of how the NBA star answered that question, he pointed out that Irving has “a lot of work to do.”\n\n“The answer to the question ‘Do you have any antisemitic beliefs’ is always ‘NO’ without equivocation.

The ADL’s decision to decline the donation was before Irving apologized late Thursday.\n\nThe star’s comments also garnered reproach from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who said he was “disappointed” in Irving.\n\n“Kyrie Irving made a reckless decision to post a link to a film containing deeply offensive antisemitic material,” Silver said in a statement before Irving apologized.\n\nThe controversy comes as antisemitism has been on the rise in the US over the past few years.

I don’t believe everything that everybody posts. It’s a documentary. So, I take my responsibility.”\n\nAsked if he had any antisemitic beliefs, Irving responded: “I respect all walks of life. I embrace all walks of life. That’s where I sit.”\n\nWhen pressed to answer yes or no to the question, he replied: “I cannot be antisemitic if I know where I come from.”\n\nResponding to that answer on Twitter, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League – a “nonprofit organization devoted to fighting antisemitism and all types of hate that undermine justice and fair treatment for every individual” – said Irving had “a lot of work to do.”\n\n“The answer to the question ‘Do you have any antisemitic beliefs’ is always ‘NO’ without equivocation. We took @KyrieIrving at his word when he said he took responsibility, but today he did not make good on that promise,” Jonathan Greenblatt wrote on Thursday. “Kyrie clearly has a lot of work to do.”\n\nThe Nets said in their statement Thursday, “Such failure to disavow antisemitism when given a clear opportunity to do so is deeply disturbing, is against the values of our organization, and constitutes conduct detrimental to the team. Accordingly, we are of the view that he is currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets. We have decided that Kyrie will serve a suspension without pay until he satisfies a series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct and the suspension period served is no less than five games.”\n\nIrving dribbles against the Indiana Pacers during the second half of a game on Monday October 31.

He has failed at almost every step along the way. This suspension is well-deserved,” Greenblatt said. “We were optimistic but after watching the debacle of a press conference, it’s clear that Kyrie feels no accountability for his actions.”\n\nEarlier this week, NBA analyst and Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said he thought the league “dropped the ball” on Irving and that he believed the player should have been suspended.\n\nOn Tuesday, when asked why Irving had not been disciplined for his actions, Nets general manager Sean Marks told reporters: “I think we are having these discussions behind the scenes.”\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was “disappointed” with Irving after the guard did not offer an apology nor denounce the “harmful content contained in the film he chose to publicize.” Silver will meet with Irving in the next week, the commissioner said in a statement Thursday.\n\n“Kyrie Irving made a reckless decision to post a link to a film containing deeply offensive antisemitic material,” Silver said.\n\n“While we appreciate the fact that he agreed to work with the Brooklyn Nets and the Anti-Defamation League to combat antisemitism and other forms of discrimination, I am disappointed that he has not offered an unqualified apology and more specifically denounced the vile and harmful content contained in the film he chose to publicize.”\n\nIrving was not made available to the media on Monday or Tuesday following Nets games on those days.\n\nIrving talks with now-former head coach Steve Nash during a game against the San Antonio Spurs on Friday, January 21, 2022.

He wrote that he meant no harm to “any one group, race or religion of people, and wish to only be a beacon of truth and light.”\n\n“I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day,” Irving said in the released joint statement. “I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility. I do not believe everything said in the documentary was true or reflects my morals and principles.”\n\nIn a tumultuous period for the organization, the Nets also announced on Tuesday that they had parted ways with head coach Steve Nash.\n\nThe announcement came before the Nets’ 108-99 loss against the Bulls to go 2-6 on the season, with Jacque Vaughn appointed as interim head coach.\n\nSteve Nash was appointed as the Nets head coach in 2020 Dustin Satloff/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nMarks denied that Nash’s firing had anything to do with the Kyrie Irving situation.\n\n“No. No. We try to separate the two things,” he said.\n\n“It’s a good question, and it’s easy to sort of lump it all in, but I think for where we’re at, we’re trying to separate the basketball side and what’s best for the team moving on.”\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported that Brooklyn may hire suspended Boston Celtics coach Ime Udoka, but Marks said that the team has yet to choose the next coach.\n\n“I really don’t think it’s up to me right now to give a list of candidates who we’re talking to and where we’re going to arise and we’re going to fall on this, but I would say I will reserve that for when those decisions are made,” he added.\n\n“I couldn’t give you a timeline of that,” continued Marks. “There’s a reason why we made this move when we did because time is ticking.

Following a broken kneecap in the 2015 NBA Finals, Irving returned to the court in December and played his best basketball of the season during the playoffs, helping Cleveland win the 2016 championship with stellar play and a game-winning three-pointer with 53 seconds left in Game 7 against Golden State.\n\nDuring the playoffs, Irving averaged 25.2 points, 4.7 assists, 1.7 steals and shot 47.5% from the field and 44% on three-pointers. In the Finals, he averaged 27.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.1 steals, proving he could perform on that stage when it was questioned whether he could.\n\n“In high school, I thought he would be great. He’s better,” U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “The thing about him is he’s still getting better and he’s smart — smart people-wise and smart game-wise. He’s smart while the game is going on at a high level. The really good ones are like that.”\n\nNow, Irving has a chance to become one of a few players to win an NBA title and Olympic gold in the same year.\n\n“Other than it being Coach K’s (U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski) last go-around at the Olympics, having an opportunity to win an NBA championship and a gold medal and playing with all these amazing guys and going for something bigger than myself and understanding it takes a process to win something big, I wanted it again,” Irving said. “I was yearning for it. It’s a special opportunity.”\n\nAt 24, Irving has emerged as a double-threat: elite guard and sought-after endorser for multiple products.\n\nIrving the pitchman continues to expand from his popular Uncle Drew Pepsi commercials and is a natural in front of the camera whether caked in old-man makeup or as himself. He has exclusive deals with headphone-maker Skullcandy and trading-card company Panini.\n\nHis Kyrie line with Nike is one of the company’s fastest-growing signature shoes. It’s a part of the business he enjoys even as he eschews “CEO of his own brand” as a cliché.\n\n“I love it because I’m allowed to be myself, and I’m allowed to connect with people beyond branding,” Irving said. “I don’t do it for the money. I don’t do it for anything else other than making genuine connections and putting things out in the world that I can truly be proud of because it came from me.”\n\nHis on-court performance bolsters his off-court success. After breaking a kneecap, no one knew what kind of player Irving would be when he returned.\n\nPrivate and generally unwilling to reveal too much of his rehab, Irving told USA TODAY Sports during the NBA playoffs that he “wasn’t going to settle for just being OK and not being everything I thought I could be.”\n\n\"This is what my dad (Drederick) prepared me for,” Irving said. “He prepared me for going through the ups and downs of life and dealing with things that happen, and it’s just part of life. How you respond and how you come out of it is the true definition of your character.”\n\nWhen asked last week about Paul George’s devastating leg injury during U.S. training for the 2014, Irving said, “Sometimes, adversity can do that to you, and it has a way of shaping a person’s life like no other. … None of us were there when he was just alone and thinking about life and how he was going to get back. None of us were there when he was trying to figure out ‘where’s the next step?’\n\n“Those days when you’re knocked down and by yourself are the days the define you, define the way your life is going to be shaped.”\n\nIrving could have been talking about himself. And both George and Irving will be integral players as the U.S. men’s team tries to win a third consecutive gold medal.\n\nWhile some All-Stars decided not to play in Rio, Irving planned on playing as long as he was healthy. He and Krzyzewski have talked about Rio since 2012 when Irving was a member of the U.S. select team that scrimmaged against the London Olympic team.\n\nBecause of an injury in 2010, Irving played just 11 games in one season for Krzyzewski at Duke, the two maintain a close relationship. Irving played for Krzyzewski at the 2014 World Cup in Spain and was named MVP of the event following his championship performance in which he scored 26 points and made 6-for-6 three-pointers against Serbia.\n\n“It’s turned into a mentorship, which I’ve enjoyed,” Irving said. “It’s been so beneficial to my development as a man and as a player. He’s checking in on me at least once or twice a month during the season and when I get a chance to go back to Duke or see him during the season, he’s family. From the first time he walked in my house and started cooking with my stepmother, it’s been nothing but family.”\n\nBy the time the Rio Olympics are over, Irving will have played more games for Krzyzewski with the U.S. than he did for Duke.\n\n“He loved being at Duke. He comes back. We follow him. We know his family, so he’s never left our family,” Krzyzewski said. “For me to have had the opportunity to coach him in Spain and win was great for both of us. We won a championship together. Hopefully, we can win another one.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/28"}]}

CNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince early in the pandemic, China has used health codes on mobile phones to track individuals’ health statuses. The color of these codes – in red, amber or green – decides whether users can leave their homes, use public transport and enter public places, or potentially need to quarantine.\n\nUnder the guidelines released Wednesday, people will be able to enter most places without showing a negative test result or their health code – a significant step after nearly three years of disruption to people’s daily routines and livelihoods.\n\nOnly a few exceptions will still require these checks, including nursing homes, medical institutions and secondary schools. Businesses can now determine their own prevention and control policies, the report added.\n\nHome quarantine allowed\n\nIn another massive change, asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms will be allowed to quarantine at home instead of being taken to a government facility, unless they choose otherwise.\n\nPatients whose condition deteriorates will be transferred to hospital for treatment, the report said. Close contacts can also quarantine at home.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Chinese residents have described the chaos and stress of going into quarantine camps, many saying it was unclear when they would be allowed to leave, and others complaining of crowded or poor conditions.\n\nIn several cases, health workers reportedly killed the pets of those taken to government quarantine, citing health risks – triggering outrage on Chinese social media each time. Others criticized the policy after reports earlier this year of elderly residents being forced out of their homes in the middle of the night for transport to quarantine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Man dragged out of home after allegedly refusing to go to quarantine facility 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nLimits on lockdown\n\nThe new guidelines also urge authorities to “ensure the normal functioning of society and basic medical services,” saying areas that aren’t designated high-risk should not restrict people’s movements or close businesses.\n\nLockdowns are only allowed in “high-risk areas,” and even then, should be “promptly” lifted if no new cases are found for five consecutive days, it said. It added that authorities are forbidden from blocking fire escapes, apartment or building entrances, and other gates, so residents can still evacuate and seek medical attention if needed.\n\nThis particular guideline comes at a particularly sensitive time, with China still reeling from a wave of rare public protest in late November and early December, that had been triggered by a deadly fire in the far western Xinjiang region. Public fury had swept the nation after videos of the incident appeared to show lockdown measures had delayed firefighters from reaching the victims.\n\nDuring the protests, thousands across the country took to the streets to call for an end to lockdowns and other zero-Covid measures – with some voicing broader grievances against censorship and the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian leadership.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': Protester tells CNN what the atmosphere is like in China 03:57 - Source: CNN\n\nVaccination plan\n\nThe State Council on Wednesday also emphasized the need to accelerate Covid vaccination among the elderly, saying all locations should be “administrating as many vaccinations as possible.”\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, experts say even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion.\n\nMore than 86% of China’s population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission. That leaves around 25 million who have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and November 28 vaccination data. But booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated, but only 40% had received booster shots as of November 11, according to state media.\n\nDomestic travel\n\nThe rules also make domestic travel within China easier, with cross-regional travelers no longer needing to provide a negative test result or their health code – or test upon arrival.\n\nThese former requirements, as well as other travel restrictions such as provincial border closures and provincial train and bus suspensions, have made domestic travel difficult over the last few years.\n\nFor the many in China who left their hometowns to find work in other cities and provinces, that meant being separated from family for long stretches – or being stranded far from home without an income during snap lockdowns.\n\nResidents line up for Covid tests in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China on December 1. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nIn recent days, some social media users have pointed out that Lunar New Year is just a month away – the country’s biggest annual holiday, a time when people typically travel home to gather with family, akin to the American Thanksgiving.\n\nFor some, the prospect of mass nationwide travel has raised concern of the virus spreading once more. Others, long fatigued with the toll of zero-Covid, greeted the news with relief.\n\n“I haven’t been home for Chinese New Year for two years now, I’m crying,” one person said on Weibo. Another wrote: “It’s been a long time. Welcome home.”\n\nMedicine, schools, and monitoring\n\nA few other guidelines are also likely to ease the transition away from zero-Covid toward a less disruptive model.\n\nFor instance, schools without Covid outbreaks are now asked to carry out “normal offline teaching activities,” and to reopen on-campus facilities such as cafeterias, libraries and sports venues. Schools with Covid cases can continue “normal teaching and living,” as long as they designate certain “risk areas” with control measures.\n\nThe guidelines also emphasize the need to make medicine widely accessible, dropping restrictions that previously made it difficult to buy cold and fever medication in pharmacies. Since early in the pandemic, China has required a prescription and negative Covid test to buy these.\n\nPerhaps reflecting public concern that the relaxation in rules could cause a surge in cases, residents have rushed to drug stores, with reports last week that cold and fever medicines were flying off shelves.\n\nThe State Council also urged doctors and local medical institutions to continue closely monitoring the health situation of key populations, including the risks posed to elderly or immunocompromised residents.\n\nSome experts have warned that a broader reopening inevitably brings health risks, especially to those vulnerable groups.\n\n“The key risk when countries decide to move away from a zero-Covid policy is really the strain this will exert on the health care system,” said Ruklanthi de Alwis, deputy director for the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/us/five-things-december-7-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Dec. 7: Senate, Trump Organization, Gas prices ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Raphael Warnock will win Georgia’s Senate runoff, CNN projects, delivering another rebuke of former President Donald Trump’s influence after the defeat of his hand-picked candidate Herschel Walker. The win for Warnock allows Democrats to secure a slim 51-49 majority over Republicans in the Senate and will give the party significant governing advantages compared to the current 50-50 split in the chamber. For example, Democrats will hold majorities in each committee, allowing them to process legislation and nominations much faster. They will also have stronger power to issue subpoenas and would have an easier time filling a Supreme Court vacancy. On Tuesday, after several news networks projected Warnock would win, Walker conceded and urged his supporters to keep believing in America.\n\n2. Trump Organization\n\nTwo Trump Organization companies were found guilty Tuesday on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. A Manhattan jury specifically found the Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. guilty on all charges they faced connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives. Former President Donald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but Trump was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors referencing his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives – including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses. The Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines. Attorneys representing the organization said they plan to appeal.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why Trump wasn't charged in Trump Organization's felony scheme 03:34 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Gas prices\n\nA sharp drop in oil prices this week is a good sign that prices at the pump will continue decreasing, analysts say. Oil prices have tumbled to their lowest level of the year – despite worries about the health of the economy and amid concerns about new restrictions imposed on Russian energy. On Monday, the European Union banned certain oil imports from Russia while the West placed a $60 cap on Russian oil. Both moves are designed to hurt Russia’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine without hurting consumers abroad. In the US, the national average price for regular gasoline currently stands at $3.35 a gallon, according to AAA. Gas prices have dropped 14 cents in the past week and 42 cents in a month.\n\n4. Apple\n\nApple has been sued by two women who allege their previous romantic partners used the company’s AirTag devices to track their whereabouts, potentially putting their safety at risk. AirTags are Bluetooth locators that users attach to items – such as keys, wallets or laptops – that enable their location to be found on a map. While the devices can be a helpful tool to prevent losing personal items, some experts have warned that they could be used to track people without their consent. In this new lawsuit against Apple, one of the women said her ex-boyfriend allegedly placed a disguised AirTag into the wheel well of a tire on her car. The other woman said her ex-husband, who had been harassing her and challenging her about her whereabouts, placed an AirTag in her child’s backpack, the lawsuit said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how Apple's $450M emergency SOS service works 02:27 - Source: CNN Business\n\n5.

Ma Mingyan/China News Service/VCG/getty Images\n\n“The world changed overnight, and that’s really amazing,” said Echo Ding, 30, a manager at a tech company in Beijing. “I feel like we are getting back to normal life. This is important to me because if I don’t get back to a normal life, I might lose my mind.”\n\nBut Ding, like many across the country, also expressed unease with the rapid change. Even after much of the world relaxed pandemic restrictions, China continued to lock down entire cities and send all Covid-19 patients to central quarantine facilities, while restricting others merely for visiting an area where a positive case was detected.\n\nOn Wednesday, China’s health authorities overhauled the zero-Covid policy with a 10-point national plan that kept some restrictions, but largely scrapped health code tracking for most public places, rolled back mass testing, allowed many positive cases to quarantine at home and imposed limits on lockdowns of areas deemed “high risk.”\n\n“How can it change so fast?” Ding asked. “It gives me the feeling that we are like fools. It’s all up to them. They said it’s good, so then it’s good … that’s what I feel right now. It is so unreal, but I have no choice. All I can do is follow the arrangement.”\n\nDavid Wang, 33, a freelancer in Shanghai, said although the changes were welcome, they had also sparked a feeling of disbelief in the city, which underwent a chaotic, more than two-month-long, citywide lockdown earlier this year.\n\n“Of course I was very happy about these new changes – (but) most of my friends are showing typical signs of PTSD, they just can’t believe it’s happening,” he said.\n\nCaution and concern\n\nTop health officials in Beijing on Wednesday said the changes to the rules were based on scientific evidence, including the spread of the comparatively milder Omicron variant, the vaccination rate, and China’s level of experience in responding to the virus.\n\nBut the changes, which come on the heels of a wave of unprecendented protests across the country against harsh Covid restrictions, are a swift about-face for a government long bent on stamping out all infections. While health authorities made slight policy revisions and cautioned officials against overreach last month, the central government up until last week had shown no signs of preparing for an imminent shift in its national strategy.\n\nThe government and state media had long emphasized the dangers of the virus and its potential long-term effects – and used this to justify the maintenance of restrictive policies.\n\nNow, a flood of articles highlighting the more mild nature of Omicron and downplaying its risks have created a feeling of whiplash for some, and fall well short of the kind of public messaging campaigns that some other countries carried out before their own pandemic policy changes.\n\nThat’s left many unprepared for what experts say could be an impending surge in cases in a country where the vast majority of people have not been exposed to the virus.\n\nOn China’s heavily moderated social media platform Weibo, topics and hashtags related to what to do if infected by Omicron trended high on Thursday morning, while there were numerous reports of panic buying of fever medications.\n\nOnline retailer JD.com said in a statement Thursday that sales of drugs including cold and cough medicine, fever reducers, and anti-inflammatories on its health platform were 18 times greater over the previous seven days than the same period in October, while the search volume for Lianhua Qingwen pills – traditional Chinese medicine touted by the government as a treatment for Covid-19 – had surged 2,000 times year-on-year.\n\nSales of face masks increased 682% year-on-year in the first six days of the month and antigen test sales were up 462% compared to the previous week, the company said, adding it was taking steps to ensure stable supplies and prices.\n\n“People were not told what kind of medicine they should have and what they should do if infected until there was widespread infection. In fact, we should have started doing this a long, long time ago,” said Sam Wang, 26, a lawyer in Beijing, who added that the policy release felt “sudden and arbitrary.”\n\nOthers expressed concerns about living with the virus. Aurora Hao, 27, an English teacher in Beijing said: “I want to keep myself safe, because I could be fine after my first infection, but if I am reinfected a second or third time, I’m not sure what harm that will bring to my body.”\n\nFears about the impact of Covid-19 within China may also play out along generational and geographic lines, as younger people and those in more cosmopolitan urban centers may be more likely to support reopening the country and relaxing rules, residents said.\n\nWang in Shanghai said the larger conversation in China was polarized. Among his own friends, those in the metropolis had been hoping for a relaxation of rules, while others in smaller cities were more trusting of the government’s long-term narrative about the dangers of coronavirus infection.\n\nMeanwhile, his mother was now buying high-grade N95 masks and preparing for a “nuclear winter” until a potential initial wave of cases passed, Wang said.\n\nWait and see\n\nWhile the changes were greeted with relief by many and sparked discussion online of freer travel within the country – and perhaps even international travel in the future – there was also a sense of uncertainty about what lay ahead.\n\nAlready there has been some contradiction in how the guidelines are implemented as local authorities adjust – and many are watching to see the impact in their cities.\n\nIn Beijing, authorities on Wednesday said a health code showing a negative Covid-19 test would still be required for dining in at restaurants or entering some entertainment venues – in conflict with the national guidelines.\n\nHao, in Beijing, said on Wednesday evening that her health code had turned yellow – which would usually bar her from entering most public places, until she queued up for another test that returned a negative result. Now, with the new rules she knew she could largely go out freely, but instead she stayed at home to “wait and see.”\n\n“We are still waiting and watching. It is not the case that people all rushed out once the seal is off,” she said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Cheng Cheng", "Simone Mccarthy", "Cheng Cheng"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/08/15/school-mask-mandates-spark-protests-parents-covid-cases-rise/8124375002/", "title": "School mask mandate protests stir chaos amid delta variant COVID ...", "text": "A New York school board meeting was canceled.

A 12-year-old Florida student found her voice advocating for masks to protect her younger brother. In a protest earlier this month, a North Carolina school board was \"overthrown.\"\n\nEmotions ran high on both sides as school boards across the country debated mask mandates, generating stunning video footage that bombarded social media. Some parents showed up to pressure local officials to require masks in defiance of state laws, while others used debunked science to argue masks should not be required.\n\n\"The parents need to be the boss of what's best for their children,\" Anna Penola, a parent of four, told the Michigan State Board of Education, which decided to support local districts' choices on masking.\n\n\"This is a matter of life and death,\" countered Mike Siegel, a parent of two elementary students in Austin, Texas, and a former Democratic congressional candidate, who urged his county to require masks.\n\nAs the delta variant of the coronavirus has run rampant throughout much of the country, more children are becoming infected and ending up in hospitals. More than 90% of COVID-19 cases affecting children now are caused by the delta variant.\n\nExperts don’t know whether the variant is causing worse symptoms in children than earlier strains of the virus, but they do know it’s more contagious. Kids under 12 are still ineligible for a vaccine.\n\nThe Backstory:More kids are getting COVID just as school resumes.\n\nShould kids wear masks in school? These states have banned mandates despite experts’ pleas\n\nThey also know that wearing a mask is instantaneous protection from infection, even in environments where only partial masking is taking place.\n\nIn Florida, 12-year-old Lila Hartley of Jacksonville made headlines when she stood up to her school board and asked for a masking requirement. She’s vaccinated, but her 10-year-old brother Will is ineligible for a shot.\n\n\"I am so worried that if masks are not required, my brother could go to school one day and the next, be dying in the hospital,\" Lila wrote on a wide-ruled notepad. \"We are siblings so we have our rivalries, but I don't know what I would do if he died, especially if it was caused by a place that means so much to him, school.\"\n\nShould kids wear masks in school?:These states have banned mandates despite experts’ pleas\n\nHer plea came after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order prohibiting masking mandates in schools and threatened the salaries of local school officials who defied the order. Several counties, including Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Orange and Palm Beach, have announced mask mandates in defiance of the governor.\n\nLila’s parents have supported her as she attended a rally outside her district headquarters and plans to lobby her principal to provide more outdoor seating at school.\n\nMost schools in the Petal School District in Mississippi are implementing temporary mask mandates after a Change.org petition started by parents urged administrators to comply with CDC and state health officials’ recommendation for masking in schools.\n\nBut plenty of parents across the country are up in arms against measures to limit the spread of the virus like masking and vaccine requirements in schools. Many are fueled by misinformation or the simple desire to see their children in a normal school setting.\n\nAn all-day, sometimes fiery meeting of the Michigan State Board of Education saw commenters spread misinformation about vaccines and masks, with some parents even threatening to remove their children from the public school system. It ended with the board not taking a firm stance at all.\n\nElsewhere, a Tennessee school board meeting descended into threats and insults as a mob of anti-mask parents formed, angry at local health care providers who recommended a mask mandate for a district just south of Nashville.\n\nA video shows a masked man who spoke in favor of the mask mandate leaving the public meeting and a crowd of angry people surrounding and berating him as he walked to his car.\n\nIn Colorado, more than 200 parents, children and community members attended an anti-mask rally outside a meeting for a school board that instituted a mask mandate. They were countered by a half-dozen teachers and others in the community who supported the mandate.\n\nAhead of a Brevard County School Board meeting in Florida where the board voted to leave masks optional, pro-mask and anti-mask groups clashed, exchanging shouts and insults.\n\nDespite the controversy, some facts are clear.\n\nChildren are contracting COVID-19, and at higher rates than before. There were 93,824 child COVID-19 cases nationwide reported July 29 through Aug. 5, or 15% of the total weekly reported cases, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. \"After declining in early summer, child cases have steadily increased since the beginning of July,\" the academy reports.\n\nAnd, children want to be able to stay in school.

Wearing their judicial robe and exhausted from the final push of work, the justices take their seats and the majority opinion is read by its author.\n\nThe hand-down can take several minutes as the audience of spouses, staff, spectators and journalists digest what’s being read aloud. Often times, the justice who penned the principal dissent, also chooses to address the audience, offering a fiery oral critique of the majority opinion.\n\nNone of that is expected to happen this month.\n\nInstead, the courtroom’s majestic chamber is dark – ostensibly due to lingering Covid concerns. The plaza has been completely walled off by security fences, a move prompted by protests that erupted last month after a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked to the media. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging a California man with attempting to murder Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nNow, armed guards are providing 24-hour protection at the justices’ homes while protestors sometimes gather outside and the President has signed legislation to enhance security protection for the justices and their families.\n\nWith no pomp and circumstance, an official will push a button and opinions changing the contours of some of the most divisive social issues of the day including abortion, gun rights, religious liberty and the environment – will simply be released via the internet.\n\nBy then, with no reason to appear publicly, many of the justices may have already fled Washington.\n\nJustices announced five new opinions Tuesday morning, including a much-anticipated ruling on the separation of church and state. The next opinion day is Thursday, with 13 cases remaining.\n\nHere are the highlights of the court’s docket:\n\nAbortion\n\nIt was Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest serving justice on the current court, who likely assigned fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito to write the draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that could overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe dispute concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The state is asking the justices to take the giant step of overturning Roe, a seminal case decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAt oral arguments, Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart told the justices that Roe and a follow up decision from 1992 “haunt” the country.\n\nAt one time Mississippi’s law was dismissed as blatantly unconstitutional, even by a conservative-leaning appellate court. But much has changed since then, including the fact that in December the justices allowed a six-week ban on abortions in Texas to remain in effect. Since then, red states, invigorated by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, have passed increasingly restrictive laws. Last month, for example, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that bans abortions from the stage of “fertilization” and allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman obtain the procedure.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Roberts may be working on an alternative opinion, analyst says 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the draft opinion, Alito said that Roe “must be overruled.” If the five-member majority holds, it will wipe away near 50-year-old precedent and change the landscape of women’s reproductive health going forward.\n\nSupporters of abortion rights are clinging to the fact that Alito’s opinion was a draft and hope it only reflects an opening salvo written after the justices cast initial votes at conference.\n\nVotes can change during deliberations. Sometimes majority opinions fizzle into concurrences or even dissents. Other justices could be simultaneously working on separate opinions, hoping to pick off votes from Alito’s draft or to weaken the thrust of his opinion.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nAs the country grapples with gun violence, the justices will decide how broadly they want to rule in a case that could open up a new chapter in constitutional challenges to gun safety laws.\n\nAfter oral arguments last year, it seemed the conservatives were ready to strike down a New York law – enacted more than a century ago – that places restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon outside the home. Supporters of gun rights have been pushing the court to clarify the scope of the Second Amendment for years. The effort has been led by Thomas, who in the past called the Second Amendment a “disfavored right in this court.”\n\nBut the entire landscape of the debate has shifted in recent months. Since the justices began deliberating, mass shootings have occurred across the country including a Texas massacre of 19 schoolchildren in Texas. While the shootings did not directly implicate the issue of concealed carry, the country as a whole is now debating gun safety laws.\n\nReligious liberty\n\nOn top of abortion and gun rights, the court is also considering cases that could allow more religion in public life.\n\nTuesday, the court said that Maine cannot exclude religious schools from a tuition assistance program that allows parents to use vouchers to send their children to public or private schools.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling is the latest move by the conservative court to expand religious liberty rights and bring more religion into public life, a trend bolstered by the addition of three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nThe justices are also grappling with the case of Joe Kennedy, a former Washington state high school football coach at a public school who lost his job for praying at the 50-yard line after games.\n\nKennedy told CNN that “every American should be able to have faith in public and not be worried about being fired over it.”\n\n“I think it is important to keep our promises – especially to God,” he said.\n\nBut the school district said it suspended Kennedy to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a particular faith, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe liberal justices on the court – Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – made clear at oral arguments that they were worried about players feeling coerced by the school to pray.\n\n“I’m going to just sort of suggest,” Kagan said, “the idea of why the school can discipline him is that it puts some kind of undue pressure, a kind of coercion, on students to participate in religious activities when they may not wish to, when their religion is different or when they have no religion.”\n\nImmigration\n\nAs the political branches spar over immigration, the justices are considering several cases concerning border disputes.\n\nIn one key case, the justices are grappling with whether the Biden administration can terminate a Trump-era border policy known as “Remain in Mexico.” Lower courts have so far blocked Biden from ending the policy.\n\nUnder the unprecedented program launched in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security can send certain-non Mexican citizens who entered the United States back to Mexico – instead of detaining them or releasing them into the United States – while their immigration proceedings played out. Critics call the policy inhumane and say it exposes asylum seekers with credible claims to dangerous and squalid conditions. The case raises questions not only regarding immigration law, but also a president’s control over policy and his diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Toobin: SCOTUS says this is history, we're dealing in the present 02:56 - Source: CNN\n\nClimate change\n\nThe justices unexpectedly also agreed to decide a case concerning the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, in a dispute that could cripple the Biden administration’s attempts to slash emissions.

A lower court wiped away a Trump era rule in 2021 and the Biden administration’s EPA is currently working on a new rule.\n\nBut the fact that there were enough votes to take up the issue now, struck some as an aggressive grant, signaling the court wants to limit the scope of the EPA’s authority even before a new rule is on the books.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/china-covid-flight-bans-quarantine-updates-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China scraps Covid-19 flight bans, cuts quarantine for inbound ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina has reduced the amount of time travelers entering the country must spend in quarantine and removed a major restriction on international flights, in a sign of a limited easing of its stringent zero-Covid policy.\n\nThe new measures were announced Friday following a meeting by the ruling Communist Party’s top decision-making body, during which leaders vowed to maintain Covid protocols while stressing the need to minimize economic and social disruptions.\n\nThe long-awaited announcement, however, does not explicitly mention when the changes will take effect.\n\nChina is the last major economy to adhere to a zero-Covid policy, using snap lockdowns, mass testing, extensive contact-tracing and quarantines to stamp out infections as soon as they emerge.\n\nThe zero-tolerance approach has faced increasing challenges from highly transmissible new variants, and its heavy economic and social costs have drawn mounting public backlash.\n\nThe easing of the measures will see authorities scrap the so-called “circuit breaker” mechanism, under which China-bound flights were suspended if an airline was found to carry a certain number of passengers who tested positive for Covid upon landing.\n\nInbound international passengers will also see their pre-departure test requirement reduced from two to one, and their mandatory centralized quarantine upon arrival cut from seven days to five days, followed by another three days of home isolation.\n\nInternational travelers who do not have a permanent address in China will still need to do a total of eight days of quarantine in hotels.\n\nMarkets responded positively to the changes as Covid-19 restrictions have kept international investors jittery.

China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, when asked about the fallout from Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to Taipei.\n\n“As for what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see,” Zhao added.\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, meeting with Malaysian politicians on August 2.

President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.\n\n“The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July.\n\nWhile Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources.\n\nAdministration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials.

Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nPelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.\n\n“I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.”\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n“On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.”\n\n“We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.”\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n“It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.”\n\n“It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.”\n\nWhen asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Monday.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung Kylie Atwood Alex Rogers Kevin Liptak", "Eric Cheung", "Kylie Atwood", "Alex Rogers", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "What protests in China may mean for the economy | CNN Business", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

The demonstrations against Chinese President Xi Jinping and his costly zero-Covid policy are an exceedingly rare case of widespread civil disobedience.\n\nWhile the protests represent an unprecedented challenge for Xi, they also carry economic and market implications. Oil plunged and hit 2022 lows on Monday, while shares of companies that rely on China for production felt the heat. Apple fell by 2.6% following reports that unrest at one of its factories could result in 6 million fewer iPhone Pros this year.\n\nWhat’s happening: China’s controversial zero-Covid policy has affected everyday life and weighed heavily on the economy. When outbreaks get bad enough, entire cities are closed: Shanghai was shut down for about two months this spring and Chengdu, a city of 21 million people, was locked down in the fall.\n\nEarlier this month, Beijing eased some Covid-related restrictions, sparking hopes that the economy could soon fully reopen, but local governments once again tightened controls as cases surged. The policy doesn’t seem to be working, as cases hit record highs, but China’s low vaccination rate, relatively ineffective vaccines and aging population mean the alternative could be very deadly.\n\nThe mounting political tension has also been difficult to interpret. The protests at first seemed focused on Covid restrictions, but now appear to carry broader demands for political reform: The blank sheets of paper held up by demonstrators in Shanghai, the country’s financial hub, have already become iconic symbols of defiance against a government that limits free speech.\n\nEconomic impact: People under lockdowns say they struggle to find food and other necessities. Economic growth has slumped and unemployment has been been rising as a consequence of the lockdowns.\n\nThe policy has also led to major global production constraints that are sustaining inflation. Global supply chain pressures increased moderately in October after five consecutive months of easing, largely due to increases in Asian delivery times, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index.\n\nHowever, commodities slid on China concerns Monday. Oil prices dropped sharply, with investors concerned that surging Covid cases and protests in China may sap demand from one of the world’s largest oil consumers.\n\nWhat’s next: Chinese government officials are in a strange spot. They don’t want to end their covid policy but they also want to ensure that the political unrest doesn’t grow. Companies that do business in China are watching closely for any clues about what the future may hold. They’re also considering moving production away from the country in the long term — Apple has already shifted some of its manufacturing to India.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in a research report published late on Sunday, predicted that protests could lead China to scrap its zero-Covid policy earlier than previously expected, with “some chance of a forced and disorderly exit.”\n\nBut the next few days could be pivotal. If protests flare up again, the Chinese government will likely be forced to react in some way. On Tuesday, it announced an “action plan” to boost vaccination rates among the elderly. But “with a rapid spread of new COVID cases, it’s hard to envision a broad lifting of restrictions that would boost the country’s economic outlook for next year significantly,” said Christopher Smart, chief global strategist at Baring. “In any case, the continuing uncertainty of pandemic policy will lead to further pressures on global supply chains and keep prices higher than they would otherwise be.”\n\nBig data week\n\nUS investors took a short break from the trading floor last week as they celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday. Now, the vacation is definitely over. This week is chock full of important economic data releases, many of which will help guide the Fed’s next interest rate hike decision in December.\n\nHere’s what to keep an eye out for.\n\nTuesday brings a housing bonanza: At 9 a.m. ET the September House Price Index (HPI), a measure of the change in single-family house prices, is due out. The September S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index, which measures the change in the selling price of single-family homes in 20 metropolitan areas across the United States, is also due out.\n\nAlso on Tuesday: The Conference Board’s November measure for the level of consumer confidence in economic activity. That’s a leading indicator as it can predict consumer spending.\n\nWednesday is a big Fed day: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will discuss the economy and labor market at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution at 1:30 p.m. ET. A question and answer session with the audience is also expected. Traders will closely watch his speech for hints about future monetary policy.\n\nFed Governor Lisa Cook will also discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy at an event hosted by the Detroit Economic Club, and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman will discuss the future of small banks, with a question and answer session afterward.\n\nMore data: Wednesday also brings some employment data. First up is The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of the monthly change in private employment, based on the payroll data of approximately 400,000 US business clients. Next comes October JOLTS, a survey by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure job vacancies.\n\nRevised numbers for third-quarter GDP and PCE inflation are also expected out and October Pending Home Sales which measures the change in the number of homes under contract to be sold.\n\nThursday is all about inflation: October’s Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET. The index measures changes in the price of goods and services purchased for consumption. Core PCE, which excludes gas and food, is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.\n\nFriday is jobs day: Here comes government unemployment numbers for November. Given that full employment is one of the Federal Reserve’s mandates, it is very closely watched.\n\nChicken is on the menu this holiday season\n\nExpect heavier holiday promotions this season, say Bank of America analysts. Why? Retailers are dealing with an excess of inventory they’re trying to get rid of, but it also comes down to timing.\n\nLast year, Americans did their holiday shopping earlier in the year because they were worried about shortages and because the Omicron Covid wave kept people out of stores ahead of the holidays. This year things are expected “to mimic a normal pre-pandemic holiday,” wrote the analysts, with the exception of one thing: There’s an additional day between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year because Christmas Eve falls on a Saturday.\n\n“We think this will likely result in a frenzied game of chicken, with shoppers waiting until the very last minute for great deals and retailers balancing selling at the highest price with moving through enough product,” said Lorraine Hutchinson, a research analyst at Bank of America.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/04/politics/americans-divided-july-fourth-democracy/index.html", "title": "July Fourth: Americans divided over what US stands for on the 246th ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRarely have Americans been so divided on what their country stands for as on the 246th anniversary of independence.\n\nAs red, white and blue fireworks burst in air on Monday night, politics may not be at the forefront of most people’s minds.\n\nYet a fractious partisan age is undeniably penetrating everyone’s lives.\n\nIf, as Abraham Lincoln said, a house divided against itself cannot stand, the years to come beckon even more national discombobulation. The unity for which President Joe Biden pleaded in his inaugural address seems more elusive than ever.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cheney says January 6 committee could issue criminal referral for Trump 02:20 - Source: CNN\n\nUS democracy is still fighting for its survival, as the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol reveals ever more frightening details of Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 election. The ex-President is, meanwhile, impatient to launch a 2024 campaign rooted in his election fraud lies that would highlight his increasingly autocratic tendencies.\n\nIn another example of startling political disruption, an activist Supreme Court, protected behind high metal fences in its marbled Washington chambers, just stripped away the constitutional right of millions of women to have an abortion. The decision validates a half-century campaign by conservative activists, many of whom have sincere moral objections against abortion, which they equate with the murder of an unborn child.\n\nBut the Supreme Court’s decision and the emerging patchwork system of abortion restrictions across the US have been met with outrage in other parts of America. On Sunday, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential Republican presidential candidate, defended her state’s abortion ban on CNN’s “State of the Union” when asked whether a 10-year-old girl who was raped should be forced to give birth, or to explain how her state will care for women deprived of the right to end a pregnancy. Her evasions encapsulated how many supporters of abortion rights see hypocrisy and inhumanity among some of those who profess to care for life – and the irreconcilable divide on this issue in the country.\n\nGiven the political discord boiling way beneath the surface of Monday’s national celebrations, it’s hardly surprising that a staggering 85% of US adults in an Associated Press-NORC poll released last week said things in the country are headed in the wrong direction. The survey formalized what is obvious: for all its advantages, abundant resources, comparative prosperity and history of working to perfect its democracy, the United States is not a country at ease with itself right now. The cliché that America’s best days are ahead is becoming harder to believe.\n\nMore reasons for gloom\n\nSocial tensions are being exacerbated by economic pressure.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is making food bills more expensive and spiked gasoline to record prices. Biden’s struggling presidency appears out of ideas as to how to help after potentially worsening the situation by pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of spending into the economy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden: 'The reason gas prices are up is because of Russia' 01:29 - Source: CNN\n\nGun crime in cities is recalling a more violent past and every Monday brings a grim accounting of the weekend’s mass shootings. In the latest tragic outburst of violence, at least six people were killed and two dozen were injured at a shooting at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park on Monday. The exact circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear Monday afternoon as authorities launched a search for the perpetrator.\n\nThe sense of a country politically on edge is being exacerbated by the shadow of Trump’s violent coup attempt.\n\nA flurry of restrictions on voting in many conservative-led states and the GOP’s refusal to renew voting rights legislation harken back to a poisoned era of racial repression. Liberals who once dreamed of a new Franklin Roosevelt are dissatisfied with the results of their narrow monopoly on political power in Biden’s Washington. But their radicalism also risks alienating the crucial middle ground of voters who ought to be up for grabs as the GOP dives right.\n\nIncredibly, the country is struggling to make enough infant formula to feed its babies – and is having to fly in emergency supplies from abroad – a metaphor if there ever was one for a time when things just don’t seem to be going very well.\n\nAnd in some regions, the spectacles that bring Americans of all persuasions side by side – the July Fourth fireworks shows – are being dampened by bans imposed because the land is tinderbox dry because of global warming, another threat that defies a political consensus for action.\n\nA deeply divided nation\n\nAlmost every day, there’s a controversy or political fight that underscores the antagonism between more moderate, diverse and socially tolerant American cities and suburbs and the conservatism of rural America.\n\nMany leaders on both sides of the aisle accentuate differences for political gain, only adding to the sense of anger coursing through the country. Elected leaders who seek to bring those with divergent views together are an endangered species.\n\nIncreasingly, for those who think about politics, each side of the divide sees the other as an existentialist threat to their idea of America – a schism of perception especially demonstrated in recent weeks by the fight between supporters and opponents of abortion rights.\n\nOn the right, disillusionment with government itself – which fueled Trump’s rise and is being exacerbated by his election fraud lies – is a driving force in a Republican Party that is giving up on democracy.\n\nOn the left, more and more people see a Supreme Court that is openly flouting majority opinion as illegitimate. The high court was once seen as above the partisan flames. But even its justices have been caught up in a tide of fury, with sniping more characteristic of social media than Supreme Court opinions. During oral arguments before last month’s landmark overturning of Roe v. Wade, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered whether the court could “survive the stench” of stripping away abortion rights. In his majority opinion that did just that, Justice Samuel Alito relished dismissing the reasoning behind Roe as “egregiously wrong.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Justice Samuel Alito? 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Supreme Court was once seen as a moderating force for stability. But in its new zeal for ripping up precedents, the conservative majority has turned it into yet another destabilizing force in society.\n\nReasons for hope\n\nSo what grounds are there for hope this Independence Day? Biden is insisting that things are not as bad as they seem, seeking to fulfill that part of a president’s duties that involve bucking the country up.\n\n“You haven’t found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards,” the President insisted as he wrapped up a visit to Europe last week.\n\n“America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world,” he said, while being somewhat economical with the truth when it comes to the spike in inflation that he once dismissed.\n\nBiden, of course, has an interest in painting things in a better light than they are, especially with midterm elections approaching in which Democrats are likely to suffer from his sub-40% approval rating.\n\nBut it’s not all darkness. Biden has piloted the United States out of the depths of the pandemic recession. Prices might be high and consuming wage gains, but unemployment is around 50-year lows. This could cushion the impact of a recession many experts fear is on the way.\n\nHindsight showed that Biden’s declaration of partial independence from Covid-19 last July Fourth was premature – and politically unwise. But life is far closer to normal than it was a year ago and the United States is better prepared to handle any resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall. There are plenty of vaccinations to go around, though again, politics appears to be threatening the common good with refusal to take such precautions a badge of honor among some grassroots conservatives.\n\nWashington may not be as irredeemably broken as it seems. Since last year, Republicans and Democrats have combined to pass a huge new law fixing the country’s aging infrastructure – a task that evaded recent presidents before Biden. And after a deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Senate passed one of the most sweeping firearms safety laws in a generation. The measure might have fallen far short of the pleas of grief-stricken family members of the mass shooting victims in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But it was a sign that even in this vicious political climate, incremental change fashioned through political institutions is not impossible.\n\nFor the first time in two decades, Americans are not fighting major wars abroad. And Biden’s leadership of the West in standing up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may represent the most significant show of American global leadership since the Cold War.\n\nThe bravery of those who stood up to Trump’s attempt to steal power in 2020 is also an inspiration this July Fourth. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House January 6 committee, may alienate liberals with her political views, but she’s written herself a place in history by standing up for democracy, unlike many of her genuflecting GOP rivals who run perpetually scared from Trump.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former Trump White House aide, put far more senior colleagues to shame by showing how one person can take a stand for truth with her televised testimony before the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection.\n\nAnd if the majority of the country that didn’t want to see Roe reversed wants an example of turning demoralizing defeat into eventual victory, they can look to the years of activism by the anti-abortion movement to see how political change can be forged by generations of campaigners who stay committed to the goal.\n\nBecause this July Fourth, America still does have a democratic political system that can be shaped by the people.\n\nAt least, it does for now.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/17/us/florida-math-textbooks-critical-race-theory/index.html", "title": "Florida rejects several math textbooks from schools citing critical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Florida Department of Education announced Friday the state has rejected more than 50 math textbooks from next school year’s curriculum, citing references to critical race theory among reasons for the rejections.\n\nIn a news release, the department stated 54 out of 132 of the textbook submissions would not be added to the state’s adopted list because they did not adhere to Florida’s new standards or contained prohibited topics.\n\nThe release said the list of rejected books makes up approximately 41% of submissions, which is the most in Florida’s history.\n\nReasons for rejecting textbooks included references to critical race theory, “inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics,” the release states.\n\nA list of the textbooks obtained by CNN shows that eight different publishers had submissions rejected for referencing critical race theory, social-emotional learning and other special topics.

It’s not been proven to be effective, and quite frankly, it takes our eye off the ball,” the governor told reporters at a news conference.\n\nAndrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association, called for transparency on how the state’s department of education made the decision, including examples of “objectionable” content and details about those who reviewed the textbooks and their qualifications.\n\n“As it stands now, only one publisher’s full suite of K-5 math textbooks is available to Florida districts, and we don’t have a detailed understanding of why,” Spar tweeted. “The state has an obligation to ensure that every child is getting the math instruction they need with the highest quality materials.”\n\nDeSantis said state officials “got rid” of Common Core, a standardized teaching method rolled out in 2010. The method requires children to group numbers to solve arithmetic problems, rather than the vertical “carry the one” method familiar to most adults. The approach goes beyond simple computation to emphasize deeper mathematical concepts.\n\nThe department said some of the rejected textbooks incorporated Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and references to critical race theory – two frameworks or philosophies that some conservative groups claim are being used to indoctrinate students.\n\nSome schools around the country have recently used SEL strategies to help students cope with stress and the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning defines SEL as a teaching framework aimed at helping “young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions.”\n\nMore than a dozen states have set standards for teaching SEL in grade schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But as more states consider SEL strategies, conservative groups have claimed critical race theory is embedded into the framework.\n\nCritical race theory has become widely politicized in recent years. Opponents argue the area of study is based on Marxism and is a threat to the American way of life. But scholars who study it say it explores the ways in which a history of inequality and racism in the United States has continued to impact American society today.\n\n“Critical race theory is a practice. It’s an approach to grappling with a history of White supremacy that rejects the belief that what’s in the past is in the past, and that the laws and systems that grow from that past are detached from it,” said Kimberlé Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor who teaches at UCLA and Columbia University.\n\nEducators in multiple states have argued critical race theory is generally not included in grade school teaching.\n\nAt least a dozen laws aimed at restricting how topics like racism, sexism, and American history are being taught in American schools have passed in several states and more than 100 bills have been proposed since last year, according to the free expression group PEN America.\n\nJeremy Young, senior manager of the Free Expression and Education program at PEN America, said the textbook rejections in Florida raise questions on whether decisions are being made based on teaching or politics.\n\n“The rejections come in the midst of a multipronged effort to undermine faith in public schooling, and invoke terms that have become buzzwords for justifying censorship, but which remain vague and ill-defined,” Young said. “Math textbooks’ merit should be evaluated in terms of how effectively they help students learn mathematical concepts.”\n\nIn Florida, lawmakers banned the teaching of critical race theory in schools in June 2021. At the time, DeSantis said allowing critical race theory in schools would teach children that “the country is rotten and that our institutions are illegitimate.”\n\nFlorida Department of Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, right, alongside Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaks at a news conference in March. Michael Snyder/The Northwest Florida Daily News/USA Today Network\n\nThe law states instruction in schools must be “factual and objective.” It specifically prohibits “theories that distort historical events” – including “the teaching of Critical Race Theory, meaning the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons.”\n\nFlorida also banned teaching material from the 1619 Project, the New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize-winning project to reframe American history around the date of August 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on America’s shores.\n\nThe highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an “alarming” 71% were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics, the release said.\n\nDespite rejecting 41% of materials submitted, every core mathematics course and grade is covered with at least one textbook, the release said.\n\nIn a statement, DeSantis said he is grateful for the department’s thorough vetting of these textbooks to ensure they comply with the law.\n\n“It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” the governor said.", "authors": ["Tina Burnside Zoe Sottile Nicole Chavez", "Tina Burnside", "Zoe Sottile", "Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/17"}]}

Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nAn executive at The Times, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, acknowledged to CNN on Wednesday that the work stoppage would certainly create difficulties. But, the executive said, management has readied for the moment and could rely on the newspaper’s other resources, such as its international staff which largely are not part of the union, to fill the voids.\n\nJoe Kahn, executive editor of The Times, said in a note to staff, “We will produce a robust report on Thursday. But it will be harder than usual.”\n\nKopit Levien added in her email to the company that The Times has “plans in place to ensure that we meet our obligation to our readers and the general public by reporting the news as fully as possible through any disruption caused by a strike.”\n\nBut some staffers at The Times went as far on Wednesday as to urge readers not to consume the outlet’s content during the walkout.\n\n“We’re asking readers to not engage in any [New York Times] platforms tomorrow and stand with us on the digital picket line!,” Amanda Hess, a critic-at-large for the newspaper, wrote on Twitter. “Read local news. Listen to public radio. Make something from a cookbook. Break your Wordle streak.”\n\nAt a rally held Thursday afternoon outside The Times’ offices in Times Square, dozens of union members held picket signs, handed out pamphlets, and demanded better wages.\n\nNew York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones speaks outside the Times' office, Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022, in New York. Hundreds of New York Times journalists and other staff protested outside the Times' office after walking off the job for 24 hours, frustrated by contract negotiations that have dragged on for months in the newspaper's biggest labor dispute in more than 40 years. Julia Nikhinson/AP\n\n“We make the paper, we make the profits!” the crowd chanted.\n\nThe strike comes as the Gray Lady and the NewsGuild of New York remain at odds over a number of issues, particularly wages, amid a backdrop of layoffs and cuts across the media industry.\n\nIn recent weeks, CNN laid off hundreds of staffers, newspaper chain Gannett cut 200 employees, NPR said it will need to find $10 million in savings, and other news organizations have explored the need to trim budgets and freeze hiring.\n\nThe Times has maintained that it offered the guild “significant increases,” but the union countered that the newspaper’s management has “frequently misrepresented its own proposals.”\n\nThe Union Times, a newsletter published by the NewsGuild, described The Times’ wage concessions on Wednesday as “paltry” and said management has “barely budged” on the issue.\n\nThe two parties have been bargaining since the last contract expired in March 2021. Last Friday, the NewsGuild informed The Times about its plans to stage a walkout, a move aimed at applying pressure to management to offer additional concessions in negotiations.\n\nThe union has asked The Times to meet in the middle on wage increases, but the newspaper believes the union started from an extreme position, making doing so a non-starter.\n\nBoth sides have worked throughout the week to avert the 24-hour strike. But it was to no avail.\n\nManagement at The Times had grown frustrated with how the NewsGuild has sought to conduct negotiations and partly blamed the lack of progress on it.\n\n“They refuse to meet in person,” the executive told CNN. “It’s a really important point. I can’t emphasize it enough. We have negotiations on Zoom. There are eight or so people from management, as many as 18 people on the bargaining committee from the NewsGuild, and as many as 200 union members watching as ‘observers.’”\n\n“Negotiations are essentially public,” the executive continued. “And that changes the whole dynamic of negotiations. It becomes very performative and very theatrical. It’s really hard to get things done. It’s like a show. And we need productive negotiations to get to a deal.”\n\nSusan DeCarava, president of the NewsGuild of New York, said in response, “Union democracy is crucial to union power. That is why we don’t do closed-door negotiations, which management continues to demand.”\n\n“All members who will be affected by the decision made at the bargaining table should be privy to those discussions,” the representative added. “When Times management comes to the bargaining table with their insulting and disrespectful offers, they have to explain it to a room full of their own employees—and they hate it. The result of management’s public actions is the powerful strike that is happening tomorrow.”", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/media/new-york-times-union-negotiations-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "The New York Times is bracing for a historic mass walkout as union ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe New York Times is preparing for more than 1,100 of its union staffers to go on strike for a full day Thursday — an act of protest that has not been staged by employees at the paper of record since the late 1970s.\n\nThe historic work stoppage is set to go in effect at midnight on December 8 and last for an entire 24 hours. Instead of filing stories, employees will be seen picketing outside The Times’ offices at 1pm, with prominent journalists such as Nikole Hannah-Jones set to speak during a solidarity rally.\n\nSome major desks at the paper could lose a staggering 90% of their workforce during the strike, according to the NewsGuild of New York, which represents journalists and other staffers at The Times.\n\nIn effect, the public will get a glimpse of a world without much of The Times’ hard-hitting and informative journalism.\n\n“We had hoped to reach a fair deal before our deadline, but more than 1,100 of us are ready to take a stand together, for each other and for journalists everywhere,” reporter Jenny Vrentas said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

The Times says it has offered the guild “significant increases,” but the union counters that the paper has “frequently misrepresented its own proposals.” The two parties have been bargaining since the last contract expired in March 2021. After a year-and-a-half, unionized workers have had enough and so, last Friday, the NewsGuild informed The Times about its plans to stage a walkout.\n\nBoth sides have been working to reach a deal and avert the 24-hour strike. Bargaining persisted into the evening on Tuesday, continuing beyond the planned 9am-5pm window. And it is possible an agreement will somehow be struck before the work stoppage goes into effect.\n\nBut it’s not looking great.\n\nA spokesperson for The NYT said “no decisions have been made” about bargaining on Wednesday. But NewsGuild spokesperson Wen Zhuang said there are no more planned sessions on the schedule, which would make it far more difficult to hammer out a last-minute agreement.\n\n“It’s very likely that the walk out will be happening,” Zhuang said.\n\nManagement at The NYT, while initially “blindsided” by the walkout threat, according to a source, has started preparing for the scenario. The NYT’s human resources chief, Jacqueline Welch, stressed to staffers Tuesday morning, in a memo that CNN obtained, that employees who participate in the work stoppage “will not be paid by the company for the duration of the strike.” Welch added that employees “cannot use vacation or personal days to account for this time” unless it was approved prior to last Friday.\n\nAnd as Vanity Fair’s Charlotte Klein reported Tuesday, management is also working to find content to fill the paper during the day of work stoppage. Klein reported that managers are exploring a range of options to keep the news flowing, including pulling from wires and asking reporters to file stories early, as if they were readying for a major holiday. And much of the paper’s international staff is also not in the guild, meaning they are expected to continue their reporting.\n\n“While we are disappointed that the NewsGuild is threatening to strike, we are prepared to ensure The Times continues to serve our readers without disruption,” a spokesperson for The NYT reiterated on Tuesday.\n\nBut, with a mostly empty newsroom, that might prove difficult.", "authors": ["Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/us/five-things-december-8-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Dec. 8: Marriage bill, Ukraine, Power grid ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Marriage bill\n\nThe House is expected to vote and pass legislation today that would protect same-sex and interracial marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act, which the Senate passed last week in a bipartisan vote, needs to be approved by the House before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. In a sign of how much support has grown in recent years for same-sex marriage, the bill found backing from 12 Republican senators last week, including those in deeply red states.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is “going to take a while,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday as he warned of the “increasing” threat of nuclear war. Putin said he viewed the Russian nuclear arsenal as a deterrent rather than a provocation – but has not dismissed the idea of using nuclear weapons outright. “We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are,” Putin said. “We have these means… but we are not going to brandish these weapons like a razor, running around the world.” His comments come as the Biden administration is weighing Ukrainian requests for access to the US stockpile of controversial cluster munitions. These types of scatter weapons are imprecise by design and are banned by more than 100 countries. Still, Russia is using them to devastating effect inside Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Mud, blood, trenches': Ukrainian soldier compares Bakhmut battle to World Wars 03:21 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Power grid attacks\n\nElectricity for thousands of residents in North Carolina has been restored after a dayslong outage caused by targeted gun attacks on power substations. Police say the motive behind the attacks in Moore County remains unknown and no suspects have been announced. However, investigators are zeroing in on two possible threads centered around extremist behavior: writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure, and a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ events across the nation by domestic extremists. Approximately 45,000 homes and businesses initially lost power when the outages occurred on Saturday, leaving residents without heat, running refrigerators or traffic lights for about four days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police find new evidence in North Carolina power grid attack 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration has appealed a federal court decision that blocked the use of Title 42 – a controversial Trump-era policy allowing for the swift removal of migrants at the US-Mexico border. The authority has been heavily criticized by public health experts and immigrant advocates, and has largely barred asylum at the US-Mexico border. While its origins were in the Trump administration, Title 42 has become a key tool for the Biden administration as it faces mass migration in the Western hemisphere. Officials have been bracing for an influx of migrants when the authority lifts on December 21. The Department of Homeland Security is projecting up to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border per day when the policy is lifted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visits US-Mexico border where migrants wait to cross into US 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations are on the rise in the US, with more than 34,000 new admissions last week – but millions of vaccine doses and antiviral treatments remain unused. The federal government has spent more than $30 billion so far on Covid-19 vaccines and the Biden administration has said it cannot afford to continue this level of spending unless Congress provides it with more funds. As a result, the administration has started to prepare for the transition of the vaccines to the commercial market. Pfizer and Moderna have already announced that the commercial prices of their Covid-19 vaccines will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose – or about three to four times what the federal government has paid.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHarry and Meghan Netflix documentary released today\n\nEveryone has been waiting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to spill the royal tea.

The Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs said in a statement the 23 deaths occurred at the Bill Nichols State Veterans Home in Alexander City, about 70 miles southeast of Birmingham in rural Tallapoosa County. The state-owned facility has a capacity of 150 residents, and 91 have tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said. A worker at the veterans home who tested positive for the virus March 30 wasn’t allowed to enter, the statement said, and the first resident tested positive nine days later. All residents were tested April 18, and the home still has 41 active cases among the residents. A National Guard unit decontaminated the home, and residents who test positive are being isolated.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A legislative committee set aside lingering legal questions and agreed to Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s plans for $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid. Many Legislative Budget and Audit Committee members said Monday that getting the money out was more important than haggling over legal authority for the spending, KTOO Public Media reports. The committee, made up of House and Senate members, previously agreed to Dunleavy’s plans for about $125 million, a fraction of his total request, while working through remaining items. Big-ticket items addressed Monday involved $586.6 million for communities, $290 million for small-business assistance and $100 million for fisheries. State law allows a governor to submit to the committee plans to accept and spend additional federal or other program funds on a budget item. It delays for 45 days use of the funds unless the committee earlier agrees.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey said Tuesday that he’ll let gyms and public swimming pools reopen and will allow his stay-at-home order to expire this Friday as he continues easing the painful restrictions he imposed on businesses and individuals to tamp down the coronavirus outbreak. Gyms and pools, among the last remaining facilities that have not been allowed to operate, were permitted to open their doors Wednesday if they follow recommendations from health officials. The governor also invited professional sports to resume without fans. He warned, however, that lifting the restrictions does not mean a return to a normal way of life from before the pandemic, and he said social distancing is still important. “This is not a green light to speed,” Ducey said. “This is a green light to proceed, and we’re going to proceed with caution.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state has ordered a large theater to abandon its plans to defy coronavirus restrictions on gatherings by holding what could be the nation’s first major concert this far into the pandemic. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday that the state Health Department was sending a cease-and-desist letter to the Fort Smith venue, TempleLive, to postpone or cancel a concert Friday night by country rock singer Travis McCready. The event, expected to draw more than 200 people, would be held three days before Arkansas allows large indoor entertainment venues to reopen. “You can’t just arbitrarily decide when the restrictions are lifted. That is something that is done based upon a public health requirement,” Hutchinson told reporters. The state is allowing theaters, arenas and other entertainment venues to open Monday, but with audience limits. TempleLive did not immediately respond to messages Tuesday afternoon.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County reopened its beaches Wednesday in the latest cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions that have closed most of the state’s public spaces and businesses for nearly two months. County beaches and many city-owned beaches along the 75 miles of coastline are open only for “active recreation,” such as walking, swimming and surfing. Sunbathing, picnicking and group sports such as volleyball are still banned, and strangers must stay well apart. Visitors also must wear masks when they’re out of the water. Some mayors warned that the state or county could close the beaches again if people disobey the restrictions and crowd the shoreline. “Please, hit the beach, do your thing, and leave. No hanging out for this first phase,” Redondo Beach Mayor Bill Brand urged in a Facebook post.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: The Weld County jail violated inmates’ constitutional rights in the way it handled the coronavirus, a judge ruled. Judge Philip Brimmer found Monday that Sheriff Steve Reams failed to take adequate measures to protect inmates and that they are entitled to a limited preliminary injunction so the jail can “ameliorate those conditions,” the Greeley Tribune reports. The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a lawsuit on behalf of several inmates who considered themselves to be in the high-risk category for COVID-19. The coronavirus first reached inside the jail in mid-March, court officials said. Reams has not instituted any specific precautions to protect medically vulnerable inmates, Brimmer concluded. He ordered Reams to take several steps, including instituting new policies inside the jail to curtail the spread of the coronavirus and compiling a list of medically vulnerable inmates currently held at the jail.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont made an example of himself Tuesday, getting screened for the coronavirus as the state looks to significantly increase testing before it begins the planned reopening of the economy May 20. The governor, who did not immediately receive his test results, said the state has increased testing from about 18,000 per week two weeks ago to about 29,000 per week. He expects more than 42,000 tests will be conducted next week, giving the state a much better idea of how the virus has spread in the community. “I am out there encouraging people to get tested right now,” Lamont said. “I don’t want to see this hesitancy. I don’t want to hear people say, ‘Not for me; I’m worried about the possibility of a quarantine. I don’t want to hear what is going on.’ ” He said the state is moving to quickly test all residents and workers at nursing homes and significantly ramp up testing in prisons and among first responders.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state plans to hire about 200 workers to help trace the contacts of those who test positive for the coronavirus, state officials announced. Delaware was set to partner with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago to build the new statewide contact tracing program, Gov. John Carney said in a statement Tuesday. “This contact tracing program brings us one step closer to returning Delaware to a new normal,” he said. Those who test positive for the virus would receive a call from a case investigator who would ask the patient for a list of their known contacts, according to the plan. Tracers would then then reach out to those contacts to help them quarantine and arrange resources, as well as get tested for the virus in some cases. The National Opinion Research Center also partnered with Maryland, and the two states agreed to share information to monitor the virus’s spread across state lines, officials said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has extended D.C.’s stay-at-home order for an additional three weeks until June 8, WUSA-TV reports. Originally, the order was set to expire May 15. Nonessential businesses are to remain closed until June 8, and mass gatherings are still banned in D.C. Bowser said infections have not declined enough to start officially reopening the capital, although new cases in the district have declined over the past four days. In order for the first phase of reopening to start, two weeks of that decline is expected. DC’s doubling time – the time it takes for total cases to double – has also slowed to more than a month for the first time. It’s a sign of the spread of infection slowing. “Our message remains the same: Stay home,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: After being shuttered for almost two months, Universal Orlando plans to allow the reopening of some restaurants and shops on a limited basis in the theme park resort’s entertainment district this week, company officials said Tuesday. About a half-dozen restaurants and eateries, as well as two retail shops and some merchandise carts, will reopen at Universal Orlando Citywalk on Thursday in a sign of the baby steps the city’s theme parks are taking to get back to business after they closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Next week, Walt Disney World will allow some third-party shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs entertainment district to reopen. Workers and guests will be required to wear face masks. Per state rules, indoor capacity will be limited to 25%, and dining tables outside must be more than 6 feet apart. Neither Disney World nor Universal officials have said when theme parks and hotels will reopen.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians may be spending a lot of time at home, but it’s not stopping them from playing the state lottery. Lottery sales set a monthly record in April after dropping in March, said Brad Bohannon, the Georgia Lottery Corp.’s vice president for government relations. “While most other forms of entertainment were limited, April sales rebounded extremely well,” Bohannon told the state House Higher Education Committee on Tuesday. That’s continuing in May, with Bohannon saying two of the five highest sales weeks in lottery history have come this month. He credited much of the increase to a 50% jump in use of the lottery’s online options, which allow people to buy tickets and play dozens of online gambling games at home. Proceeds from the lottery finance college aid called Hope Scholarships and preschool classes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Health on Tuesday asked lawmakers to appropriate about $2.5 million to fund a program at the University of Hawaii that would train workers to track contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19. State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said the department hopes this training will begin in the next month. She said the goal was to have the program train a total of 200 workers in two phases. With the help of a cellphone app that people can use to report their health condition to contact tracers and the more traditional method of making phone calls, each worker would be capable of tracking about 20 people per day. Altogether they would be able to track 4,000 people. Graduates of the program would join the Medical Reserve Corps and be available to augment staff contact tracers as the need arises.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Authorities have approved a plan to prevent giant rangeland wildfires in southwestern Idaho by clearing vegetation along 435 miles of roads to create fuel breaks. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the work for the Idaho portion of the Tri-state Fuel Breaks Project that also includes breaks in southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada. The area contains sagebrush steppe that is key habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife on land also used by cattle ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts. The Idaho fuel breaks protect 2,500 square miles by creating 200-foot buffers on each side of roads. That adds up to about 32 square miles of cleared vegetation in Idaho. The two-phase plan is to put in fuel breaks on more heavily traveled Idaho routes and follow that up with breaks on interior routes, giving the area a jigsaw puzzle appearance. In theory, one piece of the puzzle might burn, but the fuel breaks would aid firefighters in preventing an adjacent piece from catching fire.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state reported a one-day record high in COVID-19 cases Tuesday and its next-to-highest death toll, just a day after Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced that the peak in coronavirus infections originally projected for late April has been pushed into mid-June. The governor noted that the 4,014 new cases reported – nearly 900 more than the previous high May 1 – should come as no surprise given that the state received test results on more than 29,000 people in 24 hours, which is thousands more than in previous days. Testing availability, which continues to grow in Illinois, is key to tracking the disease and resuming a sidelined economy. The Democrat called on lawmakers – who have been kept from the Capitol by coronavirus restrictions since early March – to act “expeditiously” to put together a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and compile aid packages for those struggling financially. The Illinois House will convene for three days next week.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s gas and electric companies are asking regulators to allow them to recover lost revenue from customers due to the pandemic, but critics argue that it would burden struggling consumers even more. Ten companies, including Indianapolis Power & Light Co. and Duke Energy Inc., filed the request Friday with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. They want to charge customers for all “bad debt expense incurred” associated with an executive order that has suspended disconnections for nonpayment through June 4. Building closures across the state have caused an overall downturn in energy use, thus putting a financial strain on energy companies, the petitioners said. Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, a consumer group, called the request “unprecedented utility greed.” Essentially, utilities want to charge customers for energy that they did not sell, said Kerwin Olson, the group’s executive director.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Restaurants, salons, barbershops and gyms will be allowed to reopen Friday under new restrictions intended to slow the coronavirus, the governor announced. Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday that she would lift an order closing restaurants in 22 counties, including the state’s largest metropolitan areas. Reynolds said she would also allow fitness centers, salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and massage therapists to reopen in all 99 counties. The move came as deaths from the virus in Iowa surged for the second straight day, surpassing 300 since the beginning of the pandemic. It also came as Reynolds and the state’s medical director self-isolated after potentially being exposed to the virus at the White House last week. Reynolds said she felt confident reopening more of Iowa’s economy because the state has enough hospital beds and ventilators to treat patients, and its testing capacity has increased.\n\nKansas\n\nHolton: A meatpacking plant has shut down after five employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The shutdown at the Johnsonville plant in Holton took effect Wednesday, WIBW reports. “It’s a tough decision to halt production, but we appreciate Johnsonville for doing this to help us stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Angie Reith, Jackson County Health Officer. Johnsonville said all employees will continue to get paid, and downtime will be used to implement even more aggressive safety protocols before reopening. Some new safety protocols include placing additional barriers between workstations where social distancing is not possible. Meanwhile, counties in southwest Kansas with plants continue to deal with outbreaks among employees. Ford, Seward and Finney counties together had more than 2,700 cases as of Monday, or 38% of the state’s total. They had the highest rates of cases per 1,000 residents in the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Derby Museum announced it will donate more than $10,000 of its proceeds from online merchandise sales to coronavirus relief efforts in the state. The donations will go toward Gov. Andy Beshear’s Team Kentucky Fund and the One Louisville COVID-19 Response Fund, the museum said Tuesday in a Facebook post. After the 146th Kentucky Derby was postponed from May 2 to Labor Day weekend, the museum pledged last month to donate 20% of online sales from collectible merchandise with the original race date of May 2 to funds that help people who have been financially affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “Customers realized it was a great opportunity to purchase collectible Derby 146 merchandise while supporting a great cause,” Patrick Armstrong, president and CEO of the museum, said in a statement. The museum’s gift shop will reopen May 20 under state health guidelines, museum officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dining in restaurants can resume in the city beginning Saturday – with reservations. Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Tuesday announced a loosening of restrictions on businesses adopted to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. Restaurants, which have been limited to take-out orders in New Orleans, will be able to provide outside table service, as well as dine-in service at 25% capacity. But diners will have to make reservations. Walk-in diners will be allowed to enter, but they will have to provide a name and number for an on-the-spot reservation. The information will have to be kept by the restaurant for 21 days to aid in contact tracing if needed. “We know keeping the data will matter,” Cantrell said. Zoos, museums and aquariums will also be limited to 25% capacity and will have to stagger admission by using a reservation system. Retailers can open if they have exterior entrances and maintain social distancing.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Health and Human Services is promoting affordable insurance options for residents who’ve lost health care coverage during the pandemic. Maine residents who’ve lost a job may also have lost their employer-provided health insurance. Many may qualify for a free or low-cost plan through MaineCare or the federal marketplace, the DHHS said. A state website, CoverME.gov, provides a resource for health insurance options. Eligible Maine people may enroll in MaineCare at any time of year. Maine DHHS is also collaborating with the Maine Department of Labor to inform those applying for unemployment insurance that they may be eligible for affordable health insurance options.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Residents used words like “soul-crushing” and “hell” to describe their experiences seeking unemployment benefits via a state website, testifying Tuesday during an online hearing with state lawmakers. More than 1,100 people signed up to testify before leaders of two Maryland Senate committees, which scheduled hours to hear from the first 270 who signed up to testify. A common complaint was the inability to reach someone for help using the website. “You can call thousands and thousands of times and be unable to get through,” said Beth Bell, who was laid off in mid-March. “If you do get through to one of them, you’ll end up in a circle and then get disconnected. It’s soul-crushing.” Others spoke of spending hours over several weeks trying to get through to someone for help. Bliss Martin said someone finally got back to her to help Monday, after she started sending emails about two weeks ago.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterans home that’s been the site of one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the nation will undergo a management overhaul, and going forward it will operate with fewer residents and new safety protocols, according to state officials. About $2 million in improvements are also being made to the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke to make it safer, Daniel Tsai, deputy secretary of the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said Tuesday at a meeting of the home’s trustees. “We have been in quite a bit of a gauntlet, but we are not in the clear,” Tsai told Masslive.com. As of Tuesday, 74 residents of the long-term care facility for elderly and ill veterans who have recently died tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to state officials. Another 87 residents have tested positive. Several state and federal investigations into the deaths are underway.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Officials said Wednesday that 31,000, or nearly two-thirds, of state employees will take temporary layoff days through late July as the state confronts a budget shortfall amid the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the state will participate in a federal “work-share” program, allowing employees to work fewer hours but collect partial unemployment benefits to make up a portion of their lost wages. The furloughs – two layoff days per two-week pay period for non-managers – will start this Sunday and go through July 25. Higher-level managers will not be part of the work-share program but will take one layoff day every other pay period – a 5% pay cut. The move will save the state up to $80 million. The layoffs will not affect state troopers, prison guards and others working on the front lines.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has signed six bills into law as the regular session of the Legislature winds down toward its adjournment date Monday. One of the bills he signed Tuesday extended a state COVID-19 relief fund that expired this week. Another allows the state to tap $17 million in federal election security funds. A third requires prescription drug manufacturers to make information public for large price increases. The elections bill includes preparations for increased absentee voting, switching some polling places to safer locations, and public outreach for implementing social distancing guidelines related to voting. But it doesn’t include a wholesale switch to mail-in voting for the August primary and November general elections, as Walz and other Democrats had sought. Republicans blocked that idea. Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann told the Star Tribune the governor is still looking at other options to make it easier to vote by mail, given that a second wave of COVID-19 could hit during the fall election season.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he is tightening regulations in parts of the state seeing the fastest spread of the new coronavirus. The target area is seven largely rural counties in the east-central part of the state: Attala, Leake, Scott, Jasper, Neshoba, Newton and Lauderdale. While Reeves previously suggested people wear masks in public, his new executive order makes that mandatory in some situations in the seven counties. In addition, businesses are required to screen employees for COVID-19 symptoms at the start of each shift, to provide hand sanitizer and to ensure employees remain at least 6 feet apart wherever possible. Reeves announced the new restrictions even as he has spent the past several days lifting some statewide limits by allowing the reopening of restaurants, barbershops, hair salons and gyms; those establishments must limit customers and take other precautions.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus in the state both reached somber milestones Tuesday: Cases topped 10,000, and the number of deaths exceeded 500. The state health department reported 88 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 10,006. Thirty-six new deaths were reported. Since March, 524 people in Missouri have died from the virus. St. Louis continues to be the hardest-hit region. State data shows that 53.4% of confirmed cases and 70.4% of deaths have occurred in St. Louis city and county combined. Nearly three dozen inmates at an eastern Missouri jail have tested positive for the coronavirus, along with five members of the jail staff. And the Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston has reported 43 prisoners and 14 staff have tested positive for the virus.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Actor Jeff Bridges is starring in a COVID-19 public service campaign urging Montanans to remain vigilant against the coronavirus threat as the state eases restrictions, the Montana Hospital Association said Tuesday. The association launched “Stay the Course, Montana,” in which Bridges, a part-time Montana resident, encourages residents to keep up social distancing and to wear a face cloth covering whenever in public. It is sponsored in part by the Murdock Charitable Trust. Bridges makes a brief reference to his character “The Dude” from the 1998 film “The Big Lebowski” when he says, “We can abide with this thing, man. We’ll get through this.” The commercials will be seen on TV, radio and digital media and will direct people to a new website, StaytheCourseMontana.com, which has tips on staying healthy, what to do if you’re sick, information about testing, how the public can help through donations and volunteer efforts, and more.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Nebraska State Fair officials are still planning to hold the 11-day event in Grand Island later this summer, according to a release from the fair’s interim director. Interim director Jaime Parr said the event starting Aug. 28 and running through Sept. 7 is still on, as is its Aksarben Stock Show set to rup from Sept. 24-27. “State Fair staff and Board are mindful of and monitoring the current COVID-19 impact to events and social gatherings,” Parr said. But plans to hold the fair could still change if the outbreak worsens, she said. Parr said that officials are assessing options should they become necessary and that staff recently met to begin looking at contingency scenarios.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The casino workers’ Culinary Union held a protest drive up the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday evening to call for casino companies to release their reopening plans and to adopt the union’s recommended safety protocols. The union has called for casinos to publicly release the detailed plans they are submitting to gambling regulators laying out how they plan to safely reopen when Nevada allows it. Gov. Steve Sisolak shuttered the properties in mid-March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The governor said he’s allowing the Nevada Gaming Control Board to have the final say on when casinos can reopen. The union wants more extensive proposals, including testing staff for COVID-19 and screening people, including guests, with temperature checks upon entry. And the group has called for the regulators or elected officials to release all other casino plans and to include the union’s proposed rules as part of any reopening plan.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A panel tasked with reopening the state’s economy amid the easing threat from the coronavirus pandemic agreed Tuesday on proposals for seven sectors, among them lodging, outdoor attractions and gyms. The recommendations won’t be final until public health officials and Gov. Chris Sununu give their OK. The task force unanimously recommended that hotels be limited to half their capacity, though the limit would not apply to motels with outdoor access to rooms or to inns and bed-and-breakfasts with 10 or fewer rooms. Face masks would be required for staffers and are recommended for guests, who would be asked at check-in about any possible exposure to the coronavirus. A reopening date of May 22 is recommended for lodging, but target dates for other sectors were not included.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nonessential businesses, shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak, will open next week for curbside pickup, as will nonessential construction, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. Curbside pickup at businesses – like retail stores – and nonessential construction can start at 6 a.m. Monday under an executive order Murphy said he will sign. The state’s COVID-19 trends are headed in the right direction, he said, leading him to relax the nearly two-month-old business shutdown. Over the past two weeks, newly hospitalized people are down 28%, patients in hospitals are down 34%, and people in intensive care and on ventilators are down about 30%. Still, the state has higher hospitalization rates, positive cases and deaths per 100,000 people than any other state right now, Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is giving the green light for nonessential businesses including retailers and many services to reopen Saturday at limited capacity, while ordering that face masks be worn in public with few exceptions to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a news videoconference Wednesday that a new public health order will allow businesses to reopen at 25% of building occupancy limits. Large retailers can attend to 20% of maximum capacity set under fire safety regulations. New Mexico health officials cautioned that infections among children are surging, complicating efforts to reopen the economy and provide summer recreation programs. Lujan Grisham referred to children as potential “super-spreaders” of COVID-19. Strict limits on nonessential business will remain in place in northwestern New Mexico, which includes a portion of the vast Navajo Nation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A fourth region of upstate New York has met the criteria to gradually restart its economic activity as the state prepares to slowly relax its pandemic-induced social restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The North Country, a sprawling, rural swath that includes the Adirondack Mountains, met all seven benchmarks the state requires before selected businesses can be approved for reopening, according to the administration. New York’s Southern Tier, the Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes previously met the standards, and regions are preparing to reopen in phases as early as Friday. New York’s 10 regions can start reopening once they demonstrate that COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations are down; that there are enough hospital beds to meet any new surge in cases; and that there is sufficient local testing and contact-tracing efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Hundreds of state prisoners with COVID-19 are now deemed to have recovered based on government health guidelines. The state Department of Public Safety calculated that more than 500 of the over 640 offenders testing positive for the new coronavirus meet criteria to be released from medical isolation. Most of the prisoners presumed recovered are housed at the Neuse Correctional Institution, which underwent prisonwide testing four weeks ago. There have been 467 positive tests among inmates at Neuse. Five prisoners statewide have died from COVID-19-related illness. “We are not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot,” Commissioner of Prisons Todd Ishee said in a news release this week, pointing to efforts to clean prisons, isolate the sick and limit prisoner movement. “We must remain vigilant.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s most populous county has recorded a daily high number of positive tests for the coronavirus, state health officials said Wednesday. Testing from Tuesday showed 69 cases in of COVID-19 in Cass County, which includes Fargo. The county reported two deaths, both women in their 90s with with underlying health conditions. Cass County reported 60 positive cases in the two previous days combined. There were a total of 76 cases reported statewide from Tuesday, the highest number since a mass testing event last month for LM Wind Power employees and others in Grand Forks. It increased the total number of positive tests in North Dakota to 1,647. The state tested about 1,100 people Tuesday, for a daily positive test rate of about 7%. That compares to 6.5% from Monday, when more than 2,100 people were tested. There have been 40 deaths in North Dakota; 37 people are currently hospitalized.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: After weeks of waiting, self-employed workers can apply for unemployment approved by the federal stimulus package. Ohio Department of Job and Family Services started accepting applications from self-employed workers, 1099 tax filers and part-time workers Tuesday. The first payments will go out this weekend, Director Kimberly Hall said Wednesday. About 210,000 Ohioans who preregistered for benefits received an email Tuesday informing them that they could apply for benefits. As of Wednesday morning, 84,000 people had submitted claims, and 15,000 had been approved for payment, Hall said. All benefits are retroactive to the date a person lost their job because of the novel coronavirus, as far back as Feb. 2. The additional $600 per week is available from March 29 through July 25.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Collections to the state’s main government operating fund missed projections by 44% last month, the biggest shortfall in modern history, state finance officials said Tuesday. Postponing the income tax deadline from April to July, plummeting energy prices and the coronavirus-related shutdown of businesses across the state amounted to a “threefold economic gut punch,” said Office of Management and Enterprise Services Director Steve Harpe. “Missing this month’s estimate is not a surprise, but the magnitude is notable,” he said. Overall collections to the state’s general fund in April totaled $529 million, which is 44% below the monthly estimate. Total collections to the fund through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year were about 8.5% below the estimate, Harpe reported. April is historically the month with the largest revenue collections.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland Parks and Recreation will not open seasonal public swimming pools this summer and is canceling all camps and activities because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Tuesday. Parks, trails and nature areas remain open, and park greeters will be there “to make sure people know how to use their park system safely during the pandemic,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. But other programs on which families rely – including outdoor camps, Summer Free For All and the Portland World Soccer Tournament – are canceled. Portland Parks and Recreation Director Adena Long said in a statement Tuesday that the department will focus its efforts this summer on urgent community needs, including the Lunch + Play program, which provides free lunch to Portland kids all summer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Beaver County is among the counties planning to defy Gov. Tom Wolf, advising residents that it will operate under the looser coronavirus restrictions being allowed elsewhere in the state, an official said Wednesday. Beaver County, home to a severe outbreak in a large nursing home, is the only western Pennsylvania county where the Democratic governor has not lifted his tightest restrictions on residents leaving their homes and businesses that can operate. Wolf tapped 13 counties in the region, including the Pittsburgh area, to see relief from his tightest pandemic restrictions starting Friday, joining 24 other counties across northern Pennsylvania that began emerging last week. Dissatisfied, a growing number of Republican-controlled counties have vowed in recent days to join them, leading Wolf to threaten to block them from receiving pandemic aid.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has canceled all its study abroad programs for the upcoming fall semester in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the school announced Wednesday. “Given the uncertain nature of the global health crisis’s continued effects on both public health and on travel between countries, Brown has made the difficult decision to cancel all university-sponsored undergraduate study abroad for fall 2020,” the Ivy League university’s Office of International Programs posted on the school website. The office said it remains optimistic about its ability to offer study abroad programs in the spring 2021 semester, but the final decision has not been made. The Providence-based school is working on a plan to bring students back to campus this fall and expects to announce a decision by July 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate rebuked Gov. Henry McMaster for part of his coronavirus response, saying he should have gotten permission from lawmakers to continue the state of emergency for the pandemic over two months. The resolution rapping McMaster’s knuckles Tuesday was the last order of business on what appeared to be the last day of a regular session during which lawmakers had only met two days in the past two months. Every Democrat in the chamber sided with the Republican governor, and McMaster signed another 15-day state-of-emergency order Tuesday as the Senate met. None of the senators directly criticized McMaster’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. They did reject a proposal to call for the governor to immediately end any restrictions on businesses because of the coronavirus and not issue any more stay-at-home orders or rules closing businesses.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday held off her threat to sue Native American tribes that have set up highway checkpoints intended to keep the coronavirus away from their reservations, saying instead that she would like to work out an agreement. The Republican governor gave two tribes – the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe – 48 hours from Friday afternoon to remove checkpoints from state and federal highways or face a lawsuit. She said her office has been getting complaints that the checkpoints have caused a headache for people trying to enter the reservations for ranching or store deliveries. But the tribes kept the checkpoints, citing the threat of the virus, combined with their vulnerable populations and poor medical facilities, as urgent reasons to control access. Noem described the conflict as a “sticky situation” among federal, state and tribal authorities.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Fear of contracting the coronavirus doesn’t meet medical criteria for voting by mail, state officials said Tuesday. The determination comes as the state recommends preparations as though all 1.4 million registered voters 60 and older will cast mail-in ballots in the August primary within its pandemic election contingency plan. The document was prepared by the state Division of Elections, dated April 23, and obtained by the Associated Press. “In consultation with the Attorney General’s office the fear of getting ill does not fall under the definition of ill,” Elections Coordinator Mark Goins told the AP in a statement Tuesday about the viral outbreak. Republican Gov. Bill Lee swiftly backed the interpretation of the state elections coordinator, telling reporters that “what we want to do in this state is remove a reason to have fear about going to the polling booths.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state will begin widespread coronavirus testing in prisons where at least 30 people have died, officials announced Tuesday, and Houston will furlough about 3,000 workers as the economic shutdown and unsteady oil prices wallop the nation’s fourth-largest city. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also said he tested negative for the virus after his visit last week to the White House came on the same day that a valet to President Donald Trump tested positive. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced that tens of thousands of COVID-19 tests are on the way to the state’s prisons, where inmates have tested positive at a dramatically higher rate than the rest of Texas. The tests are designed to be self-administered, and a dozen “strike teams” are receiving training this week, agency spokesman Jeremy Desel said. More than 1,700 prison inmates have tested positive, according to the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Zion National Park reopened its gates Wednesday after an extended closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a set of restrictions in place to encourage social distancing. Limited operations were scheduled at the park, with the gates only open during daylight hours and the usual visitor shuttle system still closed. Multiple trail closures remained in effect, including popular attractions like The Narrows and the top section of Angels Landing. The park was closed for more than a month after Utah implemented restrictions limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer people. Tourism-reliant businesses in the gateway town of Springdale struggled with the steep drop in visitors. A reported 75% of Springdale hotel room reservations being canceled in April and May, according to a presentation from the county’s tourism office earlier this month.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is now offering free testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 to anyone who wants one, even people without symptoms, the Vermont Health Department announced. No referral from a health care provider is needed, although people are asked to make appointments in advance, the state said in a news release issued late Tuesday. State officials are scheduling a series of pop-up clinics where people can be tested as part of a broader effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Vermont officials say the state has one of the lowest rates of growth in people infected with the virus, and few people are showing symptoms, which means they are not requesting tests. Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine has said the state has ample testing supplies, and there is not a lot of demand for testing.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a call Tuesday from several top GOP lawmakers to institute a moratorium on the release of certain inmates by the Virginia Parole Board, which has come under criticism for some recent decisions. The request from the lawmakers, including the House and Senate minority leaders, came a day after state officials disclosed that Virginia’s government watchdog is conducting an administrative investigation into the board’s decision to grant parole to a man who has served decades of a life sentence for the killing of an on-duty Richmond police officer. Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement that the governor “rejects” the Republicans’ proposal. “The Governor and his administration have worked tirelessly to create a fairer and more equitable criminal justice system, and safe parole is an important part of that work,” she wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More than 1,300 people in the state have been trained and are ready to work with local health departments to do contact tracing once a case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in a county. At a news conference Tuesday, Gov. Jay Inslee said that of those already trained, 351 are from the National Guard, 390 are from the Department of Licensing, and 630 are state or local health professionals. He said that number could be expanded even more in the coming weeks. Inslee said that while the social distancing efforts that have been in place since March have been frustrating, they have been “significantly effective.” “Now as we attempt to transition to open back up our economy, we are simultaneously moving to this second initiative of testing, contact tracing and isolation,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday widened the most aggressive phase of his coronavirus reopening strategy to allow tanning salons to open just before Memorial Day weekend. The Republican governor said he has been overwhelmed with requests from tanning businesses to be included among the restaurants, big-box stores and recreational services reopening next week. “I never dreamed in all my life that we’ve gotten all these calls in regard to the tanning businesses or tanning beds. We continue to get all kinds of calls,” he said, adding that health officials now think it’s safe for people to tan. Justice has picked May 21, the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend, to stage the biggest step in his reopening plan, while warning that a second wave of the virus could cause catastrophic damage to the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The owner of a Christian-based children’s hair salon has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order that closed nonessential businesses is a violation of free speech and religious rights. The lawsuit filed Tuesday is the third legal challenge to the order issued by the Democratic governor that runs until May 26. Two other lawsuits are pending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. One was brought by Republican lawmakers alleging that Evers’ health secretary exceeded her authority in issuing the order. The other was brought by two men who argue Evers’ policies interfere with their free speech and religious rights. The third lawsuit was filed by Jessica Netzel, the owner of Kingdom Kuts in Appleton. Netzel asked U.S. District Judge William Griesbach to lift the order and allow her hair salon to be treated like businesses that Evers has deemed essential.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Access to the southern half of Yellowstone National Park will resume Monday by way of Wyoming, but park officials continue to talk with Montana officials about reopening the rest of the park after a seven-week closure due to the coronavirus, Superintendent Cam Sholly said Wednesday. The partial reopening comes as other national parks begin or prepare to raise their gates at the urging of President Donald Trump. Complicating Yellowstone’s reopening, Wyoming recently lifted a 14-day self-quarantine order for out-of-state visitors on nonessential business, but one remains in Montana. Sholly nonetheless described Yellowstone’s split approach as a good way to help rangers get ready for a new visitor experience that will discourage shoulder-to-shoulder crowding at thermal features – summer scenes common in Yellowstone. “I would prefer it’s not just a light switch and the park is open and we get inundated and overwhelmed and aren’t able to handle it,” Sholly said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/27/unaffected-counties-closed-swimming-holes-news-around-states/112436326/", "title": "Unaffected counties, closed swimming holes: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama Superintendent of Education Eric Mackey on Friday estimated that up to half of the state’s public school students will be attending classes remotely in the fall because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mackey said more than a quarter of students are in systems that are only doing remote classes for the first part of the year. He said as many as 15% to 30% of students will be choosing to do remote learning in school systems that offer the option, in addition to in-person classes. “My request for everybody is for patience. I know people are frustrated. I know people are in many cases scared. … But I promise you, there are thousands of educators who have the best interest of your children at heart. And it will be a struggle, and we will get through it,” Mackey said. He said the precautions taken by local school systems “will protect them as much as we can” but acknowledged there is risk.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A seafood processing plant has found 56 employees tested positive for COVID-19, marking the latest outbreak in the industry, health officials said. The Anchorage Health Department announced Friday that testing was conducted July 17-22, and more workers could test positive, as 30 test results are still pending. The plant is owned by Copper River Seafoods and employs 134 workers, many who live in the city. “This is a concerning situation for the people of Anchorage,” said Bruce Chandler, disease control and prevention medical officer with the city health department. “With so many workers now testing positive, it is likely that this outbreak has been in progress for some time and that transmission has already occurred among family, friends and others in the community.” The city and state health departments have started contact tracing, and employees at the plant are being isolated, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: This year’s wildfire season has been extra challenging for firefighters, as crews have had to battle some massive fires around the state while dealing with changes in their routine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic firefighters had their own way of life including routine morning briefings, respectful handshakes and community meals. But now, every meal is prepackaged, and firefighters have to eat 6 to 10 feet apart, crew members wave at each other instead of shaking hands, and they attend virtual briefs on their smartphones or radios instead of massive, crowded in-person ones. On top of that, Arizona has had a tough wildfire season due to a wet winter and dry summer conditions that fed massive fires across the state. Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 cases among firefighters have been successful so far, according to fire officials, with only one crew member testing positive and since recovering.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two state prison inmates have died while being treated for COVID-19, according to the Arkansas Department of Correction. One inmate, a man in his 80s serving a sentence at the Ouachita River Unit in Malvern for sexual assault, died at a Hot Springs hospital, and the second, a man in his 40s serving a burglary sentence at the East Arkansas Regional Unit at Brickeys, died at a hospital in North Little Rock, the department said Friday. Both men, whose names were not released, died Friday, the department said. Department spokesperson Cindy Murphy said more than 3,800 state prison inmates have tested positive for the virus, and 27 have died. The state health department said Friday that 37,249 cases and 394 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported statewide. The true number of cases is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nCalifornia\n\nForesthill: Park officials have shut vehicle access to a pristine swimming hole in Northern California due to an influx of visitors to the “hidden gem” that has become a popular photo backdrop on social media. There are just 12 parking spots near Yankee Jim’s, a sliver of crystal clear water on the North Fork American River, about 35 miles west of Lake Tahoe, but last weekend California State Parks and Placer County authorities counted more than 300 vehicles parked near the rugged roads surrounding a one-way bridge overhead. Some vehicles blocked entry and exit points to the area, causing an hours­long traffic jam as drivers tried to turn around, the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook posting Friday. Authorities said the scenic area has exploded in popularity thanks to social media postings. Authorities are struggling to control overcrowding at recreational sites as coronavirus cases continue to rise in many parts of the state.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: Multiple high schools have said fall sports remain undecided as the state High School Activities Association awaits gubernatorial approval to move forward. District 51 Athletic Director Paul Cain said he has had multiple conversations with Association Commissioner Rhonda Blanford-Green in the past few weeks to discuss options to resume athletics this upcoming school year, The Daily Sentinel reports. “The commissioner has met with the governor and his staff multiple times this week and have made multiple revisions to the plan that is currently on the governor’s desk for approval,” Cain said. There is no timeline for Democratic Gov. Jared Polis’ decision. District 51 is in Mesa County and includes Central, Fruita 8-9, Fruita Monument, Grand Junction, Palisade and R-5 high schools.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that state union leaders predict will provide hundreds, possibly thousands, of front-line workers “presumptive eligibility” for workers’ compensation benefits if they contracted the coronavirus while on the job during the early days of the pandemic. The Democrat’s order came after weeks of demands by workers, union officials and some state legislators who were concerned that workers who were deemed as essential and got infected had no guarantee they’d qualify for compensation to cover lost wages and their medical care. Fewer than one-third of states have enacted such a policy, which shifts the burden of proof for coverage. “Our state owes a debt to all of the health care professionals, grocery store clerks, and other essential workers who served vital roles during the earliest and darkest stages of this public health crisis,” Lamont said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Twelve residents who tested positive for COVID-19 were incorrectly told they had tested negative, state public health officials acknowledged Friday. Officials confirmed the incorrect reports after a Bridgeville man was hospitalized with the virus Thursday after being told he had tested negative. Katey Evans said she didn’t know how long her husband, Kevin, will remain in the hospital. “He sounds like he’s improving,” she said. Evans said she, her husband and their three children went to get tested at a Walgreens pharmacy in Bridgeville after their 6-year-old daughter had tested positive. All were told a few days later that their results had come back negative. On Thursday, Kevin Evans, 41, was taken by ambulance to Beebe Medical Center in Lewes, where a check of the Delaware Health Information Network, a statewide patient information database, indicated that he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Crowds of people gathered at Columbia Heights Civic Plaza on Saturday to continue to call on D.C. leaders to cancel rent during the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. D.C. Tenants Union organized the gathering, which featured speakers addressing eviction and homelessness concerns. Though Mayor Muriel Bowser announced earlier this month that a moratorium on evictions in D.C. would be extended until Oct. 9, supporters at the rally said the threat of a potential crisis could grow even larger with bonus unemployment benefits possibly ending at the end of July. An online petition started by D.C. Tenants Union has gathered thousands of signatures and calls for the cancellation of rent and mortgages during the state of emergency plus one month. The effort also pushes for a two-year freeze on rent increases and a right to counsel in eviction cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: More than 9,300 new coronavirus cases were reported in the state Sunday, accompanied by an additional 78 deaths. As of Sunday, Florida had 423,855 coronavirus cases, an additional 9,344 cases from the previous day, and 5,972 total deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health. The number of new cases was lower than other days last week, but caseloads released on Sundays tend to be smaller because of the lack of workers entering data or in labs testing samples. The statewide median age of coronavirus patients in Florida was 40, the health department said. Almost 3.4 million Floridians have been tested for the virus. The new cases tested over the weekend had a positive rate of 11%, according to the Department of Health.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state reported more than 4,800 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Friday, the highest one-day total since the start of the pandemic, capping a week that also saw the state report its highest-yet death toll. Those confirmed cases came with a new single-day high-water mark in overall tests conducted, at more than 45,000. Georgia Department of Public Health spokeswoman Nancy Nydam said the increase in total tests reported Friday “was from backlogs at a couple of the labs from last week.” The state has recorded more than 160,000 total confirmed cases, though experts say many more people are likely infected but never tested. There were 3,135 hospitalized with the virus in Georgia on Friday, nearly double the 1,570 people hospitalized July 1. Deaths have been rising sharply in the state. Last week saw Georgia report its second-, third- and fourth-highest death counts since the start of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Investigators with the state attorney general’s office arrested a 20-year-old woman after seeing videos of her dancing in a store and dining out when she was supposed to be obeying a traveler quarantine the state mandated to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Anne Salamanca arrived in Honolulu on July 6, and four days later, the Hawaii Tourism Authority learned she was out in public, in violation of the 14-day quarantine, the state said in a news release Friday. The tourism authority informed attorney general special agents, who were shown videos of her dancing and dining. The state’s news release said Salamanca is from Birmingham, Alabama. She’s also a “social media influencer” in the Philippines who goes by Mika Salamanca and arrived from Manila, KITV reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Thursday that there are too many coronavirus infections, and the state will remain in the fourth and final stage of his plan to reopen during the pandemic for at least another two weeks. The Republican governor also reemphasized his plan for state-local collaborations in dealing with the pandemic, allowing local leaders to determine restrictions as the state deals with a surge of infections. That means the state’s seven health districts and local officials will continue evaluating conditions in their areas and decide on restrictions with Little’s oversight. Little said he was visiting four of the state’s health districts Thursday to help them make decisions that would also include information from the state epidemiologist and the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. He didn’t rule out at some point issuing a statewide face-covering mandate if infections rise to the point where the health care system is overwhelmed.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Just weeks away from the ringing of the schoolhouse bell, scores of people rallied at the state Capitol on Saturday against the state’s requirement that schoolchildren must wear face coverings this fall to discourage transmission of the highly contagious and potentially deadly coronavirus. In a state where the numbers of cases of COVID-19 are rising, the protesters took aim at Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s broadside last week that people who forgo face coverings are “the enemy.” “I don’t think all this pressure needs to be put on the kids,” said Adam Dunn of Decatur, whose kids are out of school. “They need freedom to go play, have a childhood.” The “Million Unmasked March” drew about 250 people, including a stalwart group of counterdemonstrators who periodically let loose their own shouted protests from across the street.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state reported 860 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and eight deaths Sunday, a day ahead of a statewide mask mandate. The Indiana State Department of Health said Sunday that 62,372 people in the state have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. More than 2,706 people have died from it. Gov. Eric Holcomb has announced a statewide face mask mandate starts Monday, pointing to renewed growth in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations. The Republican’s executive order leaves it up to state and local health departments to enforce compliance. He dropped a criminal penalty from the mandate after criticism from some law enforcement officials and conservative lawmakers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a proclamation Friday extending an order that bars and restaurants require patrons to remain at least 6 feet apart to limit spread of the coronavirus. The proclamation also extends other requirements, including that bar and restaurant patrons each have seats at a table or bar and that operators maintain “increased hygiene practices.” In addition, the governor’s order extends existing rules for fitness centers, casinos, senior citizen centers and other businesses. Reynolds last week encouraged residents to wear masks in public but has declined to issue requirements that people wear masks. She also has said local officials don’t have the authority to institute mask orders. The governor noted she would not extend the suspension of a requirement that retailers accept empty cans and bottles for redemption of container deposits. The requirement that retailers take the containers resumed Sunday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some businesses in two western Kansas counties that have yet to report a single positive coronavirus case aren’t requiring customers to wear face masks, but they are asking whether they have traveled outside the county. Business owners in Rawlins and Wallace counties say they agree with local officials’ decisions to opt out of an order from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly requiring people to wear masks in public. In Wallace County, which borders Colorado, one restaurant posted on social media a graphic of a crossed-out man with a face mask. Kansas has reported more than 25,000 coronavirus cases since the pandemic reached the state. State officials have been alarmed at a resurgence of the virus over the past six weeks. But so far, Rawlins County, with about 1,500 residents, and Wallace County, with about 2,500, remain no-case islands on the state health department’s coronavirus map.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear announced 836 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, breaking Friday’s record for the second-highest single-day total. “Today’s numbers continue a concerning increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in our commonwealth,” Beshear said in a news release. “We expect to take additional steps next week if the case numbers don’t stabilize.” There were also five new deaths Saturday, raising the state’s death toll to 696. “We know how to control this virus,” the governor said. “We’ve seen states like New York – which had hospitals overflowing with sick patients in March and April – now reporting a positivity rate of 1% or less. If they can do it, we can do it.” Beshear said wearing face coverings was critical to achieving that. Kentucky’s record for new coronavirus cases in a single day stands at 979, which came July 18. The Bluegrass State has seen an uptick in cases over the past couple of weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The mayor shut down the city’s bars because of rising coronavirus numbers and has also forbid restaurants from selling alcoholic drinks to go. “The crowds just grow and grow and grow,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a livestreamed news conference Friday. “Even when we were allowing for takeout alcohol, some of the lines were so long they would become a gathering in themselves. And no mask-wearing and the like.” The city is also getting many complaints about large parties of maskless people outside houses, said Jennifer Avegno, head of the city’s health department. Cantrell warned short-term rental owners that big parties at their properties could cost their licenses. “I’m not playing around,” she said. The rule against all takeout sales of alcoholic drinks in a city where go-cups have long been a barroom feature took effect at 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A water district is collecting sewage samples for testing to determine the prevalence of the coronavirus based on what’s being flushed down the toilet. The Greater Augusta Utility District began collecting samples of sewage last week at its wastewater treatment plant. Those samples are being sent to a Massachusetts company that’s pioneering efforts to test for traces of the coronavirus in sewage collected from treatment plants. The data could provide information on how widespread the virus is in the local population and could aid local officials in their decision-making, the Kennebec Journal reports. Most data on the spread of the coronavirus currently comes from individual testing. The water district, using Keep Maine Healthy funding obtained by the city of Augusta, hopes to take advantage of another measure of the virus’s prevalence, or lack thereof, in a community.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s prison system has received more than 2 million pieces of personal protective equipment since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but advocates for workers and offenders say they’ve been hardly enough to stem the virus’s spread behind bars. The nearly 2.2 million items include gowns, gloves, hand sanitizer, surgical masks, and other face and eye protections, state prison spokesperson Mark Vernarelli told The Baltimore Sun. Patrick Moran, council president for the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, said the amount really isn’t that much because workers and inmates go through so much PPE in buildings where social distancing is virtually impossible. “That’s a big number. However, roughly 26,000 people are going through it every day, and some items are used daily or every other day,” Moran said. More than 1,100 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Maryland prisons.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Travelers to Massachusetts, including residents returning home after out-of-state trips, face $500-per-day fines if they refuse to comply with a new executive order requiring them to quarantine for 14 days to control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Friday. The order that takes effect Aug. 1 comes at the height of the summer tourist season and not long before tens of thousands of college students typically flock to the state for the start of fall classes. There are exemptions for people coming from low-risk states, which currently include New York, New Jersey, Maine and Hawaii, and for people who can prove they have had a negative COVID-19 test no more than 72 hours prior to arrival, the Republican governor said. There are also exemptions for people simply passing through the state, those who commute across state lines for work, and those traveling for medical treatment or to comply with military orders.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has extended a ban on family visitors at nursing homes and congregate care sites through Aug. 31. There’s an exception for people who want to see someone in serious or critical condition or in hospice care. Whitmer’s office announced an extension of her previous order Thursday night. Facilities must make “best efforts” to help residents communicate with people by phone or electronic devices, Whitmer said. Some people in nursing homes and assisted living centers have only seen visitors through a window. “We must remain vigilant in our fight against COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable citizens from the spread of this virus. … I know seniors and their families are making sacrifices every day during this crisis,” Whitmer said. The Department of Health and Human Services has discretion to make exceptions to parts of the order, the governor said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials are concerned about renewed pressure on the testing supply chain, which could affect the state’s response to a recent growth in cases and plans to continue to ramp up testing. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said during a press call Friday that state officials have received reports of delays or reductions in testing supplies like reagents and pipettes from some health systems across the state, which rely on their own supply channels for weekly shipments of testing equipment. Testing supply shortages and delays may be contributing to longer wait times for results, which have gone from 24 hours to a few days. Minnesota has been acquiring testing supplies to augment health systems’ stocks and coordinating between testing sites to redistribute equipment to prevent further supply chain challenges. Malcolm said supply chain issues can affect the state’s ability to ramp up testing capacity and hinder the state’s response.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor is setting new restrictions on bars and social gatherings to curb the spread of the coronavirus among a group he called “young, drunk, careless folks.” “Our bars must look more like restaurants and less like mobs of COVID-19 spread,” Gov. Tate Reeves said during a Friday afternoon media briefing. Reeves said cases of coronavirus have been rising steadily in people in their 20s who are not being responsible under the current regulations. Right now, bars and restaurants can be open in the state if they serve only 50% of their capacity for patrons. Under the new rules, they can still be open at 50% capacity, but people will need to be seated to order alcohol. Additionally, alcohol sales will cut off at 11 p.m. “We know that’s when these crowds, primarily of young people, throw social distancing out the window,” Reeves said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A woman is suing the city over its decision to require face coverings, saying the health of others “is not my responsibility.” Rachel Shelton is asking the court to temporarily stop an ordinance and to rule that it violates her rights. The Springfield law follows a big spike in new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in southwestern Missouri and across the state. “Your health is not my responsibility,” Shelton said at a news conference Thursday. “Your emotional well-being is not my responsibility.” Springfield, Missouri’s third-largest city, is among several jurisdictions in the state that have begun requiring face coverings in many public places. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have risen sharply since Republican Gov. Mike Parson allowed the state to reopen for business in mid-June.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A senior home that has been pummeled by a coronavirus outbreak that infected nearly every resident has seen another death as the number of confirmed virus cases to date topped 3,000 statewide Friday. Health officials confirmed 129 additional cases of the virus, one of the highest daily totals yet. Yellowstone County, which includes Billings, again accounted for the highest number of new cases, with 40. Health officials also announced the first death from the virus in Glacier County – a woman in her 80s – bringing the number of fatalities in the state to 46. Glacier County includes much of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and parts of Glacier National Park. Canyon Creek Memory Care in Billings saw its 15th death Thursday. More than a quarter of the 59 residents living at the facility when an outbreak erupted three weeks ago have now died.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to see high numbers of coronavirus cases, according to state health figures, as the prison system reported four additional staffers testing positive for the virus. The Lincoln Correctional Center, Diagnostic and Evaluation Center in Lincoln, Omaha Correctional Center and the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln each reported a staffer testing positive for the virus, according to a news release late Thursday from the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. All four were self-isolating at home, officials said. The announcement brings the total number of prison employees across the state to be infected with the virus to 37. Nebraska’s hospitals also showed signs of being affected by the rising case numbers. The state’s online virus tracker showed 34% of the state’s hospital intensive care unit beds available Friday, a drop of 4 percentage points since Monday. Available ICU beds also dropped to 35% from Monday’s 42%.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court denied a rural church’s request late Friday to strike down as unconstitutional a 50-person cap on worship services as part of the state’s ongoing response to the coronavirus. In a 5-4 decision, the high court refused to grant the request from the Christian church east of Reno to be subjected to the same COVID-19 restrictions in Nevada that allow casinos, restaurants and other businesses to operate at 50% of capacity with proper social distancing. Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley argued that the hard cap on religious gatherings was an unconstitutional violation of its parishioners’ First Amendment rights to express and exercise their beliefs. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal majority in denying the request without explanation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday vetoed a bill that would have raised the state’s minimum wage, saying it creates negative unintended consequences that are only “exacerbated” by the economic situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Sununu said in his veto message that a law can force an employer to pay a minimum wage, but it cannot force an employer to hire or retain a worker at that wage or to continue offering the same number of hours to that worker. “This bill would have meant fewer jobs and fewer available hours for our workers who are unemployed or underemployed. It would mean our employers who are fighting for survival would have one more burden placed on their backs as they try to recover,” he said in a statement. The bill would have raised the wage from $7.25 an hour to $10 an hour in 2021 and $12 in 2023. Sununu vetoed a similar bill last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State officials provided more details Friday on the reopening of schools this fall, including that parents will be allowed to opt their children out from in-person learning without having to demonstrate a risk of illness or other special circumstance. The amended guidelines represent a shift from guidance released four weeks ago by Gov. Phil Murphy that required in-person instruction, though school districts were given latitude to decide the number of days students would be required to report in person and whether they could also use online learning. “All students are eligible for fulltime remote learning; eligibility cannot be conditioned on a family/guardian demonstrating a risk of illness or other selective criteria,” the guidance says. School districts must have clearly communicated policies on remote learning and procedures for students to transition back to in-person learning when ready, interim Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer said Friday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Health officials say the state has 324 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 18,788. State data released Saturday by the state Department of Health also showed six new deaths from the novel coronavirus. The number of deaths in New Mexico related to COVID-19 now stands at 607. Bernalillo County led all counties in new cases with 93. Dona Ana County reported 64 new cases. The state said there were also three cases among federal inmates at the Cibola County Correctional Center, one case among federal inmates at Otero County Prison Facility and ten cases among Immigration and Custom’s Enforcement detainees at the Otero County Processing Center. There are 148 people hospitalized with the virus, 32 of them on ventilators, and 7,268 designated as having recovered, state health officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: More than 100 bars and restaurants in the New York City area were flagged for coronavirus social distancing violations over the weekend, and some now face the possible suspension of their liquor licenses, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. The violations, for issues such as people crowding outside and workers not wearing masks, were handed out by a new state police and liquor authority enforcement task force inspecting establishments in the city and on Long Island, Cuomo said. The state’s liquor authority board will meet Monday to review the 105 violations and decide on the possible suspension of some licenses. Last week, the board yanked 10 licenses for social distancing violations. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Cuomo said the state tallied three deaths from coronavirus Saturday, while hospitalizations for the disease fell to 637, the lowest total since mid-March.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: University of North Carolina school system officials have voted to keep tuition rates the same regardless of whether classes move online because of coronavirus concerns. Thursday’s split vote by the school system’s Board of Governors also keeps the same fees for athletics and student activities, news outlets report. “It is important that our universities continue to operate and provide instruction and essential services,” the board’s resolution said. “And the tuition and fees that we collect are important to sustaining this important mission not just for today’s students, but for the students who will attend our institutions in the future.” The vote comes as the school system continues to prepare for different scenarios for its budget amid the coronavirus pandemic, and as students and staff gear up to return to its campuses this fall, The News & Observer reports.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials reported 124 new coronavirus infections Saturday but no new deaths. The number of new positive cases raises the statewide total since the pandemic reached North Dakota in mid-March to 5,736. North Dakota’s death toll from the coronavirus remained at 99 as of Saturday. The number of North Dakota patients currently hospitalized rose to 39 on Saturday, up two from Friday. There were 126 new recoveries reported, bringing the total number to 4,671 since the pandemic began.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Lawyers who volunteer as poll workers could earn continuing education credit hours in exchange, under a program announced by the Ohio Supreme Court and the state elections chief, as the state faces a poll worker shortage because of the coronavirus pandemic. To earn the four hours of credit under the initiative, participating attorneys must complete training at local election boards and work the entire voting day. Workers typically serve from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., when polls close. “I can think of no greater opportunity for lawyers in Ohio to give back to our state than to get involved on Election Day and help fill the urgent need for poll workers,” Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor said. Ohio has about 44,000 licensed attorneys. They must earn 24 continuing education hours every two years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The head of coronavirus response at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center said Friday that an increase in the number of younger Oklahoma residents dying as a result of the virus has become a worry. Although most of the 484 deaths reported in the state due to COVID-19 remain in the 65-and-older age group with nearly 80%, an increase in deaths among those 36-49 years old shows it can kill younger people as well and is more worrisome than an increase of nearly 5,000 in reported cases in the state during the past week, Dr. Dale Bratzler said. “What concerns me even more (than the increase in cases) is that in the past seven days 39 deaths have been reported, and while the majority of them are that age group of 65 and older, there have been a number of deaths in younger people this past week … in their mid-40s. So this virus can cause death in younger age group people,” Bratzler said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Nine more people in the state have died from COVID-19, the highest number of deaths reported in one day since the pandemic began, health officials said Friday. The newly reported deaths raised the state’s death toll to 282, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The authority also reported 396 new confirmed and presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the state total to more than 16,100. An outbreak of 22 COVID-19 cases has been reported at Norris Blueberry Farm in Roseburg, health officials also said Friday. The case count includes everyone linked to the outbreak, officials said. The investigation started June 25, but the initial case count was below the threshold for public disclosure, officials said. In the month of July, Oregon has averaged about 315 cases a day, officials said last week, calling the numbers concerning.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The many school districts across the state that have not settled on how and when they will restart instruction this fall will be making decisions in the coming weeks, and the pandemic plans that have been produced so far are all over the map. That’s by design, the state education secretary said Friday, as he encouraged districts to customize state-issued guidelines for their particular conditions. School districts must have a board-approved plan posted online before they can resume in-person instruction for the first time since Secretary Pedro Rivera and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf shuttered schools for the year in March. State guidelines call for 6 feet of social distancing “to the maximum extent possible,” a goal that may prove difficult.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has enlisted the help of two pediatricians to reassure parents that it is safe to reopen the state’s schools Aug. 31 as she has planned. Her reopening plan has received pushback from parents, teachers and administrators who don’t think the coronavirus will be under adequate control by that date. Dr. Jim McDonald of the state Department of Health and Dr. Elizabeth Lange, former president of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians, said during a live forum Thursday that while there is no way to make in-person learning risk-free, there are ways to minimize it. While there are risks with sending kids back to school, there are other risks in keeping them at home, Lange said. “Children are feeling the stress from the lack of a routine,” she said. “Kids are staying up all night. They are afraid to go outside. They are more sedentary. Getting back to a routine is very important.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state pushed past 80,000 Sunday. The increase of 1,412 is the fewest new cases in more than two weeks, according to numbers released by the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Weekend numbers can sometimes vary because of delayed reporting. The number of new deaths confirmed from the respiratory illness rose by 25 to 1,436. Of the 7,500 total tests reported Sunday, 15.6% were positive. That’s lower than in recent days, but South Carolina continues to have one of the highest positivity rates among the states, a key indicator the state may not be doing enough testing to control the virus. The state says it has 96 mobile testing events scheduled over the next five weeks. Department officials continue to say they don’t have an accurate count of how many people are hospitalized with COVID-19 because of the transition to a new tracking system mandated by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State health officials reported 105 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday but no deaths. The state has recorded more than 8,300 cases of the coronavirus, but about 88% of them have recovered. A total of 122 people have died over the course of the pandemic. The number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 increased one to 46 on Saturday, while the number of active infections was at 876, up 69 from Friday. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s attorney general says mask mandates are constitutionally defensible in an opinion that comes as some county mayors have moved to enact the requirements. Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III wrote in an opinion Friday that for more than a century, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that “a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” Slatery wrote that courts can only overturn orders that have no “real or substantial relation” to protecting public health or are “beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.” When determining if a face mask mandate could be unconstitutional, Slatery concluded that the mandate doesn’t amount to a “plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston-area officials announced Friday that they have ordered all public and non-religious private schools not to reopen for in-person instruction until at least Sept. 8 because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On-campus instruction might be delayed further based on public health conditions, Harris County officials said. The announcement came as Texas continued to report a near-record number of deaths related to COVID-19. State health officials reported 168 COVID-19-related fatalities Saturday. “Right now, we continue to see a severe and uncontrolled spread of this virus, and it would be self-defeating to reopen schools as usual for in-person instruction,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southwest Utah is seeing another drop in coronavirus cases, similar to the drop the five-county region saw the week before last, but officials want to see more before officially calling it a downturn. Southwest Utah Public Health Department Public Information Officer David Heaton noted late last week that it was too early to label the recent numbers an official trend. “We would want to see several more days of lower numbers to indicate a possible down turn,” Heaton said in a text message. “Anything recent wouldn’t be a contributing factor yet.” That sentiment remained true Friday. While the southwest region of Kane, Beaver, Garfield, Iron and Washington Counties counted 97 cases between Tuesday and Thursday – 29 on Tuesday, 37 Wednesday and 31 Thursday – the region added 78 cases Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Friday issued an order requiring people in the state to wear masks in public as part of an ongoing effort to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Scott said the outbreaks hitting the South and West may be spreading back toward the Northeast and Vermont. “We are still in very good shape, but it is time to prepare,” the Republican said, noting it’s better to take precautions than to have to roll back the reopening, as has happened in a number of hard-hit states. Under the order that takes effect Aug. 1, all public and private businesses must display signs saying masks are required for anyone over age 2. Businesses are allowed to refuse service to people not wearing a mask. There are a number of exemptions, including people who are eating or drinking or engaged in strenuous exercise or those who have a medical exemption. People who do not wear a mask are not required to produce evidence of their condition.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The State Fair of Virginia has been canceled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fair’s organizers were unable to find a way to pull it off safely. Pam Wiley, director of communications for the Virginia Farm Bureau, said staff spent months trying to figure out ways to make the fair work within state health guidelines. They wanted everyone from fairgoers and vendors to staff and volunteers to be safe. Wiley said the last time the fair was canceled was during World War II. Before that it was during the Spanish flu epidemic in 1918. More than 245,000 people attended the fair last year. “We will be back in 2021,” Wiley said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A federal judge on Friday denied a request for a preliminary injunction against Gov. Jay Inslee’s emergency coronavirus orders that had been brought by some Republican state lawmakers. Filed in May, the legal challenge contended that “the emergency has been contained” and that ongoing restrictions for businesses, workers and residents weren’t legally justified, The Seattle Times reports. The legal challenge was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Judge Benjamin Settle wrote in a court order dated Friday that federal lawsuits against state officials are allowed in certain instances in which the state official has a connection with the enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional act. However, Inslee’s lawyers persuasively argued that while the governor issues emergency orders, other officials actually enforce those orders, Settle wrote.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGary: The town has been without water service for several days after a pump broke, prompting concerns about a shortage of a precious resource during the coronavirus pandemic. Residents of the 563-customer system are having to scramble to get water for doing things as simple as washing their hands – a heightened priority during the COVID-19 scare. “Right now we’re currently in a health crisis due to the water outage,” city Treasurer Tracy Allison said. After a pump in the city’s water system broke last week, residents have been using creek water to flush toilets, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. City officials have made donated bottled water available, local firefighters are making deliveries in communities hit by the outage, and water is being provided by tankers from the West Virginia National Guard and the city of Welch.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Police are investigating threats made against city officials over a new mandate requiring face coverings in public buildings because of the coronavirus. Alderman Randy Scannell, who first proposed the mask ordinance, said one email called him a traitor who must die and indicated the sender would make sure Scannell would die. He said it appears multiple people are sending threatening emails to council members and city officials, including the mayor. Police Chief Andrew Smith said all 12 council members, regardless of how they voted on the ordinance, received at least one of the threats. Smith emailed all city officials, telling them to be vigilant, WLUK-TV reports. Council member Lynn Gerlach called the threats “unsettling” and took them as a sign of how much the mask issue has become a flashpoint.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Department of Corrections has a new acting director. Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement that deputy director Dan Shannon would replace Bob Lampert, who announced his retirement last week after serving as director since 2003, KTWO-AM radio reports. Shannon has 34 years of experience in corrections and has been with the department since 2007. He has also served as prison division administrator and the warden of the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. Lampert retired after a 46-year career in corrections, starting in 1974 in the Marine Corps in military police corrections. During his tenure, he worked to improve laws to aid offender success and employee safety as well as with various agencies on alternatives to incarceration. Authorities say the department has been performing well despite the challenges of COVID-19 and looming budget reductions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/27/bomber-boneyard-flying-farmer-crashes-blueberry-bonanza-news-around-states/118952548/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The state is considering whether to use $400million in pandemic relief funds to build new prisons, a proposal Gov. Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Shantel Smith, 34, who is from Toronto, is a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow Church,.and Liana Wallace, 20, who is from Evanston, Illinois, is a junior at Georgetown University. The Emmy Award-winning series returns this fall on CBS as 18 new castaways will compete for $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A ferret has tested positive for the coronavirus in Florida, the first ferret to test positive for the virus in the United States, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release. A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking. It’s difficult to try to explain things to them. … I know there is a lot of misleading information out there and I know sources are trying to cut down on that, but you can’t eliminate them all. It’s unbelievable some of the fictitious stuff that’s out there and people are buying into.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/31/governors-ball-tabernacle-theft-witch-pardon-news-around-states/50305421/", "title": "Governor's ball, tabernacle theft: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An attorney for an inmate who was the subject of a national manhunt after escaping with the apparent help of a jail official said he will ask to move his trial to another city. Mark McDaniel, an attorney representing Casey White, said he will seek a change of venue to move his upcoming capital murder trial and the separate escape case to a new location. When Casey White disappeared with jailer Vicky White, he was awaiting trial on a charge of killing a woman in 2015.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration is suing the state over fishing rights on a river that runs through a national wildlife refuge, saying Alaska is undermining federal efforts to limit harvests when fish numbers are low to residents in the area of predominantly Indigenous villages. U.S. Interior Department spokesperson Melissa Schwartz said the openings violated federal law and interfered with a priority for rural subsistence use under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey is in Israel for five days of talks with political and business leaders. Ducey arrived in Israel on Sunday morning, accompanied by the heads of the Arizona Commerce Authority and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ducey spokesperson C.J. Karamargin said the Republican governor’s meetings would focus on trade, water and border security. Ducey has worked over his seven years in office to boost economic ties with Israel, which has a similar arid climate and water and security issues. His plans included meeting with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and President Isaac Herzog, as well as former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also was slated to meet with the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Thomas Nides; pay a Memorial Day visit to Israel’s 9/11 memorial in Jerusalem; meet with the city’s mayor; and visit some historic sites.\n\nArkansas\n\nCharleston: The city honored the 1954 integration of its school district – the first public district to do so in the South – with a memorial celebrating the July 27, 1954, decision to desegregate Charleston Public Schools. The decision followed the May 17, 1954, U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which determined that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. On Aug. 23, 1954, 11 Black students – three ninth graders and eight elementary school children – attended class alongside 480 white students. Barbara Dotson was one of the 11 Black students to attend school alongside white students. She became the first Black female student to graduate from the Charleston School District.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A school district has been unable to identify who subjected a Black assistant principal to racist graffiti and messages on social media even after a six-month investigation in which 45 witnesses were interviewed. Elysse Versher, assistant principal at the West Campus High School, told The Sacramento Bee she planned to resign, saying the Sacramento City Unified School District failed to protect her from the harassment and does not take incidents of racism and hate crimes seriously. Versher was made aware in November of social media posts by students calling her racial slurs and criticizing her enforcement of school dress codes. She found racist graffiti painted on a wall across from her parking spot. West Campus is a public college prep school for academic achievers. The school’s dress code states that students cannot wear clothing that promotes violence, drugs or alcohol or hate speech. Students cannot wear helmets or hoods that obscure the face unless required by the student’s religious practices. Versher said back in November that she has been disrespected and even threatened by parents of non-Black students and that non-Black students do not respect her authority. “They do not respect me as a human being,” she said. District officials expressed frustration over the results of their investigation.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Mountain National Park: A climber was killed and two others were injured Sunday after a rock fall and avalanche in Rocky Mountain National Park, officials said. A woman suffered minor injuries, and a man who suffered more serious injuries was rescued by a Colorado National Guard helicopter using a hoist during a break in wintry weather, a park press release said. The park’s search and rescue team was looking for another man who was with the other two climbers near the Dreamweaver Couloir on Mount Meeker at the time of the avalanche Sunday morning, it said. Search crews found his body in avalanche debris about 5:15 p.m. Sunday, park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said. The identities of the victims were not immediately released. The avalanche was witnessed by climbers in the area.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The nation’s energy secretary and Danish wind developer Orsted say they want American union workers to build offshore wind farms to dot U.S. coastlines – the building trades workers who could otherwise be left out of a transition to renewable resources. The Biden administration wants to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, generating enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm visited the New London State Pier facility this month to see how Orsted, energy provider Eversource and the state of Connecticut are transforming it into a hub for the offshore wind industry. At a press conference afterward, the Democratic governor and Democratic congressmen spoke about creating American jobs – messaging that will surely play into their reelection campaigns. Gov. Ned Lamont said there are “hundreds of good paying jobs right here,” and “we’re just getting started.” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal thanked the unions, saying that “this is the future of energy in the United States of America right here.” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney said they’re maximizing every opportunity for the state to grow in a sustainable way. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, the only one not up for reelection, echoed the same message, saying offshore wind is the “holy grail of public policy” because it creates jobs, helps the local economy, makes the country more secure and helps save the planet.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State House leaders chastised a fellow Democrat who suggested in an online discussion that those who don’t support mask-wearing amid an uptick in COVID-19 cases but do support gun rights should kill themselves with their firearms. House leaders gave no indication, however, that they want to pursue formal disciplinary action against Rep. John Kowalko, who made the comment in a post following last week’s Texas school shooting but later deleted his Facebook comments and apologized. Kowalko, a Newark Democrat who once described himself as “your textbook liberal, progressive Dem,” made the remark about guns last week in an online back-and-forth with a conservative commenter over whether people should wear masks. Delaware House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst and Majority Whip Larry Mitchell said in a joint statement released Friday that Kowalko’s comments were “offensive and indefensible.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro riders who take the Orange Line will have to deal with several station closures as crews work on reconstruction and improvements, WUSA-TV reports. The closures, which began Saturday, are expected to last more than three months. According to a release from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the closures will affect the New Carrollton, Landover, Cheverly, Deanwood and Minnesota Avenue stations until Sept. 5. WMATA said free shuttle bus services along three routes and free parking for Metro customers at the closed stations will be available. The closures are part of Metro’s “Platform Improvement Project,” which aims to reconstruct the aging concrete platforms at 20 stations. WMATA said 17 stations have completed the renovations over the past 21/ 2 years.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: There’s nothing to indicate the Florida Department of Health told an employee to falsify COVID-19 data, and she wasn’t fired out of retaliation, according to a state investigator’s report released this month. Former department employee Rebekah Jones received national attention when she raised questions about the state’s COVID-19 dashboard and claimed she was fired for exposing problems. The state said she was fired for insubordination after being reprimanded several times. An inspector general’s 268-page report found no evidence of wrongdoing or retaliation by the department. Jones, a Democrat who is running for the U.S. House seat now held by Republican Matt Gaetz, is also facing criminal charges after authorities said she illegally accessed the Department of Health’s computer system to send a message to 1,750 people and downloaded confidential data and saved it to her devices.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Workers cooking burgers and tater tots in a Sonic fast-food kitchen fled after discovering a nonvenomous ball python hiding behind the deep fryer. Police Lt. Matthew Wilson found employees of the Sonic drive-in huddled in the parking lot when he arrived to investigate May 21. On the phone, they described the culprit as brown with diamonds on its back. “When I saw it, I could tell it was just a ball python and not a rattlesnake,” Wilson told The Brunswick News. He not only removed the large snake but also found it a new home with a friend who has a large terrarium and a fondness for snakes. Wilson said the python likely slipped into the Sonic’s kitchen through an open back door, finding a cozy spot for its cold-blooded body behind the hot fryer. Police don’t know where the snake came from, though Wilson said it had likely been a pet that got turned loose by its owner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A contractor hired by the Navy is recommending a series of structural repairs to a massive fuel tank farm at Pearl Harbor to make sure the facility doesn’t leak petroleum when its tanks are drained, a report released Friday said. The recommendations for the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility came after the complex’s pipes leaked fuel into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, sickening thousands of military families. The Pentagon has since agreed to comply with a state order to drain the tanks and permanently shut them down. The Navy has a June 30 deadline to inform the state Department of Health when and how it plans to drain the fuel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A woman charged with killing her two youngest children and her new husband’s previous wife will be tried alongside her husband, and their trial has been delayed until early next year because the judge said that will give her attorneys enough time to effectively prepare a defense. Judge Steven Boyce ruled that delaying Lori Vallow Daybell’s trial another 90 days to Jan. 9 would not violate her rights for a speedy trial. Vallow and her husband, Chad, have pleaded not guilty and could face the death penalty if they are convicted.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The discovery of the bodies of three women inside a senior housing facility this month left the city looking for answers to questions that were supposed to be addressed after a far longer, hotter heat wave killed more than 700 people nearly three decades ago. The city is facing the reality that because of climate change, deadly heat waves can strike just about anywhere, don’t only fall in the height of summer, and need not last long. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office has yet to determine the causes of death for the three women whose bodies were found in the James Sneider Apartments on May 14. But the victims’ families have already filed or plan to file wrongful death lawsuits against the companies that own and manage the buildings. It took the sight of refrigerated trucks being filled with dead bodies after Chicago’s 1995 heat wave to drive home the message that the city was woefully unprepared for a silent and invisible disaster that took more than twice as many lives as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. That realization led to a system in which city workers call the elderly and frail and turn city buildings into 24-hour cooling centers when temperatures become oppressive. What happened this month is a reminder that the type of safeguards in place to make sure people don’t freeze to death because they have not paid their heating bills often do not exist to prevent people from overheating in their homes.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: An agreement that will bring $75 million over the next 10 years to Purdue’s West Lafayette campus has officially been signed between the university and Rolls-Royce. Backed up by over 70 years of partnership, the relationship between Purdue and Rolls-Royce has been highlighted through millions of dollars invested in aerospace testing technology, graduate student research fellowships, and 600-plus Purdue alumni in Rolls-Royce’s workforce, according to a release from the university. The funds from this agreement will go toward gas turbine and electrical and digital technology research, with most of the investment going towards Zucrow Laboratories. In April, Purdue also announced plans for a $73 million, 55,000-square-foot propulsion laboratory for hypersonic technologies in Purdue’s Discovery Park District. “Purdue’s research partnership with Rolls-Royce will address some of the greatest technology challenges facing the U.S,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said in the release. “Our faculty and students will work on advanced technology capabilities to ensure long-term national security. This will enhance the university’s role as a world leader in engineering research.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Families could soon be able to open-enroll their children in other school districts at any point during the year after the Legislature passed a bill last week that removes a March 1 deadline. Republicans framed the legislation as a way to give parents more choice about how their children are educated, while Democrats said it could undermine school districts’ ability to set a budget by April 15 every year, as they are required to do by law. The change was passed as part of the final budget bill of the year. The last-minute push to expand open enrollment in Iowa came after Republicans’ education agenda for the year largely collapsed. Just before the annual legislative session adjourned, House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Harford, said House Republicans lacked the votes to pass a proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds that would have given families taxpayer-funded scholarships to pay private school expenses. Other GOP-backed policies that would have required schools to post their curriculum and library books online also fell by the wayside before the legislative session ended early Wednesday morning. Throughout the legislative session, Republicans have criticized school districts around the state for policies with which they say parents disagree, which they say show parents need other options.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Visitors to the Statehouse will soon be able to honor Gold Star families who have lost a family member in the line of military duty. Senate Bill 330 authorizes the construction of a memorial honoring Kansas Gold Star families. It passed the Legislature unanimously and was signed by Gov. Laura Kelly. The Capitol Preservation Committee is tasked with approving plans for a permanent memorial on Statehouse grounds. The monument will be on the Veterans’ Walk along the sidewalk at the southwest entrance. Public funds cannot be used for the project, which will depend on gifts and other funding.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Incoming high school seniors who have previously taken the ACT will be eligible to retake the standardized test for free, Gov. Andy Beshear said. A statewide ACT retake day will be held this fall on a date chosen by Kentucky’s Department of Education. More information on the date and locations will be shared with schools in the coming months, Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Seventeen years after Hurricane Katrina flooded the city, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed an extensive system of floodgates, strengthened levees and added other protections. The 130-mile ring is designed to hold out a storm surge of about 30 feet around New Orleans and suburbs in three parishes. Congress provided $14.5 billion for what is formally called the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System and related projects. It included two features the Corps described as the world’s largest – a pumping station and a 1.8-mile barrier that can be closed against storm surges. The levees stood up to Hurricane Ida in 2021, though some suburbs outside the system flooded.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A settlement approved for the University of Maine at Augusta president who bowed out amid controversy ensures he will be paid at least $235,000 in the first year. Michael Laliberte will receive an additional $30,000 for a housing allowance on top of his $205,000 salary, which will be paid in a lump sum July 1, the Kennebec Journal reports. If he fails to obtain another job, then he will receive his full salary for another two years, or he will receive the balance if he receives a lower-paying job. University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy was taken to task for failing to disclose to a search committee that Laliberte was the subject of no-confidence votes in his previous job, at State University of New York at Delhi. Malloy has found himself on the receiving end of several no-confidence votes since the controversy began. Malloy, a former Democratic governor of Connecticut, has apologized for the handling of the job search, and Laliberte announced he was declining to take the job as scheduled Aug. 1. The settlement isn’t sitting well with some, especially after nine faculty members were cut the University of Maine at Farmington.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced vetoes of 18 bills Friday, including a measure that would have allowed voters who forget to sign their mail-in ballot envelope to do so after mailing it to get it counted. The Republican governor also vetoed a bill that would have allowed union dues to be tax-deductible, as well as a measure that would have stayed eviction proceedings against tenants who could show they are awaiting a determination about rental assistance. The Maryland General Assembly, which has a supermajority of Democrats, won’t have the chance to override these vetoes when lawmakers convene in January for their regular 90-day session because it is the last year of the term.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: It took more than three centuries, but Elizabeth Johnson Jr., the last Salem “witch” who wasn’t officially pardoned, has been cleared of her supposed crime. Massachusetts lawmakers on Thursday formally exonerated Johnson, clearing her name 329 years after she was convicted of witchcraft in 1693 and sentenced to death at the height of the Salem Witch Trials. Johnson was never executed, but neither was she officially pardoned like others wrongly accused of witchcraft. Lawmakers agreed to reconsider her case last year after a curious eighth grade civics class at North Andover Middle School took up her cause and researched the legislative steps needed to clear her name.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Two more Republican candidates for governor are suing to get on the Aug. 2 primary ballot, just days before the lineup must be settled. James Craig filed a lawsuit Friday night in the Court of Claims, while Michael Markey went to the Court of Appeals on Sunday. They were declared ineligible last week, the result of a tie vote by the Board of State Canvassers. State election officials said they didn’t meet the 15,000-signature threshold because of fraudulent signatures on petitions. Perry Johnson and Donna Brandenburg also didn’t make the ballot. Johnson filed a lawsuit Friday. There seems to be no dispute that fraudulent signatures were turned in by paid circulators, though there’s no evidence that the candidates were aware of the scam. The candidates want courts to order the board to put them on the ballot. They said the elections bureau should have inspected petitions line by line. In Johnson’s case, the appeals court said it could make a decision Tuesday. Five other Republican candidates landed a ballot spot, including Tudor Dixon, a former conservative TV news host who has the backing of Betsy DeVos, head of the U.S. Education Department during the Trump administration.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLafayette: The owner of a rural weekly newspaper in southern Minnesota is looking to give his publication away so he can travel to Ukraine. Minnesota Public Radio reports Lafayette-Nicollet Ledger owner and publisher Lee Zion is willing to dig trenches, teach school or fight in Ukraine. Before he leaves, he wants to give the newspaper away for free. Zion produces the newspaper by himself, reporting, editing and laying out pages for about 500 subscribers, and wants to make sure a person committed to local journalism takes over. He said the towns he covers would suffer if the newspaper disappeared.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Troublesome incidents involving female ride-share passengers and drivers have increased enough to prompt a local entrepreneur to come up with a new business, WLVT-TV reports. Literally Just Ladies is the first of its kind in the Magnolia State, Leigh Sullivan said, and she hopes it will offer safer transportation. She said an app for the company is being developed. Sullivan has been a ride-share driver in Jackson’s metro area for more than six years after doing the same work in her native New Orleans before coming to Mississippi. “And every single time I pick up a female at night, early morning, trying to get to the airport trying to get home from the airport, the first words I hear are, ‘I’m so glad it’s a woman. Thank God, it’s a woman,’ ” she said. Sullivan said she had tossed around the idea of an all-female wing of her transportation business for a while because of the feedback she was getting from her passengers. “And then Nov. 2, my friend Brandy got shot here in Jackson. She got shot seven times. And that was probably the defining moment, like, OK, now is the time.” Brandy Littrell, 36, a Lyft driver, was kidnapped Nov. 2, taken to a wooded area and shot seven times, miraculously surviving the attack.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A swastika was painted on the outside wall of a historically Black church in southwestern Missouri, and police are investigating the vandalism as a hate crime. Pitts Chapel United Methodist Church in Springfield reported the swastika was spray-painted on the building May 18 or 19. The NAACP and the Missouri chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the vandalism. A county parks crew removed the swastika. Pitts Chapel is Springfield’s oldest historically Black church, the Rev. Tracy Wolff said. It was founded in 1847 by a group of enslaved Africans.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal judge has given U.S. wildlife officials 18 months to decide if wolverines should be protected under the Endangered Species Act, following years of dispute over how much risk climate change and other threats pose to the rare and elusive predators. The order from U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy came after environmentalists challenged a 2020 decision under the Trump administration to withhold protections for the animals in the lower 48 states, where no more than 300 are thought to remain. Wildlife officials have previously estimated that 250 to 300 wolverines survive in remote areas of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington state. The animals in recent years also have been documented in California, Utah, Colorado and Oregon.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police arrested a 20-year-old man who had been going door-to-door with a chain saw after he caused a disturbance near a local school. Police said the man was about a quarter of a mile west of the Omaha Veterans Administration Center with the chain saw Friday morning in what they called an attempt to “make money.” Police said a homeowner confronted the man. They argued, and the man threatened the homeowner, who then chased the man. The man dropped his chain saw, but the homeowner tackled him another quarter of a mile to the west, near Holy Cross Catholic Church and its school. Police said the man tried to enter the school to get away from the homeowner, with no intent “to cause harm to anyone inside.” Police said they found several drug pipes on the man. He was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and possessing drug paraphernalia.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A high school honors student said in federal court that he’s being bullied by students and harassed by campus administrators who search him for a gun every time someone identifies him on a state hotline that invites anonymous reports of school threats. “I’m a student, not a threat,” Reno High School junior Lucas Gorelick, 16, told the Associated Press. “I have rights. I want people to know what is happening, and I want to ensure safety for all future students.” A lawsuit filed May 23 in U.S. District Court in Reno argued school district officials have violated Gorelick’s constitutional rights to equal protection and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. He said his backpack and pickup truck were searched five times in two weeks based on anonymous tips, but no weapon was found. He also noted he has been the target of other incidents he termed “bullying situations” that he traced to his Jewish heritage, his work with Democratic party candidates and his school achievements. His father, Jeff Gorelick, characterized a state Department of Education hotline called SafeVoice – established in 2017 after approval from the Legislature – as “an unthinking system” that grants anonymity to bullies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law a $100 million fund to settle sexual and physical abuse claims at a state-run youth detention center. The Legislature approved creating a fund to compensate those who were abused as children at the Sununu Youth Services Center, formerly the Youth Development Center. The Manchester center has been the target of a criminal investigation since 2019, and 11 former workers were arrested last year. Nearly 450 former residents have sued the state, with allegations involving more than 150 staffers from 1963 to 2018. Victims of sexual abuse would be eligible for payments of up to $1.5 million each, while payments to victims of physical abuse would be capped at $150,000. The center is named for former Gov. John H. Sununu, the current governor’s father.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Department of Environmental Protection will distribute $21.4million to counties and municipalities as part of the Clean Communities program to reduce litter and beautify the Garden State. The funding includes just under $19.1 million on the municipal level and $2.3 million awarded to the state’s 21 counties, said DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette. The money represents an increase of about $700,000 over the $20.7 million allocated for the 2021 fiscal year. The additional grant funds will help communities improve their local environments and improve quality of life by removing litter, including from roadways and around stormwater collection systems, LaTourette said. “These community-level efforts have far-reaching impacts across the state, from beautifying neighborhoods to improving water quality and enhancing wildlife habitats,” he said. Counties and municipalities can use the grants to promote litter-related activities such as cleanups and to purchase equipment for the activities. The money can also be used to adopt and enforce anti-littering ordinances and boost public information programs. “We are grateful for funding that helps keep New Jersey litter-free,” said JoAnn Gemenden, executive director of the New Jersey Clean Communities Council.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Students at Mora High School laughed and danced during their prom with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham at the Governor’s Mansion on Thursday night – a silver lining for students during a tumultuous end to the school year. Many students were forced to flee their homes by the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire in recent weeks, and some had only recently returned. Some students arrived decked out in suits and gowns, while others stuck to their roots, showing up in cowboy hats, jeans and boots. Spanish and country music boomed through speakers as students two-stepped across the governor’s back patio. Lujan Grisham said she couldn’t throw a party and sit on the sidelines, so she jumped in to dance the “Cupid Shuffle” with students, state Sen. Leo Jaramillo, D-Española, and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández. “I’m just elated that we could do this for the kids,” said New Mexico Education Secretary Kurt Steinhaus. “I’ve chaperoned a lot of proms – this one’s a little different than I’ve done before.” Lujan Grisham told the Albuquerque Journal a lot of work went into making sure students knew they had a “whole state that cares about their happiness and well-being.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Police say someone busted into the altar at a Brooklyn church, stole a $2 million gold relic and removed the head from a statue of an angel at some point late last week. The incident happened between 6:30 p.m. Thursday and 4 p.m. Saturday at St. Augustine’s Roman Catholic Church, known as the “Notre Dame” of Brooklyn’s Park Slope neighborhood. The church was closed for construction at the time. Camera recordings from the church’s security system were also stolen, the church’s pastor said. The Diocese of Brooklyn called it “a brazen crime of disrespect and hate.” The diocese said the thief or thieves cut through a metal protective casing and made off with a tabernacle dating to the church’s opening in the 1890s. The tabernacle, a box containing Holy Communion items, was made of 18-carat gold and decorated with jewels, police and the diocese said. It’s valued at $2 million. The diocese said it is irreplaceable because of its historical and artistic value. According to a guidebook posted on the church’s website, the tabernacle was built in 1895 and restored in 1952 and 2000. It’s described as a “masterpiece and one of the most expensive tabernacles in the country, guarded by its own security system,” which involves an “electronically operated burglar-proof safe” and 1-inch-thick steel plates that “completely enclose the tabernacle.” Holy Eucharist, bread consecrated as the body of Christ, was taken from the tabernacle and thrown on the altar.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: New Hanover County School Board member Nelson Beaulieu might be out of a job in November. With all absentee and provisional ballots counted, Beaulieu fell behind newcomer Jennah Bosch for the final Democratic nomination for the school board race this fall. But it’s still unknown if that result will hold. Beaulieu is only behind Bosch by two votes, with not even 0.01% of the vote separating them. Beaulieu held a three-vote lead at the end of election night with all precincts reporting, but Bosch overcame that during the official canvass when absentee ballots were counted. With the canvass complete, the results are official, and as of now, Bosch will join Judy Justice, Dorian Cromartie and Veronica McLaurin-Brown as the Democratic candidates in the general election for school board in November. Beaulieu said he has not decided if he will demand a recount. Candidates are allowed to demand recounts if there is less than a 1% split between themselves and the lowest prevailing candidate. With such a slim margin between the candidates, a recount could change the result.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map showed 19% of the state in some form of drought, down from 21% two weeks ago and 80% three months ago, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Three-fourths of the state was suffering through either extreme or exceptional drought in May 2021. The western fourth of the state is still abnormally dry, but no severe, extreme or exceptional drought conditions exist anywhere in the state. Most of the state saw at least a half-inch of rain over the past week, which has helped improve conditions in western North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine announced plans Friday to spend “a significant amount of money” on efforts to ensure every school building in the state is properly protected against an attack. The Republican governor said he has asked the state schools superintendent for an assessment of which schools need such infrastructure additions within the next few days. DeWine did not name a figure but said: “This is not going to be cheap.” He also did not detail the types of security measures, which based on measures some schools already have in place might range from metal detectors to classroom barricade devices.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTaft: Authorities said a 26-year-old man was in custody after one person was killed and seven people were injured in a shooting early Sunday at an outdoor town festival in eastern Oklahoma, where witnesses described frantic people running for cover amid gunfire. An arrest warrant was issued for Skyler Buckner, and he turned himself in to the Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office on Sunday afternoon, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. OSBI said those shot at the Memorial Day event in Taft, located about 45 miles southeast of Tulsa, ranged in age from 9 to 56. A 39-year-old woman was killed, OSBI said. The injuries of those wounded were considered non-life-threatening. OSBI had earlier said two juveniles were injured in the shooting but said Sunday afternoon that only one juvenile was injured. Witnesses said an argument preceded the gunfire just after midnight, the agency said. About 1,500 people attended the event in Taft, which usually has a population of just a few hundred people. Members of the Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office were in attendance and immediately began rendering aid, OSBI said. Gov. Kevin Stitt said on Twitter that he was grateful for the OSBI’s “swift response to assist local police.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: It could be a dangerous boating and floating season on the North Santiam River. Downed trees have created one complete blockage in the river and two other major hazard points between Stayton and Jefferson. There haven’t been many incidents so far this season due to cool and wet weather, but with the river running higher than normal, warm weather approaching and potentially good fishing on the way, officials are warning boaters about the hazardous locations as the summer float season gets underway. “The amount of trees in the North Santiam has increased significantly this past year, and there are a fair number of obstructions,” said Brian Paulsen, boating safety program manager for the Oregon State Marine Board. “With high and cold water, there’s a high risk for everyone.” Many of the hazards come from numerous trees killed in the Labor Day fires that have been washed downstream and gotten trapped in certain areas of the river, particularly between Buell-Miller County Park boat ramp, Greens Bridge and Jefferson. The logs can capsize boats and sweep people into “strainers,” where strong current traps people against branches and limbs, sometimes leading to drowning. All reported obstructions statewide can be pinpointed on the Marine Board’s reported waterway obstruction dashboard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDent’s Run: A scientific analysis commissioned by the FBI shortly before agents went digging for buried treasure suggested that a huge quantity of gold could be below the surface, according to newly released government documents and photos that deepen the mystery of the 2018 excavation in remote western Pennsylvania. The report, by a geophysicist who performed microgravity testing at the site, hinted at an underground object with a mass of up to 9 tons and a density consistent with gold. The FBI used the consultant’s work to obtain a warrant to seize the gold – if there was any to be found. The government has long claimed its dig was a bust. But a father-son pair of treasure hunters who spent years hunting for the fabled Civil War-era gold – and who led agents to the woodland site, hoping for a finder’s fee – suspect the FBI double-crossed them and made off with a cache that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The newly revealed geophysical survey was part of a court-ordered release of government records on the FBI’s treasure hunt at Dent’s Run, about 135 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, where legend says an 1863 shipment of Union gold was either lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Brown University graduates Sunday to “hold on to your hope,” even when faced with darkness in the world right now. “Amid the darkness, it would be easy to descend into apathy or despair. But we can’t. We can’t,” Pelosi said at the Ivy League school in Providence. The California Democrat referenced the “senseless” shootings at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a supermarket in Buffalo, New York – as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights, the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and voter suppression. “You’re graduating into a vastly different world,” she said, congratulating the students on their bravery and resilience. Referencing President Abraham Lincoln’s efforts to unite the country during “one of America’s darkest hours,” Pelosi called on the graduates “to help summon the better angels of our nature to help heal America’s fractured soul.” Pelosi was the principal speaker for the Class of 2022 commencement ceremony and one of nine people to receive an honorary degree during the three-day commencement weekend. Recording artist Shaggy was also honored Saturday for his work as a musician and a philanthropist.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Scientists are looking for volunteers to help them study the differences in heat across short distances in the city. A sensor will be put on the car window of volunteers who will then drive certain routes to get exact temperature readings, University of South Carolina professor Kirstin Dow told WLTX-TV. Dow is part of a mapping project paid for by the National Integrated Heat Health Information System to identify and research heat islands, or small areas that are hotter than their surroundings just feet away. That data can help determine the best materials to use for buildings or ground cover or how important trees are to cooling off as temperatures are expected to get hotter. A similar mapping project was done in Charleston last summer and determined the influence of the sea breeze doesn’t extend far inland, said Scott Curtis, the director of the Near Center for Climate Studies, which helped Charleston with the study. “One of the areas that was the hottest was the port. And not because it was near the water – because there is lots of asphalt, lots of concrete, there’s just no vegetation at all,” Curtis said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 60 Indigenous students celebrated their high school graduation in a special ceremony Friday. The Sioux Falls School District has held a senior honoring ceremony specifically for Indigenous students for at least a decade, said Anna Brokenleg, instructional coach and teacher on special assignment for the Office of Indian Education for the district. A total of 90 Native American students will graduate from Sioux Falls public schools this year, Brokenleg said, counting 60 who were able to attend Friday night’s ceremony, ahead of graduation for all four public high schools Sunday. “Historically, when you look at graduation rates for Native students, they’re often very low,” Brokenleg said, explaining why it’s important to honor these students in a culturally relevant manner. “Hearing from a variety of elders and professionals allows them to see a mirror of the kinds of things they can be in life … and to have a gathering for families to be able to celebrate with them, and the hard work they’ve put in … it’s a really important thing to do.” The honoring ceremony started with an opening prayer, songs by Crazy Bull, and a presentation of the U.S. and South Dakota flags, as well as an eagle feather staff, by veterans. Three speakers gave addresses, then a group of student leaders carried in their tribal flags.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has signed off on a new campaign finance and ethics face-lift, bucking objections from some of the state’s most influential advocacy groups who opposed the measure. “I think that transparency is a good idea,” Lee told reporters earlier this month. “I think that whenever we have transparency into organizations that politically lobby, that’s a good thing.” The Republican governor signed the measure Friday. The move comes as a federal investigation has hovered over the GOP-controlled General Assembly for over a year that has so far led to one Republican lawmaker pleading guilty to a federal wire fraud charge over allegations she helped carry out a political consulting kickback scheme. However, even as the statehouse’s top legislative leaders called for campaign ethics reform amid the ongoing investigation scandals, so-called dark money groups have remained fiercely opposed to the new changes. Many argued the law will result in them disclosing donors. Opponents include Americans for Prosperity, Tennessee Right to Life and the National Rifle Association. Supporters counter that the new law will shine a light on expenditures, not donors. Specifically, certain politically active nonprofits must disclose spending totaling at least $5,000 within 60 days of an election on communications that contain a state candidate’s name or likeness. The measure also states that political committee leadership must provide identification.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A man has been sentenced to six years in prison for setting fire to the Travis County Democratic Party office in downtown Austin. Federal court records showed Ryan Faircloth, 31, of San Antonio, was sentenced Friday to 72 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to arson for throwing a Molotov cocktail into the office in September. An attorney for Faircloth did not immediately return a phone call for comment Saturday. Faircloth, who was arrested days after the attack, had faced up to 20 years in prison before reaching a plea agreement in the case. No one was in the office when it was attacked about 2 a.m. Only a small stack of papers caught fire, officials have said, and the blaze was quickly extinguished by employees of a neighboring business.\n\nUtah\n\nSyracuse: Ninth graders at Syracuse Arts Academy asked a science teacher whose gender transition they witnessed to be their graduation speaker. Bree Borrowman began transitioning two years ago, when the students were seventh graders, and they supported her at every step in her journey, she said. So she was especially touched when student body officers asked her to be the one to send them off on their own new journey. As as far as she can tell, she may be the first transgender person ever to speak at a graduation event in Utah, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Each one of you is absolutely brilliant, beautiful and wonderful,” Borrowman told the group of 132 ninth graders at the public charter school. “However, feelings of shame and guilt from outside influences can often make us feel less than and unloved. … You are not alone. I love you. And my door is always open.” Parents, administrators and former students waited in a group around Borrowman after the ceremony to thank her for her speech. Some said it made them think of how they can be more supportive of their family members and friends who are LGBTQ. Borrowman, 65, grew up in Bountiful and has lived in Utah nearly all of her life.\n\nVermont\n\nWeybridge: The remains of a Revolutionary War soldier are being moved to a resting place elsewhere in the state because erosion threatens some of the graves at an old cemetery near a riverbank. Josiah Clark, who fought in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill in Massachusetts, was buried in the Stow cemetery in Weybridge in 1835. Erosion over the years left his grave perched on the edge of a steep eroding bank, so his bones were exhumed in 2019. This month a horse-drawn wagon carried a flag-draped coffin containing Clark from the congregational church to another cemetery nearby for a reinterment ceremony. The rest of the roughly 20 graves will also be moved to the Old Weybridge Hill Cemetery eventually, including the remains of Revolutionary War soldier William Haven.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Legislative leaders are proposing a new criminal misdemeanor in state law for possession of more than 4 ounces of marijuana in public. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the proposal is included in a new two-year state budget plan, which became publicly available online Sunday evening. The General Assembly will meet Wednesday in special session to consider the budget. The language on marijuana – like much of the budget agreement – followed discussions that were not held in public. The budget compromise backed by House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight, a Republican, and Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Janet Howell, a Democrat, would write into law that anyone caught in public with more than 4 ounces of marijuana would be guilty of a Class 3 criminal misdemeanor that carries a fine of up to $500, plus a criminal record. A second or subsequent offense would be a Class 2 misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000. Chelsea Higgs Wise, executive director of the group Marijuana Justice Virginia, along with heads of other organizations, blasted the proposal in an email sent to Howell on Sunday evening. “Please stop finding more ways to criminalize Virginians,” she wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s appointments to an obscure regulatory panel have cost the state $70,000 in a public records lawsuit settlement and forced the governor to name new appointees. The dispute centered on Inslee’s handling of appointments to the Washington State Building Code Council, which establishes minimum standards for new construction, including rules for energy efficiency, plumbing and fire safety, The Seattle Times reports. State law says two of the council’s 15 members must be nominated by trade associations representing residential and commercial builders. But Inslee last year ignored builder group recommendations and instead named two of his own picks. The Building Industry Association of Washington and the Associated General Contractors of Washington sued over the appointments and filed another lawsuit saying the governor’s office failed to turn over relevant documents after a public records request. The state later admitted that a member of Inslee’s staff had made a material false statement in a sworn court declaration by saying one of Inslee’s nominees had been put forward by another building trade group, when he had not.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: After more than a half-century of carrying visitors on scenic round-trip journeys to the depths of two river gorges, the aerial tramways serving Hawks Nest and Pipestem Resort state parks soon will be replaced. West Virginia State Parks officials are hopeful new, improved aerial tramways will be operating at the two parks next year. The Hawks Nest aerial tramway has been closed since June 6, when a routine morning inspection by the state park’s staff turned up a safety issue that required substantial remediation. “Since then, we’ve shuttled 7,600 people down to the marina to ride the jet boat,” said Joe Baughman, the park’s superintendent. The shuttle involves a van trip from Hawks Nest’s lodge to Ansted, about a mile to the east, followed by a 4-mile descent to Hawks Nest Lake on Mill Creek Road. The Hawks Nest tramway, which opened in 1970, typically carries more than 45,000 visitors annually on steep, 800-foot descents from the lodge to a marina on Hawks Nest Lake at the base of the New River Gorge. The aerial tramway at Pipestem, which began operating in 1972, carries visitors nearly two-thirds of a mile, descending from the rim of Bluestone Canyon and crossing the Bluestone River before arriving at Mountain Creek Lodge. The trip involves an 1,100-foot drop in elevation and six minutes of sightseeing time.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: When Wisconsin Republicans asked the public to report concerns about the 2020 election, voters flocked to the web to submit tips – often about the very officials conducting the probe. “There is a very disturbed man ranting like a lunatic and telling provable lies about the election in order to undermine election integrity,” one person wrote in April. “Not only that, he’s stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from taxpayers by pretending to do a legitimate investigation. This is fraud at the highest levels and he literally advocated nullifying the votes of Wisconsin. Please stop this flagrant fraud asap.” The submission was similar to dozens of others filed over the past year that taunt Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester and former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman for budgeting $676,000 for a review of a presidential election that recounts, court decisions and independent studies have concluded was properly called for President Joe Biden. Few submissions contained concrete tips about the way the election was run. Some were vague. Others were unhinged. The messages were submitted over the past year to a wifraud.com, a website set up by Gableman. He recently shut down the site but continues to maintain two others, wielectionreview.org and wispecialcounsel.org.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Organizers of a planned abortion clinic say they won’t be deterred by last week’s potential arson. When they settled on a summer opening for the women’s health clinic earlier this year, they felt upbeat about their plans even as they knew they would face opposition to what will be the only such clinic to offer abortions in the state. There were the expected protests and harassing messages. Things got more tense after a leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that, if finalized, would likely make abortions illegal in Wyoming and half of the states. Then last week, their building was damaged by a fire police believe was deliberately set. None of it has derailed plans to open the clinic – a rarity in heavily Republican parts of the United States where most abortion providers at the moment are fighting just to stay in business, let alone expand services. “We can’t be bullied into submission,” Julie Burkhart, the clinic founder, said as she watched from across the street as Casper police and firefighters investigated the blaze.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/04/fur-seal-pups-big-balloon-fest-runaway-bull-news-around-states/40242775/", "title": "Fur seal pups, big balloon fest, runaway bull: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Gov. Kay Ivey said South Korean auto parts manufacturer Shinhwa Group is investing $42 million in a facility and will create 95 jobs in Auburn, the company’s first manufacturing facility in the United States. Construction is already underway. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be finished by the summer. Shinhwa will initially make driveshafts for vehicles built by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing’s plant in Montgomery, as well as for Kia Motor Manufacturing’s plant, just across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Alabama Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said the company is a “welcome addition” to the state’s network of “high-caliber auto suppliers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern fur seals have declined at the world’s largest rookery in Alaska’s Pribilof Islands, but they’re thriving at an unlikely location. Numbers of fur seals continue to grow on Bogoslof Island, a tiny landmass at the tip of an active undersea volcano in the Aleutian Islands. The volcano two years ago spewed ash into the path of jetliners. Hot mud, steam and sulfurous gases continue to spit up from vents on the island. Fur seals give birth and raise pups along the beach of the island that’s only about one-third the size of New York City’s Central Park. Tom Gelatt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said biologists in 2015 estimated there were 28,000 pups on the island. He said the 2019 estimate likely will be more than 36,000 pups.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Game and Fish Department is investigating the poaching of a bull elk north of Heber in late August and is asking for the public’s help finding whoever killed the animal. The agency said Tuesday the poacher left the bull elk’s meat to waste west of Forest Road 153 near Point and Javelina water catchments. Agency officials said in a press release they believe someone has information about the case because the poaching incident occurred during a time when many hunters were scouting the area for upcoming hunts. Other recreationists are also believed to have been in the area at the time of the crime, the agency said. Hunting elk and other types of game in Arizona is regulated by the department. Hunters are required to draw permits, which are limited in number and allow them to hunt a limited number of game. Hunting can take place only in designated areas during designated periods. Most elk hunting takes place during the fall season in Arizona, although there are a few locations designated during other times of the year, according to the Game and Fish website. Anyone with information about the poaching incident should call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline at 800-352-0700 or visit www.azgfd.gov and refer to case #19-003199. Callers can remain anonymous upon request and might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 upon an arrest. The Arizona Elk Society and Arizona Deer Association are each offering an additional $2,500 reward upon the arrest and conviction of the poachers, according to a press release from the department.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The Saracen Casino Annex, the largest tourism investment project in Arkansas, opened Tuesday morning. The annex is part of the $350 million Saracen Casino Resort project owned and operated by the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation. The casino resort is expected to open next June. About 10,000 guests have visited the 300-slot-machine annex since Friday’s surprise “soft opening.” Quapaw Nation officials said they plan to employ 1,100 people permanently at the Saracen Casino Resort. More than 200 are employed at the annex and a new nearby convenience store and gas station. Most hires came from Pine Bluff. The project is expected to feature 2,000 slot machines and 50 gambling tables, along with a 300-room hotel with a fire safety and an emergency services facility.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents had a chance to see a mini-air show as the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team tours California. The team flew past the famed Hollywood sign Wednesday afternoon and headed south to the Port of Long Beach to fly over the retired British ocean liner Queen Mary, which is now a tourist attraction and hotel. On Tuesday, the Red Arrows’ jets flew over San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate bridge. This weekend, they will join the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds and other performers at the Great Pacific Airshow over the surf at Huntington Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A falcon that has served as the mascot for the U.S. Air Force Academy for the past 23 years has died. KCNC-TV reported the passing of the falcon named Aurora was announced by the academy on Wednesday. The academy said in a statement that the falcon was the longest-serving live mascot in the school’s 65-year history. Aurora was reported to have recovered after suffering injuries to its wings in November 2018 during a prank abduction before the annual football game against the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. The Air Force Academy uses several falcons during home games and Aurora attended most road games to greet fans. The academy described her as a “feisty, spirited bird who commanded respect.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nGroton: The Pentagon said the USS Oregon, the Navy’s newest attack submarine, will be christened Saturday at General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton. U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, said he will attend as the keynote speaker. He said the submarine will be christened with water from Crater Lake and wine from Oregon. Oregon, a Virginia-class submarine, is the third U.S. Navy ship to honor the state. Virginia-class submarines are built to conduct anti-submarine warfare; anti-surface ship warfare; strike warfare; special operation forces support; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; irregular warfare; and mine warfare missions. The Pentagon said they have stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island:State environmental officials might soon lease public parkland to an offshore wind energy company in exchange for millions of dollars in new amenities at Delaware’s southernmost beach. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has signed an initial memorandum of understanding with Ørsted, an offshore wind company based in Denmark, to discuss leasing up to 1.5 acres at Fenwick Island State Park. Ørsted would use park property to build an interconnection facility that will connect power generated by the yet-to-be-built Skipjack Wind Farm to the electrical grid. In exchange for leasing the public land, the company would fund improvements at the park, with the state now suggesting more than a dozen projects worth upward of $18 million. Those projects could include a two-level parking garage, a pedestrian overpass that allows foot traffic to cross Coastal Highway from the ocean side to the bayside, connections for a trail or sidewalk system, two additional bathrooms, an amphitheater and a new local Chamber of Commerce building that would house the park’s visitors center, a small nature center and more.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A museum dedicated to journalism and the First Amendment is set to close its doors near the National Mall by the end of the year. WTOP-FM reported the Newseum announced its impending closure Tuesday, citing yearslong financial issues. A company statement said that despite more than 11 years of service and nearly 10 million visitors, continued operations have proved to be unsustainable. The statement said the museum’s founder and primary funder, the Freedom Forum, remains committed to its mission to champion the five freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment. It said efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of a free press are needed now more than ever. Visitors are welcome through Dec. 31. Tickets purchased online include a 15% discount, with prices now starting at about $12.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan said Wednesday that he will be the majority investor in the nation’s only 24-hour news network aimed at African American viewers, giving the network a deep pocket as it launches next month. The network has been in the works for years and an announcement about its launch was made earlier this year. But Khan’s backing gives it a substantial boost. He declined to say how much he would invest initially but said it would be enough to keep the network running for a long time. Khan is worth an estimated $8 billion and made his fortune in the auto equipment industry. As well as the Jaguars, he owns Fulham Football Club of the English Football League, Four Seasons Hotel Toronto and All Elite Wrestling. Former Republican U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, who was a star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma in the 1980s, will be chairman of the new network. It will be available via cable and satellite viewers in 33 million households. The network has agreements with Charter Communications, Comcast and DISH and will be carried in major African American markets such as New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago and Los Angeles. The network is to begin broadcasting in November and will be based in Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, with bureaus across the country, Watts said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAdel: A hospital and nursing home in south Georgia has moved into a new $40 million facility. The Adel hospital began operating from its new home Tuesday. What had previously been Cook Medical Center is now called Southwell Medical. The 20-bed hospital, 95-bed nursing home and physicians’ offices are operated by Tift Regional Health System. Tift Regional Health System President Christopher Dorman told WALB-TV that the new complex just off Interstate 75 was renamed to help attract patients from beyond Cook County. The new hospital doesn’t have an emergency room but does have a walk-in clinic. The health system borrowed about 70% of construction costs through a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development loan. Cook County and Adel government agencies provided the remainder. The old hospital’s new use remains undetermined.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A post-mortem examination of two pygmy killer whales that were found stranded on a Maui beach suggested they were fighting an infection. The Maui News reported Wednesday that the adult males had inflamed lymph nodes when they stranded themselves at Sugar Beach last month. The infection was also found in pygmy killer whales that stranded themselves at the same beach in August. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the whales were afflicted elsewhere and there is no indication of an environmental toxin at Sugar Beach. The animals were euthanized after tests indicated little chance for survival at sea. Researchers said unusual food items, including excess plant material found in the animals, indicate they were not feeding normally.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge said she agrees that fulfilling public records requests can put a big burden on governmental resources, but she expressed skepticism about the number of completely redacted pages provided to four Boise-area journalists by Ada County officials this year. Fourth District Judge Deborah Bail made the comments during a hearing on a lawsuit between the Idaho Press Club and Ada County Commissioners on Wednesday afternoon. In the lawsuit the Idaho Press Club and the four journalists contend county officials repeatedly violated the state’s Public Records Act by wrongly denying access to some documents, over-redacting others and otherwise mishandling public information requests. In court Wednesday, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney James Dickinson said the judge has all the evidence she needs in the form of the unredacted documents. Dickinson said some of the redacted documents require context to understand why they should be kept from release but said he can’t discuss it in open court lest he reveal private protected information.\n\nIllinois\n\nFairview Heights: Planned Parenthood has quietly been building a new abortion clinic in Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, as women concerned about the uncertain future of Missouri’s sole abortion clinic flock across the state line. The 18,000-square-foot in Fairview Heights, 12 miles east of St. Louis, will provide abortion services, as well as family planning, when it opens in mid-October, Planned Parenthood officials said at a news conference Wednesday. Planned Parenthood has been fighting Missouri’s health department for months to try and keep open its St. Louis clinic. The state has refused to renew its license to perform abortions, citing concerns that include “failed abortions” that required additional surgeries. Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission is deciding the fate of the St. Louis clinic. During an annual inspection of the St. Louis clinic in March, Missouri health investigators cited numerous concerns, including reports of failed abortions. Planned Parenthood said it has already addressed those concerns and defended its clinic. It claims the state is using the licensing process as an excuse to stop abortions.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: More than 2,200 sets of preserved fetal remains found in the Illinois garage of a late Indiana abortion doctor have been returned to Indiana. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill said Thursday that the fetal remains found last month at Dr. Ulrich Klopfer’s Will County, Illinois, home were transferred Wednesday to the St. Joseph County coroner’s office for “safekeeping.” Hill said at a news conference in South Bend that investigators determined the remains came from abortions performed in Indiana in 2000, 2001 and 2002. Authorities are still investigating where the abortions occurred. Klopfer performed abortions at clinics in Fort Wayne, South Bend and Gary. Relatives cleaning out Klopfer’s garage after his Sept. 3 death found the remains. Hill said they will be “given the decency of a burial that they deserve.”\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said it plans to collect as many deer samples in northeastern Iowa as it can this hunting season to test for chronic wasting disease after the first case in Dubuque County was confirmed in January, the Telegraph Herald reported Thursday. Chris Ensminger, the wildlife research section supervisor for the department, said officials want to collect at least 250 samples from an area in which the diseased deer was killed and at least 250 samples from elsewhere in Dubuque County. Samples also will be collected from surrounding eastern Iowa counties. The disease attacks the brains of deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have been recorded, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to not eat meat from infected animals. The disease has become increasingly prevalent in parts of the Midwest, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Nearly 400 of the 1,060 deer that tested positive for the disease in Wisconsin from April 2018 to the end of March were in Iowa County in southwest Wisconsin. Other cases came from surrounding Crawford, Grant and Lafayette counties.\n\nKansas\n\nLinwood: A plan to build a village of foster care homes in northeast Kansas has gotten the OK, although the project has been scaled down. The Kansas City Star reported that the nonprofit Joy Meadows initially sought to create a development with up to 10 homes that could house large sibling sets on a 23-acre property in the Linwood area. Instead, the Leavenworth County Commission voted Wednesday to limit the first phase of development to four total homes, including one that is located there. The nonprofit would be allowed to add three more in a future phase, upon review from the county. Foster care advocates and the Kansas Department for Children and Families voiced support for the residential development. But the project faced opposition from neighbors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLudlow:Fire and police units are at the scene of a barge accident that set several boats adrift or sinking in the Ohio River. The barge hit the Ludlow Bromley Yacht Club on Wednesday morning hard enough to partially submerge the marina’s bar and grill. Steve Hensley, Kenton County’s Director of Homeland Security and Management, told news outlets six boats were knocked loose. Hensley said there was one person on the barge and one person on one of the boats, but neither was injured. Officials said the restaurant and patio of the yacht club were heavily damaged with some of it attached to the barge that struck it. Ludlow Police Chief Scott Smith said the Coast Guard is investigating and the barge operator was being questioned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGonzales: The federal government has bought out an entire flood-prone neighborhood in Louisiana, prompting all its residents to move to higher ground. News outlets reported the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Emergency Watershed Protection Program financed the buyouts on along Silverleaf Street in Gonzales, which was carved out of a wetland in the 1980s and has frequently flooded since. Chief city engineer Jackie Baumann said the federal agency is buying the homes at preflood market value, and Restore Louisiana is offering to make up shortfalls in the purchasing price for some residents, as long as their next home isn’t in a flood zone. The 2017 offer required all 41 residents to agree to the deal, and the last resident agreed last month, enabling the government to restore the wetland.\n\nMaine\n\nLubec: American fishermen are expected to get a little more fishing quota under terms of an agreement with Canada. The countries are home to fisheries for economically important species that cross international boundaries, such as cod and haddock. They reach an agreement every year about how to divide catch on eastern Georges Bank, a crucial fishing area off New England and Canada. The New England Fishery Management Council said the U.S is scheduled to get 29% of the 1.4 million-pound total allowable catch of cod on eastern Georges Bank in 2020. It’s also set for 54% of the 66 million-pound total allowable catch of haddock in the area. The figures are subject to federal approval. They represent a 2.6 million-pound bump for haddock and about the same figure for cod compared to 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A 1,600-pound bull escaped from a truck into the streets of Baltimore for several hours. The Baltimore Sun reported that it took three tranquilizer shots and a crew of zoo officials to recapture the animal on Wednesday. The purebred Angus breeding bull broke out of a truck while it was stopped at a red light. A crowd gathered and watched as the animal was corralled. Baltimore Police spokeswoman Det. Nicole Monroe told the newspaper that the “owner of the bull said he doesn’t have the best disposition.” The bull was from Hedgeapple Farm in Buckeystown. Executive director Scott Barao said the animal was very expensive and thanked the police for not shooting it. He said the bull is “extremely valuable to us and we’re just glad to have him alive.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: State wildlife officials said a moose that was struck by two cars and had a broken leg has been euthanized. Marion Larson, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, told The Boston Globe that Worcester police were called about a bull moose that was hit by a car Monday morning and Monday night. The moose was spotted in a pond Tuesday morning, and the state Environmental Police responded to the scene. Several boats were deployed so the moose did not approach Interstate 290, and to maneuver the animal into a suitable darting area. Larson said the 3 ½-year-old moose would not have survived its injuries. Another moose spotted in a Worcester cemetery Monday was tranquilized and freed at a state park.\n\nMichigan\n\nBattle Creek:A fourth Michigan resident has died from a rare mosquito-borne virus that has been recorded across the southern half of the state. WWMT-TV reported that 79-year-old Stan Zalner of Battle Creek died Wednesday after contracting eastern equine encephalitis. Ronna Bagent told the television station that her father was hospitalized in September with severe flu-like symptoms before doctors were able to confirm the illness through blood tests. Nine cases have been confirmed in six southern or southwestern Michigan counties. More than 30 animals – including 18 horses – in more than a dozen counties also have died from the disease. State health officials say low-flying aircraft were expected to spray pesticides Wednesday in Calhoun and 10 other counties. The pesticides kill adult mosquitoes on contact.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has rejected challenges by several environmental groups to a land swap needed for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen dismissed the four lawsuits late Monday, ruling that the groups lacked the necessary legal standing to block the land exchange between PolyMet and the federal government. She said the groups couldn’t establish that they had been harmed. PolyMet traded 6,650 acres of federal land in the Superior National Forest at the mine site near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes for a similar amount of private land last year. Several environmental groups sued to challenge various aspects of the deal, saying it undervalued the federal land and violated other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. PolyMet disputed those claims and persuaded the judge to dismiss the lawsuits. Ericksen dismissed the lawsuits without prejudice, meaning the groups could refile them at some later point. They could also appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:At least 22 soldiers training at Champ Shelby were injured during a night parachuting exercise. U.S. Army spokesman John Pennell told WDAM-TV that at least 15 people were treated by medics and another seven were hospitalized. Staff Sgt. John Healy said none of the injuries is considered to be life-threatening. Camp Shelby Cmdr. Col. Bobby Ginn said the troopers belong to the 4th Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. Pennell said about 89 paratroopers were on the plane for the Wednesday night exercise. Ginn said the soldiers jumped from a C-130 aircraft and were blown off-course from their intended landing zone and into a group of pine trees. Several were entangled in the trees and had to be rescued. Healy says about 650 soldiers were involved in the exercise. About 3,000 troops from the Alaska base are at monthlong training at Camp Shelby called “Operation Arctic Anvil.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A compromise has been reached after Kansas City-area defense attorneys complained that their underwire bras were setting off jail metal detectors, forcing them to remove their lingerie for screening if they wanted to meet with their clients face-to-face. KCUR reported that the solution reached last month allows attorneys who set off metal detectors at the Jackson County Jail to be wanded or patted down. Attorneys protested after the jail rolled out a new security protocol in May. Jail officials initially responded by offering to allow attorneys to have noncontact visits, in which they talked to their clients by phones separated by glass, without clearing metal detectors first. But attorneys continued to push for change. Attorney Tracy Spradlin said she is thankful the issue was resolved without a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has announced plans to build a larger veterans affairs clinic in Missoula. The Missoulian reported that Tester, Democrat, announced Tuesday a location was chosen for a new community-based outpatient clinic. Officials said the clinic will be three times larger than the current clinic, which serves more than 6,000 veterans. It will have expanded primary care, mental health and specialty services. Tester said the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act that passed in 2017 set aside about $7 million in federal funding for the project. The clinic is expected to open in 2022. The current clinic will continue to serve patients until the new clinic opens.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A bobcat that wandered into a Lincoln building has been captured and released back into the wild. Staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs campus in south Lincoln called the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission on Tuesday to report the animal had been spotted inside one of its buildings. Commission staffers set a cage trap and baited it with raw fish. The estimated 20-pound bobcat bit on the bait and was caught. It was freed outside of town Wednesday. Bobcats are common in Nebraska and can be found at the edge of Lincoln, sometimes coming inside to hunt. Sam Wilson with the commission said bobcats are common but rarely seen.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A firefighter suffered burns and a woman was hospitalized after she jumped from a second-floor window at a motel that was on fire just east of downtown Reno. Police closed part of East Fourth Street for about three hours Tuesday afternoon before firefighters knocked down the blaze at the Lucky Motel. Fire officials told KRNV-TV the blaze destroyed two units at the weekly motel. One firefighter was being treated for burns to his leg. The woman was transported to a local hospital after she jumped from the window onto a car. She also suffered smoke inhalation. There was no immediate information available on their conditions Wednesday. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Reno Fire Department chaplain and motel owner were working to relocate displaced residents to a nearby motel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: A young moose that got stuck in a swimming pool has been successfully coaxed out. New Hampshire Fish and Game Department biologists and conservation officers were called to a Bedford home Tuesday to help remove the young bull. He was in the water for several hours. Officers said he was unable to get himself out of the pool, so they put in a set of wooden steps. The department posted a video of the moose looking back and forth as the team held a rope and coaxed him out. He scampered away. Col. Kevin Jordan suggested it had to do with it being moose breeding season. He told television station WMUR that “the younger moose will wander long distances struggling to find a female.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nForked River: The state has created an oversight panel to evaluate the process of dismantling the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant. Gov. Phil Murphy said it will ensure the “proper protocols” are in place throughout the process. Oyster Creek is being decommissioned after it was permanently shuttered in September 2018. Its spent fuel is also being put into safe storage. The panel’s formation was announced Wednesday. It plans to meet at least twice a year and will allow the public to share their concerns. Its members include the state’s Environmental Protection Commissioner, state police superintendent, homeland security director and the president of the Board of Public Utilities. Oyster Creek is located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia. It produced enough electricity each year to supply about 600,000 typical homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons will lift off from the New Mexico desert over nine days as part of one of the world’s largest festivals dedicated to the sport of ballooning. In its 48th year, the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is scheduled to kick off Saturday with a mass ascension. More than 580 balloons are registered, 17 countries are represented and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world are expected to turn out for the opening weekend. Albuquerque has played host to the fiesta since its inception in 1972. Troy Bradley, one of the ballooning world’s most prolific record-setters, said, “There’s just nothing like it in the world, to see that much color going into the sky.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Homeowners hurt by record flooding along Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River have until the end of this month to seek state funding. People living in Cayuga, Jefferson, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Oswego, St. Lawrence and Wayne counties can apply for up to $50,000 to offset damages sustained this year to their primary residences. The window for applications opened Tuesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office said $20 million is available through the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Flood Relief and Recovery Program.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville:State health officials said 116 people have been diagnosed with Legionnaire’s disease since an outbreak was reported in September. The Asheville Citizen Times reported the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released the figures Wednesday, adding that there was one death. The department also said 65% of those diagnosed had to be hospitalized. DHHS expected the number of confirmed cases to continue to climb as diagnostic tests are processed. Health officials aren’t sure if the illness originated from last month’s Mountain State Fair. Legionnaires’ disease is bacterial pneumonia that develops when someone breathes in mist or water that contains the bacteria into their lungs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill has released produced water into a small creek and a stock pond in western North Dakota. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the spill, which happened Tuesday in Dunn County. The pipeline is part of a gathering system operated by Marathon Oil. The spill happened about 1.5 miles northeast of Manning. Authorities don’t know what caused the leak. An estimated 21,000 gallons of produced water were released, impacting the creek and stock pond within pastureland. The creek discharges into the Knife River, but no impacts have been detected in the river. Produced water is a by-product of oil and gas development. State inspectors are checking the site and will continue to monitor the investigation and remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: An investigation into alleged hazing by a fraternity at Miami University has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members. A student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation. The student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported Oxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury’s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing. Miami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school’s Code of Student Conduct. Delta Tau Delta’s national headquarters revoked the chapter’s charter in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some of the 44 death row inmates housed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester will soon be moved from the prison’s maximum-security H-Unit to another unit to give them more benefits and access to the outdoors, the state’s new prisons boss said. In a letter released by the agency on Thursday, the Department of Corrections’ Interim Executive Director Scott Crow told officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma that the agency plans to move “qualifying inmates” to its less restrictive A-Unit by the end of October. The ACLU had threatened legal action over what it said are potential constitutional violations of the rights of death row inmates, mostly by confining them to their cells for 23 hours per day. Crow said the agency also plans to begin “contact” visitation for some of the moved death row inmates, who are allowed only noncontact visits behind Plexiglas and over a telephone.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The City Council has agreed to discuss whether to impose a ban on feeding deer and elk that wander city streets. KTVZ-TV reported councilmember Chris Piper, who with Bruce Abernethy proposed considering such a ban Wednesday, said the plans were brought to him and other councilmembers by neighborhood associations. Piper said dozens of collisions involving vehicles and deer were reported in the city last year. Piper said cities including Sunriver and Sisters have seen positive results from similar wildlife feeding regulations. There is a similar ban on feeding geese in Bend that can result in a $372 fine. Although that ban is isolated to Mirror Pond, the potential deer and elk feeding ban would be citywide.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Another alligator has turned up in Pittsburgh, the seventh this year. George DeSavage told WTAE-TV he and his girlfriend spotted it along the Allegheny River as the sun was setting on Tuesday. He said he grabbed it and it “went kind of limp and calm.” He said it seemed like it was handled by somebody. Police took it to Humane Animal Rescue, which named the gator Gus. The shelter shared photos on its Facebook page. The shelter believes the reptile was a pet. It’s not illegal to own an alligator in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s high school students scored significantly lower on the SAT than the national averages. The Providence Journal reported Thursday that the state’s Class of 2019 scored an average of 483 points on the English portion of the standardized college entrance exam; the national average was 531. On the math section of the test, Rhode Islanders scored an average of 474; the national average was 528. The numbers also showed a gap between white students and students of color, with white students scoring about 70 points higher in English and math. The Rhode Island Department of Education said SAT scores were flat statewide. State Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on district leaders to develop action plans to increase test participation and overall scores.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A man who set a fire at a Walmart to divert attention as he stole a case of beer has been sentenced to the maximum of 15 years in prison. Solicitor David Stumbo said 34-year-old Russell Geddings pleaded guilty Tuesday to third-degree arson – the same day his trial was set to start. Stumbo said Geddings set a clothes rack on fire at a Greenwood Walmart on Dec. 5 then stole the beer in the chaos. Stumbo said in a statement no one was injured, but $1.2 million worth of damage was done to the store and merchandise. Stumbo said Geddings deserved the maximum sentence for putting so many people at risk to steal beer. Geddings’ attorneys did not answer an email from a reporter seeking comment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A Delta commercial airplane made an emergency landing in Sioux Falls on Thursday morning for a passenger who had a medical emergency, officials said. The Delta flight, scheduled around 7:30 a.m. from Chicago to Seattle, was diverted when a 63-year-old male passenger started to experience emergency medical symptoms, said Dan Letellier, executive director for the Sioux Falls Regional Airport. The flight was over Pierre when its pilots diverted to Sioux Falls, he said. The airplane landed around 8:30 a.m. and the passenger was transported to a local hospital, Letellier said. The passenger was alert and conscious, but Letellier didn’t comment any further on the man’s condition. “Based on our location in the country, there are thousands of flights that go overhead each year,” Letellier said. “We get at least one or two medical diversions a month. It’s a matter of where we fit in the country.”\n\nTennessee\n\nCollierville:Dozens gathered Tuesday to welcome home fallen soldier Maj. Trevor Joseph. The 33-year-old died Sept. 26 in an aviation accident at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He is survived by his wife, Erin. “Trevor was the greatest individual who was truly just so humble,” family members said in a text. “He would be so embarrassed by all this heroic attention, but this is exactly what he deserves.” Funeral arrangements are pending. Joseph, a soldier from the Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk’s 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment, was killed during a JRTC rotation in a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter within the training area, according to a Facebook post from JRTC and Fort Polk. Three other 1st Battalion, 5th Aviation Regiment soldiers were injured. The cause of the accident is under investigation.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A truck driver from California was killed Wednesday when his semi crashed into an overpass support column on Interstate 10 in downtown El Paso. The fatal crash closed westbound lanes for several hours Wednesday morning. Harjot Singh Goraya, 32, of Riverside, California, was driving when he veered off the road and crashed into a support column shortly before 1 a.m. by the Mesa Street exit ramp. Traffic Police said that the road was wet from an earlier rainstorm but that the Special Traffic Investigations Unit has yet to determine how the driver lost control. The crash closed all westbound lanes early Wednesday. Drivers were urged to find alternative routes into downtown or West El Paso, including Paisano Drive, Montana Avenue and Trans Mountain Road. Traffic was directed off the highway at the downtown exit, police said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Health has confirmed the state’s first human death from West Nile virus this yer. Authorities said Saturday that a central Utah resident at least 65 years old died from the disease carried by mosquitoes sometime between Sept. 21 and Sept. 28. Information about the victim including name and gender have not been released. Utah health officials have confirmed 19 human cases West Nile virus this year. The total is higher than last year, when 11 residents contracted the virus and one person died. State health officials have said a wet spring this year created more standing water habitats for mosquitoes, attracting species that can transmit West Nile virus to Utah. Symptoms include headaches, joint pains and a high fever.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Residents of a town along the route of the Appalachian Trail have taken the first steps toward filing an application to become a designated Appalachian Trail Community. Local and county officials in Bennington met with state counterparts and community organizers recently to discuss plans to apply for the designation. Officials said the label as an Appalachian Trail Community will bring greater publicity and boost local business. The Appalachian Trail stretches about 2,200 miles, through 14 states and 40 communities. More than 100 miles of the trail runs through Vermont and a portion of it is just east of Bennington. The Bennington Banner reported that in addition to publicity, the move could bring stakeholders together to improve the trail system locally for hikers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A popular nature center will soon be closing temporarily for a $2.3 million renovation. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Maymont’s Robins Nature & Visitor Center will close Nov. 1 and open in March. The center houses fish, turtles, otters and other animals found within the James River and Chesapeake Bay. It attracts roughly 45,000 people each year. The animals will have upgraded habitats with lighting and heating systems and will be more visible to guests when the center reopens.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A late cold snap last winter has cut the production of Washington apricots in half. The Washington State Fruit Commission said the state usually produces 5,000 tons of apricots a year. But The Spokesman-Review reported that the yield this year is only about 2,500 tons. Washington produces about 20% of the nation’s apricots. The commission said frost in February, when apricot trees had bloomed, hurt production. Apricots produced in Washington are shipped across the country.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal officials said drought conditions in West Virginia are worsening as unusually high heat continues to beat down on the region. The U.S. Drought Monitor map released Thursday showed large swaths of southern West Virginia in a severe drought, a designation that includes the likely loss of crops and water shortages. The map also classified the entire northern part of the state as abnormally dry. Officials said nearly 50% of the state’s population is now in a drought. The National Weather Service marked last month as one of warmest and driest Septembers on record in multiple West Virginia cities. Less than 1 inch of rain was recorded in the month. Temperatures measured on Oct. 1 also surpassed record highs for the month in five cities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said during a stop in Wisconsin that he doesn’t know if the family dairy farm can survive as the industry moves toward a factory farm model. Perdue told reporters Tuesday following an appearance at the World Dairy Expo that it’s getting harder for farmers to get by on milking smaller herds. Perdue’s visit comes as Wisconsin dairy farmers are wrestling with a host of problems, including declining milk prices, rising suicide rates, the transition to larger farms with hundreds or thousands of animals and international trade wars. Wisconsin, which touts itself as America’s Dairyland on its license plates, has lost 551 dairy farms in 2019 after losing 638 in 2018 and 465 in 2017, according to data from the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The Legislature’s finance committee voted unanimously last month to spend an additional $200,000 to help struggling farmers deal with depression and mental health problems.\n\nWyoming", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/04"}]}

He has accused Benavides of orchestrating what he called a new form of “coup d’état” against him through her office’s investigations.\n\nIn October, Benavides filed a constitutional complaint against Castillo based on three of the six investigations her office had opened.

These include prosecutors’ allegation that he led a “criminal network” that interfered with public institutions such as the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Housing and Peru’s state-run oil company to control public bidding processes and benefit specific companies and close allies.\n\nProsecutors are also investigating whether the former President led efforts to peddle influence in the process of promoting officers in both the armed forces and national police.\n\nThese investigations also look into Castillo’s family, including his wife and sister-in-law. Former first lady Lilia Paredes is being investigated on suspicion of allegedly coordinating the criminal network.

Marriage bill\n\nThe House is expected to vote and pass legislation today that would protect same-sex and interracial marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act, which the Senate passed last week in a bipartisan vote, needs to be approved by the House before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. In a sign of how much support has grown in recent years for same-sex marriage, the bill found backing from 12 Republican senators last week, including those in deeply red states.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is “going to take a while,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday as he warned of the “increasing” threat of nuclear war. Putin said he viewed the Russian nuclear arsenal as a deterrent rather than a provocation – but has not dismissed the idea of using nuclear weapons outright. “We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are,” Putin said. “We have these means… but we are not going to brandish these weapons like a razor, running around the world.” His comments come as the Biden administration is weighing Ukrainian requests for access to the US stockpile of controversial cluster munitions. These types of scatter weapons are imprecise by design and are banned by more than 100 countries. Still, Russia is using them to devastating effect inside Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Mud, blood, trenches': Ukrainian soldier compares Bakhmut battle to World Wars 03:21 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Power grid attacks\n\nElectricity for thousands of residents in North Carolina has been restored after a dayslong outage caused by targeted gun attacks on power substations. Police say the motive behind the attacks in Moore County remains unknown and no suspects have been announced. However, investigators are zeroing in on two possible threads centered around extremist behavior: writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure, and a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ events across the nation by domestic extremists. Approximately 45,000 homes and businesses initially lost power when the outages occurred on Saturday, leaving residents without heat, running refrigerators or traffic lights for about four days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police find new evidence in North Carolina power grid attack 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration has appealed a federal court decision that blocked the use of Title 42 – a controversial Trump-era policy allowing for the swift removal of migrants at the US-Mexico border. The authority has been heavily criticized by public health experts and immigrant advocates, and has largely barred asylum at the US-Mexico border. While its origins were in the Trump administration, Title 42 has become a key tool for the Biden administration as it faces mass migration in the Western hemisphere. Officials have been bracing for an influx of migrants when the authority lifts on December 21. The Department of Homeland Security is projecting up to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border per day when the policy is lifted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visits US-Mexico border where migrants wait to cross into US 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations are on the rise in the US, with more than 34,000 new admissions last week – but millions of vaccine doses and antiviral treatments remain unused. The federal government has spent more than $30 billion so far on Covid-19 vaccines and the Biden administration has said it cannot afford to continue this level of spending unless Congress provides it with more funds. As a result, the administration has started to prepare for the transition of the vaccines to the commercial market. Pfizer and Moderna have already announced that the commercial prices of their Covid-19 vaccines will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose – or about three to four times what the federal government has paid.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHarry and Meghan Netflix documentary released today\n\nEveryone has been waiting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to spill the royal tea.

Police were seen clashing with demonstrators, who were throwing stones at the forces.\n\nOn Sunday, at least 50 people, including police officers and airport workers, were also being held as “hostages” after attacks and “acts of vandalism” by protesters at the Huancabamba de Andahuaylas airport in the city of Andahuaylas, the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation said in a statement.\n\nThe airport has been closed as a result, the organization said, adding that they have asked the national police for support and reinforcement and to help “safeguard the lives of the people who are being held hostage.” The organization did not provide information on the condition of the hostages.\n\nPeru’s Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation accused protesters of setting fire to the airport’s transmission room, fuel room and encircling the terminal with “acts of violence,” it said in a statement. It also said the landing strip and essential equipment had been “seriously affected.”\n\nThe country has been on the brink since Castillo’s ouster last week.\n\nMany Peruvians have been calling for a change in the political guard, according to September poll by the Institute of Peruvian Studies (IEP), which found 60% of those surveyed supported early elections to refresh both the presidency and Congress.\n\nBoluarte’s ascendency to the presidency may not necessarily ease Peru’s toxic and embittered political landscape.\n\nFernando Tuesta Soldevilla, professor of political science at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), told CNN that Boluarte “does not have a recognized political career. And without partisan support, political party or social organization behind her, she is weak from the beginning.”\n\n“Everyone knows when Dina Boluarte’s government began, but no one can be sure how long it will last,” he said.", "authors": ["Claudia Rebaza Hira Humayun Marlon Sorto Sahar Akbarzai", "Claudia Rebaza", "Hira Humayun", "Marlon Sorto", "Sahar Akbarzai"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/12/07/peru-president-pedro-castillo-tried-dissolve-congress/10852556002/", "title": "Pedro Castillo voted out; Peru president tried to dissolve Congress", "text": "Franklin Briceño\n\nAssociated Press\n\nLIMA, Peru – The president of Peru was ousted by Congress and arrested on a charge of rebellion Wednesday after he sought to dissolve the legislative body and take unilateral control of the government, triggering a grave constitutional crisis.\n\nVice President Dina Boluarte replaced Pedro Castillo and became the first female leader in the history of the republic after hours of wrangling between the legislature and the president, who had tried to prevent an impeachment vote.\n\nBoluarte, a 60-year-old lawyer, called for a political truce and the installation of a national unity government.\n\n“What I ask for is a space, a time to rescue the country,” she said.\n\nLawmakers voted 101-6 with 10 abstentions to remove Castillo from office for reasons of “permanent moral incapacity.”\n\nHe left the presidential palace in an automobile that carried him through Lima’s historic downtown. He entered a police station and hours later federal prosecutors announced that Castillo had been arrested on the rebellion charge for allegedly violating constitutional order. Witnesses saw some small-scale clashing between police and some protesters who had gathered near the station.\n\nWatch:Protest in Peruvian capital against President Castillo\n\nNovember:Supporters of Peru's President Pedro Castillo clash with riot police\n\n“We condemn the violation of constitutional order,” federal prosecutors said in a statement. “Peru's political constitution enshrines the separation of powers and establishes that Peru is a democratic and sovereign Republic ... No authority can put itself above the Constitution and must comply with constitutional mandates.”\n\nFluent in Spanish and Quechua, Boluarte was elected as vice president on the presidential ticket that brought Castillo to power July 28, 2021. During Castillo’s brief administration, Boluarte was minister of development and social inclusion.\n\nShortly before the impeachment vote, Castillo announced that he was installing a new emergency government and would rule by decree. He ordered a nightly curfew starting Wednesday night. The head of Peru's army then resigned, along with four ministers, including those over foreign affairs and the economy.\n\nThe Ombudsman's Office, an autonomous government institution, said before the congressional vote that Castillo should turn himself in to judicial authorities.\n\nAfter years of democracy, Peru is in the midst of a constitutional collapse “that can't be called anything but a coup,” the statement said.\n\nInternational reaction was at times outpaced by events.\n\nUnited States Amb. Lisa Kenna called on Castillo via Twitter to reverse his decree to dissolve Congress, saying the U.S. government rejected any “extra-constitutional” actions by the president to interfere with Congress.\n\nA short time later the Congress voted to remove Castillo.\n\nMexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said via Twitter that given recent events in Peru, Mexico had decided to postpone the Pacific Alliance summit scheduled for Dec. 14 in Lima. He said he regretted the recent developments and called for democracy and human rights to be respected.\n\nThe administration of Chilean President Gabriel Boric lamented the political situation in Peru and trusted that the crisis would be resolved through democratic mechanisms. Spain's government strongly condemned the break in constitutional order and congratulated the country on righting itself democratically.\n\nCastillo had said in an unusual midnight address on state television ahead of the vote that he would never stain “the good name of my honest and exemplary parents, who like millions of Peruvians, work every day to build honestly a future for their families.”\n\nThe peasant-turned-president said he’s paying for mistakes made due to inexperience. But he said a certain sector of Congress “has as its only agenda item removing me from office because they never accepted the results of an election that you, my dear Peruvians, determined with your votes.”\n\nCastillo has denied allegations of corruption against him, saying they’re based on “hearsay statements by people who, seeking to lighten their own punishments for supposed crimes by abusing my confidence, are trying to involve me without evidence.”\n\nFederal prosecutors are investigating six cases against Castillo, most of them for alleged corruption, under the theory that he had used his power to profit from public works.\n\nThe power struggle in Perú’s capital has continued as the Andes and its thousands of small farms struggle to survive the worst drought in a half-century. Without rain, farmers can’t plant potatoes, and the dying grass can no longer sustain herds of sheep, alpacas, vicuñas and llamas. Making matters worse, avian flu has killed at least 18,000 sea birds and infected at least one poultry producer, endangering the chicken and turkeys raised for traditional holiday meals.\n\nThe government also confirmed that in the past week, the country has suffered a fifth wave of COVID-19 infections. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 4.3 million Peruvians have been infected, and 217,000 of them have died.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

He changed his cabinet five times during his year and a half in office, running through 60 different cabinet officials, leaving various government agencies paralyzed.\n\nAlthough Castillo is the first president to be investigated while still in office, the probes are no surprise in a country where nearly every former president in the last 40 years have been charged with corruption linked to multinational corporations, such as the Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht.\n\nSince 2016, Perú has been entrenched in political crises, with congresses and presidents trying to eliminate each other in turn. President Martín Vizcarra (2018-2020) dissolved Congress in 2019 and ordered new elections. That new legislature removed Vizcarra the next year. Then came President Manuel Merino, who lasted less than a week before a crackdown killed two protesters and injured 200 more.

Regional watchers warn that the popularity of Bukele’s policy could see copycat measures in the region, with other countries in Latin America already enforcing similar extra-legal measures to tackle their own gang problems.\n\nAnd as Jonathan D. Rosen, an assistant professor at New Jersey City University, who has co-authored several books on organized crime, drug trafficking and security in the Americas, points out, history has shown that mano dura policies have a way of biting back.\n\n‘A perfect recipe for abuse’\n\nEl Salvador is home to some of the world’s most notorious gangs, including Barrio 18 and MS-13. The latter emerged in Los Angeles in the 1980s among Salvadoran immigrants who had fled their homeland amid a violent civil war funded in part by the United States. It grew to include other Central American migrants, and in the 1990s, many were deported to their home countries, causing an explosion of violence there, say experts.\n\nBefore Bukele’s crackdown, an estimated 70,000 active gang members across the country made it “virtually impossible for politicians and state officials to avoid engaging with them if they wish to, among other things, carry out an election campaign or provide services in poor neighborhoods,” according to a report by the Crisis Group.\n\nA police officer questions a young man during a security operation against gang violence in Soyapango, just east of the capital San Salvador, on August 16, 2022. Sthanly Estrada/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut rights groups fear the effort to root them out has taken a toll of its own, resulting in the arrest of 58,000 people between March and November 2022, overstuffed jails, and the militarization of Salvadorean society as forces patrol the streets.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele’s dragnet – torture and ill treatment in detention, and arbitrary arrests as the police and army target low-income neighborhoods, according to a HRW report released on December 7.\n\nMany of the arrests in the past year appear to be based on questionable evidence, such as the person’s appearance, background or anonymous tip-offs “and uncorroborated allegations on social media,” HRW writes.\n\nOn December 3, Bukele’s war on gangs escalated when security forces “completely fenced off” the country’s most populous municipality, Soyapango, as he described in a Twitter post. Bukele also shared a video showing gun-toting troops marching in the area.\n\nJuan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told CNN that the authoritarian measures in Soyapango constituted “a perfect recipe for abuse,” impeding on people’s freedom of movement.\n\n“There’s a trend in Latin America, of believing that in order to address very serious security concerns you need to suspend rights,” Pappier told CNN.\n\nPappier points to the example of Chile, which has had an extended state of emergency in response to violence in the country’s south, which was extended for a month in late November, and Ecuador, where the government announced similar measures in response to gang violence in prisons in November.\n\nEcudaor announced a state of emergency in response to gang violence in prisons. Juan Carlos Perez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, Honduras’ leftist leader Xiomara Castro, who ran for government on a human rights platform, launched a month-long partial state of emergency amid outcry against extortion levels, suspending constitutional rights in certain regions as she cracks down on criminal groups.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Jamaica – which has one of the highest murder rates in the Caribbean (per 100,000 people) – declared a widespread state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows security forces to arrest people and search buildings without warrants.\n\nWhen mano dura backfires\n\nPrevious Salvadoran governments have tried to tackle gangs with similar strategies only to worsen the outcome.\n\nFormer President Antonio Saca – who pleaded guilty in 2018 of embezzling $300 million in public funds – unveiled a plan known as “super mano dura,” where analysts say mass imprisonment led to gangs consolidating their power behind bars.\n\n“The deployment of the military and police to combat gangs resulted in the gangs fighting not only with each other but also with the government. In 2015, El Salvador surpassed Honduras as the most violent country in the world, with a murder rate of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The country has seen more violence in recent years than during the civil war,” according to a 2020 study by Rosen.\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele speaks to around 14,000 soldiers in El Salvador. Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTackling crime remained the top of the agenda in 2019, when Bukele swept into power promising to end corruption and gang violence. The millennial styled himself as an iconoclast with his embrace of bitcoin and fondness of backward baseball caps, but fears quickly mounted about his authoritarian tendencies.\n\nCritical journalists and civil society members were allegedly targeted by his administration, and in 2020, he sent armed troops into Congress as he demanded that lawmakers approve his plan to secure a loan to tackle gang violence. Last September, a constitutional court stacked with his allies, according to non-profit Freedom House, cleared the way for Bukele to run for two consecutive terms.\n\nIn 2022, El Salvador’s government denied responsibility for hacking the cell phones of at least 35 journalists and other members of civil society by using the spying program known as Pegasus.\n\nAs the country’s murder rate began to fall in 2020, reports emerged of Bukele’s government allegedly cutting a deal with gangs.\n\nAccording to a US Treasury Department statement, Bukele’s administration was accused of providing financial incentives to MS -13 and Barrio 18 in 2020 to “ensure that incidents of gang violence and the number of confirmed homicides remained low.”\n\nBukele’s government has denied the allegations, with Bukele describing it on Twitter as an “obvious lie.”\n\nThere is some consensus among security watchers that Bukele’s truce with the gangs fell apart “in late March (2022) which prompted the MS-16 to do the killing spree to pressure the government to give concessions,” said Breda.\n\nThe alleged move backfired, and Bukele announced a state of emergency and the suspension of several constitutional rights.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele's dragnet, according to a Human Rights Watch report. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccurate statistics have been hard to get hold of as authorities kept the data private, according to HRW. But citing a National Civil Police document they obtained, there was a 50% decrease in homicides between January and the end of October compared to the same period the last year, the rights group said in its report.\n\nOther analysts agree. “From what we hear from communities living close to gangs, they confirm that most of the gangs are on their knees, (many) have fled or hiding in rural areas, of course this is affecting more the rank-and-file members rather than the leadership (of the gangs),” Breda said.\n\nA new crisis\n\nRights experts have noted the US’ recent silence on the prolonged crackdown.\n\nAfter initially being tough on Bukele’s attacks on the rule of law, “most recently we have seen ambiguous positions, which seems to be part of the Biden administration obsession in preventing migration,” Pappier said.\n\nAlleged gang members at a maximum security prison in Izalco, El Salvador, on September 4, 2020. Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess crime will compel fewer people to leave the country and seek asylum in the US in the short term, he said. Though Pappier doubts it will last, as many families have lost their sole breadwinner in the crime sweep. “Some of them are scared of police…so the deprivations of rights also have a cost and can also generate its own migration,” he said.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN that “gang violence is a serious problem, and El Salvador and the United States have a vested interest in ensuring that these violent criminals are off the streets. At the same time, we have urged President Nayib Bukele and his administration to address the gang threat in a way that respects and protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of El Salvador.”\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated the US’ belief that the state of emergency “is an unsustainable policy that has raised serious concerns about human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and deaths.”\n\nEl Salvador now has the perfect conditions for recruiting new gang members, Pappier adds. “People with no connection to gangs are getting arrested, are in prisons, and are completely deprived of their livelihoods – that is the perfect kind of person to recruit,” Pappier said.\n\nSo will Bukele listen? “Have you noticed how the mainstream media and NGOs have intensified their attacks in recent days?” El Salvador’s President wrote on Twitter a day after HRW’s report was published.\n\n“It is not that they are interested in El Salvador (they never were), their fear is that we will succeed, because other governments will want to imitate it. They fear the power of example.”", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/08/iran-germany-peru-coup-mauna-loa-issa-rae/10852446002/", "title": "Daily Briefing: First protester executed by Iran", "text": "A prisoner convicted in Iran's ongoing protests has been executed.

One wrote that the president was \"100% chosen by God himself,\" and another wrote that he \"can truly be person of the decade, at least.\"\n\nThe original poster did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nMore:President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris named Time's 2020 Person of the Year\n\nBiden, Harris are 2020 'Person of the Year'; Trump honored in 2016\n\nBoth President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were chosen as Time's 2020 Person of the Year\n\n“The selection of Person of the Year is rarely easy, and this year was far more difficult than most… In Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we have two individuals whose election mirrored and moved the major stories of this year and whose fates will shape the nation’s role in the world and the future of the American experiment,\" Edward Felsenthal, Time magazine editor-in-chief and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nThe duo's win follows suit with Time's tradition of naming incoming presidents as its Person of the Year during an election year. However, Harris is the first vice president-elect to be given the title.\n\n\"It is one of my responsibilities,\" Harris told the magazine of her place in history. \"My mother had many sayings. She would say, 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things; make sure you’re not the last.' Which is why (in my victory speech), I said, 'I will be the first, but I will not be the last.' And that’s about legacy. That’s about leaving the door more open than it was when you walked in.\"\n\nFact check:Joe Biden, Kamala Harris – not China's Xi Jinping – are Time's 2020 Person of the Year\n\nTrump was 'Person of the Year' in 2016\n\nBut the image in the Facebook post of Trump isn't doctored; it's his 2016 cover for Person of the Year.\n\nTrump called the win a \"great honor\" in 2016. In bestowing that honor, Time magazine said Trump's victory shook up the U.S. political scene, for better or worse.\n\n\"For those who believe this is all for the better, Trump’s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism,\" the magazine said.\n\nTime added: \"To his believers, he delivers change — broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.\"\n\nTime has named a Person of the Year since 1927, and more often than not, elected and reelected presidents are given the title during an election year.\n\nBarack Obama won the title in both 2008 and 2012, and George W. Bush won in 2004 and 2000. Bill Clinton was awarded the title in 1992 and in 1998, though he shared the latter title with Ken Starr, who headed the investigation into Clinton's real estate investments. The first president to win the award was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.\n\nFact check:Altered image makes false claim about Time magazine's Person of the Year\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nA social media post that presents an image of President Donald Trump as Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" is MISSING CONTEXT because it may be misleading without additional information.

The free agent outfielder, who hit a AL-record 62 home runs last season has agreed to re-sign with the Yankees for a nine-year deal worth $360 million, according to a baseball official with direct knowledge of the contract.\n\nThe official spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized and Judge needs to pass a physical.\n\nJudge’s $360 million contract is the largest by a free agent in baseball history, topping Francisco Lindor's $341 million deal with the New York Mets.\n\nHe will earn $40 million per season, the highest average annual payout for a position player.\n\nPINSTRIPES: Aura of Yankee pinstripes too powerful for Aaron Judge to leave\n\nTOP-PAID: Where does Judge's contract rank among MLB's highest paid players?\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now\n\nThe Yankees won what was believed to be a two-team competition for Judge's services, with the San Francisco Giants also in the running. However, the San Diego Padres made an eleventh hour bid, apparently offering him an even more lucrative deal than the Yankees did.\n\nIn the end, Yankees GM Brian Cashman was able to get the deal done.\n\nJudge, 30, bet on himself last offseason, rejecting a deal worth $213.5 million over seven years from 2023-29. But he turned it down before opening day in April. He then proceeded to have one of the greatest contract-year performances in history — hitting .311 with 133 runs scored and 131 RBI — and breaking Roger Maris' AL home run record that had stood for 61 years.\n\nIn seven seasons with the Yankees, Judge has blasted a total of 220 home runs while also showing a keen eye at the plate, as evidenced by his .394 on-base percentage. This past season, he showed his defensive versatility by filling a major void and playing a career-high 78 games in center field. Not surprisingly, Judge led all major leaguers with 10.6 Wins Above Replacement.\n\nIt all added up to Judge being the overwhelming choice for AL MVP. He received 28 of the 30 first-place votes in easily outdistancing two-way star Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nContributing: Bob Nightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/06/22/mlb-highest-paid-players/7687404001/", "title": "MLB's highest paid players: Aaron Judge, Max Scherzer make the list", "text": "Major League Baseball’s offseason has seen some major moves, shaking up the salary rankings. Aaron Judge, the reigning American League MVP, is set to finalize the largest ever contract signed by a free agent. The New York Yankees re-signed Judge to a nine-year, $360 million contract that will pay him $40 million per season and ensure the 30-year-old retires at the club.\n\nJudge has secured his spot among the league’s highest earners.

He told Judge how he felt about him, reminded him what he means to the Yankee organization, but when the conversation ended, Boone had no hints where Judge was headed.\n\n“I really didn’t know,’’ Boone told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday morning before a breakfast gathering with managers. “He didn’t tell me. All I knew is that the Padres were now involved, along with the Giants.\n\n“I went to bed, and really, just hoped for the best.’’\n\nBoone woke up about 5 in the morning Wednesday.\n\nHe checked his phone.\n\nThere were several text messages, including one from Yankees GM Brian Cashman.\n\nJudge was staying with the Yankees.\n\nJudge, the Yankees’ greatest power hitter since Babe Ruth, agreed to the most lucrative free-agent contract in baseball history: nine years, $360 million contract.\n\nBoone exhaled.\n\nYankee fans wildly celebrated.\n\nAnd the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres grieved.\n\nPINSTRIPES: Aura of Yankee pinstripes too powerful for Aaron Judge to leave\n\nTOP-PAID: Where does Judge's contract rank among MLB's highest paid players?\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now\n\n“Congratulations,’’ Giants manager Gabe Kapler told Boone upon seeing him at 9 in the morning.\n\nKapler then thumped his chest with his right arm, and said, “But this one hurts.’’\n\nThe Giants also offered Judge a nine-year, $360 million contract, giving him the opportunity to come home to Northern California, two hours where he grew up in Linden, Calif., and become their greatest attraction since Barry Bonds.\n\n“I think we pulled out all of the stops,’’ one high-ranking Giants official said. “We left it all on the field, as the say.’’\n\nThe Padres, who entered the Judge sweepstakes late, sent a private plane Tuesday for Judge, and spoke with him for more than two hours at Petco Park, just a few blocks from the Grand Hyatt winter meeting hotel. Judge and his representatives met with Padres owner Peter Seidler, GM A.J. Preller and manager Bob Melvin.\n\nThe Padres didn’t submit an official offer in writing, but informed Judge they would pay him $400 million over 10 years.\n\nJudge and his representatives left Petco Park, went back to their hotel, when the Yankees made one final push.\n\nYankees owner Hal Steinbrenner, who was in Italy, telephoned Judge and asked him directly:\n\n“Do you want to be a Yankee?’’\n\nJudge reiterated it was still his desire, and Steinbrenner responded by asking just what it would take to sign him.\n\nJudge asked the Yankees to at least match the Giants’ offer.\n\nSteinbrenner quickly agreed.\n\nAnd the Yankees got their man.\n\nCashman spent the night working out the details – which includes a full no-trade clause – and will be finalized once the contract language is complete and Judge takes a physical.\n\nCashman arrived at a press briefing Wednesday morning with no sleep, but elated, calling Steinbrenner the Mariano Rivera of the negotiations.\n\n“Our owner spearheaded efforts, as he stated he would do everything in his power to retain Aaron Judge,’’ Cashman said. “Rest assured, he’s putting his money where his mouth is.\n\n“The Steinbrenner family has consistently allowed us to pursue or retain some of the greatest that are available on a year in, and year out basis.’’\n\nSteinbrenner, of course, is a businessman, too, and he realized the financial consequences of losing Judge. Judge is easily the Yankees’ biggest marquee attraction, and the leader in all merchandise sales. Simply, Steinbrenner was going to do everything possible to make sure he didn’t get away.\n\nIt didn’t matter if the Yankees had pivoted and spent $1 billion on the free agent market, it wasn’t going to replace Judge, the lineage of past Yankee sluggers from Ruth to Gehrig to DiMaggio to Mantle to Maris.\n\n“Clearly, I never had to negotiate and try to retain somebody that just broke Roger Maris’ American League home run record,’’ Cashman said. “But I have been heavily involved of engaging many a great players, and this speaks to the Steinbrenner family that we have been in the position that they have allowed us to engage the planet’s best players.\n\n“We’re in a position to try to secure great players with the ultimate goal of having a great team.’’\n\nStill, despite their financial clout, the Yankees were scared to to death that they nearly lost their man. Team officials were sent into a sheer panic Tuesday afternoon when an erroneous report circulated that Judge was signing with the Giants.\n\n“[Tuesday] was a long rough day in a lot of ways,’’ Boone said. “I was concerned all day.\n\n“It’s a weird time [when] a guy you spend a lot of time with, the face of your team, as important as a player he is, out there playing the free agent game. It’s an awkward time, especially at the winter meetings. Things get sped up, and you know a decision is probably coming soon, it definitely made a very uncomfortable day.’’\n\nThen again, the Yankees made life stressful for Judge this season, too. He rejected a seven-year, $213.5 million contract offer before opening day, and was angry that the the Yankees revealed their offer.\n\nSo Judge, 30, decided to bet on himself.\n\nAnd walked away from the poker table with $360 million worth of chips, receiving an extra $146.5 million by waiting a year.\n\n“You’re talking about one of the game’s great players,’’ Cashman said, “and as his career develops over the course of time, hopefully he’s going to be one of the game’s greatest players.’’\n\nJudge’s deal exceeds Francisco Lindor's 10-year, $341 million free-agent contract with the New York Mets.\n\nThe only bigger commitments in baseball is Mike Trout's 12-year, $426.5 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels and Mookie Betts’ 12-year, $365 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Trout added a 10-year, $360 million extension to his previous deal and Betts' was merely an extension, he never reached free agency.\n\nJudge's $40 million average salary is the highest by a position player in history.\n\n“I always felt like he certainly belongs in pinstripes,’’ Boone said. “He’s an amazing player, an amazing person, that certainly has the respect of everyone in that room.\n\n“When you have a player of that caliber that is beloved and important as he is on a daily basis, you want to do your best to hang onto that.\n\n“This is an enormous boost to us.’’\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2022/07/06/aaron-judge-contract-talks-new-york-yankees-hal-steinbrenner/7827302001/", "title": "Yankees owner on Aaron Judge contract talks: Discussions to be had", "text": "PITTSBURGH – These days, Hal Steinbrenner’s inbox is not overflowing with critical pinstriped problems to address.\n\nYet, in the coming weeks, there will be key decisions to make before the Aug. 2 trade deadline.\n\nThere is the lingering issue of Aaron Judge’s impending free agency, and the constant reminders that the Yankees have not paraded through the Canyon of Heroes since 2009.\n\nBut halfway through the 2022 MLB season, the Yankees (58-23) own baseball’s best record, on pace for 116 regular-season wins.\n\n“I knew we had a team capable of great things,’’ Steinbrenner said, though he did not envision this historic start.\n\n“This is a special team,\" he said.\n\nMLB All-Star Game:The most deserving starters based on a full season's worth of stats\n\nSign up for our sports newsletter:All the sports news you need to know delivered right to you!\n\nHere are the bullet points of the Yankees managing general partner’s Wednesday media session at the season’s midpoint:\n\nAaron Judge contract talks\n\nNo, Steinbrenner won’t provide updates on the status of negotiations to keep his best player in the Bronx beyond 2022.\n\nYes, “there’s no doubt’’ Steinbrenner wants Judge to remain on a long-term deal.\n\n“But there’s a lot of discussion to be had,’’ said Steinbrenner, suggesting that substantive talks would occur after the season.\n\n“I completely agreed with Aaron… that in no way shape or form can this be a distraction,’’ Steinbrenner said. “The sole focus is winning a championship, that’s all anyone needs to worry about right now.’’\n\nNo regrets about Judge offer\n\nAt the ownership level, there is no second guessing about the “very good’’ offer Judge rejected hours before Opening Day, nor the club’s decision to make that offer public.\n\n“We just didn’t get a deal done,’’ said Steinbrenner, who referenced the shorter offseason window due to MLB’s lockout. “We had less time but there’s no regrets.’’\n\nBased on Judge’s MVP-caliber season, those talks would start with a far higher number than the $30.5 million annually offered by the Yanks through the 2029 season.\n\n“Of course, it’s a possibility. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,’’ said Steinbrenner, adding that Judge’s performance and leadership has “been phenomenal’’ this year.\n\n“He’s a guy that’s confident, that believes in his talent and that’s what you’re seeing this year. And we’re all thrilled.’’\n\nWhat will happen at MLB trade deadline?\n\nSteinbrenner suggested that the Yankees are several weeks away from moving into the War Room at Tampa, Florida, and discussing potential trades.\n\nWould the Yankees seek to exploit their double-digit AL East lead and strike a significant deal for a starting pitcher or a big-name outfielder at the cost of big-time prospects or a payroll spike above the next luxury tax threshold?\n\nSpeaking generally, Steinbrenner said that if general manager Brian Cashman presented a deal that might “bring us over the top, (if) we’re not where we need to be yet’’ in the assessment of his baseball operations staff, “then I’m going to consider it.\n\n“I am hesitant to give up prospects, I always have been. But we’ve done it in the past and all that will be on the table, too.’’\n\nAny concerns for Hal Steinbrenner going forward?\n\nSteinbrenner identified the remaining schedule, especially within the division, and “staying healthy’’ as two items of concern.\n\n“But as far as individual players, individual positions, we just haven’t talked about any of that yet,’’ Steinbrenner said.\n\nMore Yankees:Trailblazing minor league manager Rachel Balkovec just wants 'to get better'\n\nMLB power rankings:Astros primed to push Yankees atop American League\n\nThe Yankees’ overall pitching, improved defense and middle-of-the order production has allowed them to overcome subpar offensive performances by Aaron Hicks and Josh Donaldson and the empty production of Joey Gallo.\n\n“He’s grinding it out, he’s got the support of all of us,’’ Steinbrenner said. “I still expect great things out of him.’’\n\nSteinbrenner referenced the organizational reinforcements on the horizon, such as reliever Jonathan Loaisiga. And the Yanks have potential outfield upgrades one level below in Estevan Florial and Miguel Andujar.\n\nWhat does Hal think of Houston Astros?\n\nJust as in 2017 and 2019, with more controversial clubs, the Houston Astros could be standing in the Yankees' path toward a pennant.\n\n“We all need to be concerned about Houston, they’re a very good team,’’ Steinbrenner said of a potential October clash. “It’s going to be a challenge, but it’s going to be a challenge for them, too, make no mistake.’’\n\nAnd what about the first-place, Buck Showalter-led Mets?\n\nHaving two good New York teams at the same time is “a good thing, and I think meeting in the postseason – I’m all for it,’’ Steinbrenner said of a potential Subway World Series.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/12/11/yankees-harpoon-cole-cashmans-white-whale-on-3rd-try/40804485/", "title": "Yankees harpoon Cole, Cashman's `white whale,' on 3rd try", "text": "AP\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) — Meeting with Gerrit Cole and the pitcher's wife for the first time last week at the Fashion Island Hotel in Newport Beach, Brian Cashman tossed out a literary reference that prompted laughter.\n\n\"You're my white whale,\" the New York Yankees general manager told him. \"He was someone we drafted in the first round and he chose to go to college. And we tried to trade for him, and Pittsburgh chose to trade him to Houston instead. So we're hoping three's a charm.\"\n\nIt was. With the help of a record $324 million, nine-year contract.\n\nCashman harpooned the biggest prize in the free-agent market, agreeing to a deal with the 29-year-old right-hander on Tuesday night, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the agreement, subject to a successful physical, had not been announced.\n\nAfter two dominant seasons with Houston, Cole will join a rotation that projects to include Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, James Paxton and J.A. Happ or Domingo Germán, and a roster built around young stars Aaron Judge, Gleyber Torres and Gary Sánchez.\n\n\"You're talking about a guy that is the best of the best,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday. \"You're just hopefully finishing off a team that can potentially win a championship.\"\n\nAfter several seasons of payroll restraint — at least by pinstriped standards — the Yankees increased their projected luxury tax payroll to $247 million. That is $39 million above the initial threshold and about $1 million below the start of the highest surtax and a penalty that would back the Yankees' top 2021 amateur draft pick by 10 slots. New York is on track to owe at least $14 million in tax for 2020 and even more if outfielder Brett Gardner is re-signed and additions are made to the bullpen.\n\nOther than taking on high-priced outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees in recent years had promoted prospects and acquired cost-effective options that included Luke Voit and Gio Urshela\n\n\"I think we're just using every tool in the toolbox, not just the big hammer, but it doesn't mean the big hammer is not still available,\" Cashman said,\n\nIn adding Cole, the Yankees will forfeit their second-highest pick next June, about No. 64, their fifth-highest, about No. 175, and $1 million of 2020-21 international signing bonus allocation. Houston will receive an extra pick, somewhere around No. 75.\n\nVoit seemed set to cede his uniform to Cole.\n\n\"Hey the number 45 jersey fits really weird and runs really big,\" Voit tweeted. \"Not a problem that you will want worry about for 9 years so I'll take care of it.\"\n\nCole grew up a Yankees fan. Newark's The Star-Ledger ran a photo that caught the then 11-year-old in the stands before Game 6 of the 2001 World Series in Phoenix holding a pinstriped sign that read: \"Yankee Fan Today Tomorrow Forever.\"\n\n\"You're seeing a guy that's really talented, really good at his craft, really intelligent,\" Boone said. \"This is what greatness can look like when it all gets synced up.\"\n\nNew York was thought to have outbid the Angels and Dodgers, the teams closest to Cole's home.\n\n“With our flexibility, if we miss a big player there’s still very talented players that are accessible in the free agent and trade market right now,\" Angels general manager Billy Eppler said.\n\nYankees owner Hal Steinbrenner had several conversations with Boras and authorized the guarantee of a ninth year. Cole was drafted by the Yankees with the 28th overall pick in 2008, but he spurned then and enrolled at UCLA.\n\n\"We definitely weren't mad at the Cole family or Gerrit Cole himself. More mad at ourselves,\" Cashman said. \"I don't think many high school kids being drafted in the first round by their childhood dream team with financial components coming their way that far exceed what a college scholarship would be worth would say, `I'm going to college because it'll all work out and I'm going to bet on myself.'\"\n\nBoston Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom said Cole's decision wouldn't cause the Red Sox to make a move in response.\n\n\"Look, we want to beat the Yankees as badly as anybody, trust me,\" he said. “I think it's really just a question of us being able to step back and say, what is the best approach for us to do that? The more that we feel we're being reactive to other teams' moves, I think the more we're playing their game.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Janie McCauley and Bernie Wilson contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/11/11/mlb-top-free-agents-2022-best-players-available-signing-updates/10660446002/", "title": "MLB top free agents 2022: Best players available, signing updates", "text": "If Major League Baseball is truly a copycat industry, this should be a lucrative winter for free agents.\n\nFive years after executive indifference led to a chilling, multiyear depression for top players, one year after a 99-day lockout split a sizzling market in half and led to a frenzied signing period just days from Opening Day, some semblance of stability has returned to baseball.\n\nThe COVID-19 cancellations and restrictions of 2020-21 are largely gone.

Rankings based on projected future performance and perceived market value:\n\n(Age as of April 1, 2023; 2022 team)\n\n1. Aaron Judge (30, OF, Yankees)\n\nHe does not play the game’s most premium position, but Judge has many factors in his favor: A potential bi-coastal bidding war, a Yankees franchise that should be highly motivated to retain him and, oh yeah, the AL-record 62 homers he slugged last season. Judge may not get the lengthy deal the younger shortstop on this list may receive, but a high annual value and his greater appeal should put him atop this winter’s market.\n\nSIGNED: Nine years, $360 million with Yankees, Dec. 7.\n\n2. Carlos Correa (28, SS, Twins)\n\nOne year after topping this list, Correa is back, after accepting an opt-out laden, lockout-driven deal that paid him $35.5 million last season. After duplicating his on-base percentage (.366), increasing his adjusted OPS (140) but seeing a slip in some defensive metrics, Correa is a year older but just as good. If 10 years, $350 million was a shoot-for-the-sky number last year, why not nine years, $315 million this time?\n\nSIGNED: 13 years, $350 million with Giants, Dec. 13.\n\n3. Trea Turner (29, SS, Dodgers)\n\nIf Correa is No. 1 among shortstops, Turner is very much 1A, a year older but quicker, showing better afield but with less power, less reliable in walk rate and OBP but also a legitimate game-changer. Will the Dodgers realize how special their Turner-Mookie Betts-Freddie Freeman power trio is, or will they return to “fiscal responsibility” and replace Turner internally? Either way, he will draw huge interest from Philly to Frisco, and has a good shot at cracking the $300 million barrier.\n\nSIGNED: 11 years, $300 million with Phillies, Dec. 5.\n\n4. Xander Bogaerts (30, SS, Red Sox)\n\nLike Judge, Bogaerts has a significant factor in his favor: A huge market quickly growing impatient with its front office and ready to howl in protest should a core player depart via free agency. Bogaerts’ departure would only ramp up the angst in Boston one year ahead of Rafael Devers’ free agency. Oh, and he can play: Bogaerts produced 6.1 fWAR last season and led all shortstops with a .377 OBP.\n\nSIGNED: 11 years, $280 million with Padres, Dec. 7.\n\n5. Dansby Swanson (29, SS, Braves)\n\nIf you don’t consider Swanson a “franchise player” the way you would Correa or Turner, perhaps further examination is necessary. Swanson blew away the shortstop field in outs above average (21) and trailed only Francisco Lindor with 6.4 WAR. Now that he’s aged into more power, averaging 26 homers the past two seasons, there’s far more to tangibly love about Swanson beyond the fact he quarterbacked five consecutive division champions.\n\nSIGNED: Seven years, $177 million with Cubs, Dec. 17.\n\n6. Jacob deGrom (34, SP, Mets)\n\nIs there a more volatile player on the market? DeGrom brings the upside of a two-time Cy Young Award winner and a guy who struck out 14.3 batters per nine innings each of the past two seasons – and the downside of a pitcher limited to 26 starts over those two years due to assorted injuries. Perhaps the Mets keep it simple, offer him a deal that mirrors running mate Max Scherzer’s (three years, $130 million) and everyone calls it a day at $43 million per year. But will deGrom want more guaranteed cash? Will a pitching-hungry team ignore the red flags and pay him like a starter in his prime?\n\nSIGNED: Five years, $185 million with Rangers, Dec. 2.\n\n7. Justin Verlander (40, SP, Astros)\n\nVerlander’s body may be entering its fifth decade, but his elbow is just a year old, and he was electric in his first season removed from Tommy John surgery. While Verlander will still be subject to myriad old man pains – such as the calf injury that knocked him out for a few weeks near the end of the season – his new arm produced a 1.75 ERA and 185 strikeouts. Now, will an aggressive suitor guarantee his wish that he pitch until he’s at least 45?\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $86 million with Mets, Dec. 5.\n\n8. Carlos Rodon (30, SP, Giants)\n\nRodon fused the dominance of a career comeback year in 2021 with good health in 2022, making 31 starts and leading the majors in strikeouts per nine innings (12) and fielding independent pitching (2.25). Now, a well-timed opt-out means the best lefty on the market will flirt with a nine-figure contract.\n\nSIGNED: Six years, $162 million with Yankees, Dec. 15.\n\n9. Willson Contreras (30, C, Cubs)\n\nAre the Cubs ready to bid farewell to the last everyday connection to their World Series winners? They could do worse than retain a catcher who’s still a four-win player, can still churn out an .815 OPS, and would become a crucial part of any club’s foundation.\n\nSIGNED: Five years, $87.5 million with Cardinals, Dec. 7.\n\n10. Tyler Anderson (33, SP, Dodgers)\n\nFeel free to scoff at a pitcher who cut his ERA nearly in half, to 2.57, and made the All-Star Game after bouncing around four clubs the previous three years. We’re inclined to believe the Anderson breakout, that his true self will land somewhere between his ERA and his 3.31 FIP, provided a club well-versed in getting the best out of him, as the Dodgers did, is inclined to buy into his career season.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $39 million with Angels, Nov. 15.\n\n11. Brandon Nimmo (30, CF, Mets)\n\nWhile two of his past five seasons have been injury-shortened, it’s tough to argue with Nimmo’s offensive consistency in that span: An .837 OPS (134 adjusted), a .388 OBP and 55 extra-base hits per 162 games. In 2022 he was borderline elite in center field and will hold down a premium position and the leadoff spot for any suitor.\n\nSIGNED: Eight years, $162 million with Mets, Dec. 8.\n\n12. Chris Bassitt (34, SP, Mets)\n\nHe may not be an ace, but Bassitt is pretty much money in the bank as a No. 3 starter. Bassitt held down the Mets rotation when Scherzer and deGrom were injured and his WHIP, ERA and strikeout-walk ratio have hovered in the same range the past four years. A big-market suitor with an established No. 1 would be an ideal fit.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $63 million with Blue Jays, Dec. 12.\n\n13. Kenley Jansen (35, RP, Braves)\n\nHis price tag soared when Edwin Diaz accepted $105 million to return to the Mets, establishing a ceiling for relievers while plucking the best one off the market. Jansen got $80 million from the Dodgers six years ago and while that may be unrealistic, supply and demand will drive his price high after leading the majors in saves (41) and striking out 12 batters per nine innings.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $32 million with Red Sox, Dec. 7.\n\n14. Anthony Rizzo (33, 1B, Yankees)\n\nWhile Rizzo posted a full-season career low .224 batting average, he still muscled 32 balls out of Yankee Stadium and his .817 OPS was his best since 2019. Plenty of demand for a middle-of-the-lineup bat and Gold Glove-caliber defender.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $40 million with Yankees, Nov. 15.\n\n15. Nathan Eovaldi (31, SP, Red Sox)\n\nTime is both Eovaldi's friend and foe. He's five years removed from Tommy John surgery and just one year past an All-Star campaign where he struck out 195 and led the AL in starts (32) and FIP (2.79). But injuries limited him to 20 starts this year and the mileage on his body may make getting longer than a four-year deal challenging.\n\n16. Taijuan Walker (30, SP, Mets)\n\nAfter a decade of fits and starts, Walker has settled into who he is and it’s pretty good: A 3.65 FIP that mirrors his 3.49 ERA and a 1.20 WHIP that will look just fine on the market. Walker has made 29 starts each of the past two seasons and represents a nice mid-range rotation option - particularly since he won't be saddled with the qualifying offer, as teammates Bassitt and deGrom will.\n\nSIGNED: Four years, $72 million with Phillies, Dec. 6.\n\n17. Josh Bell (30, 1B, Padres)\n\nFew switch hitters offer the plate coverage and power potential the 6-4, 260-pound Bell does. He struggled after a midseason trade, with his OPS dipping from .877 in Washington to .587 in San Diego, but offers a career .351 OBP and an easily expected 25 homers.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $33 million with Guardians, Dec. 6.\n\n18. Clayton Kershaw (35, SP, Dodgers)\n\nFeels like the same tune as before: Back to L.A. on a short-term deal or into the carpool line. Maybe the Rangers but maybe not. Either way, Kershaw had a strong bounceback from 2021 elbow woes, making 22 starts and posting a 2.57 FIP that was his best since 2016.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $20 million with Dodgers, Dec. 5.\n\n19. Jose Abreu (36, 1B/DH, White Sox)\n\nHis White Sox for life stint may finally be ending after nine seasons and 243 home runs, with Andrew Vaughn slated to take over at first. In his advanced age, Abreu has sacrificed some power (a career-low 15 homers in 2022) but not production (.824 OPS).\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $58.5 million with Astros, Nov. 29.\n\n20. Michael Wacha (31, SP, Red Sox)\n\nAfter three seasons as a swing guy, Wacha started 22 games with Boston and showed well, his 1.12 WHIP and 127 adjusted ERA full-season career bests. He’s made 22 starts each of the past two seasons, which won’t guarantee him frontline money, but Wacha is settling into a nice comfort zone somewhere between the phenom he was and the injury-addled pitcher who struggled late last decade.\n\n21. Martín Perez (31, SP, Rangers)\n\nYet another late-career lefty who makes you wonder, just how real was last year? Perez flourished back in Arlington, posting career bests in ERA (2.89) and FIP (3.26), giving up just 0.5 home runs per nine innings and making his first All-Star team. His career marks entering the season – 4.71, 4.54, 1.5. Feeling lucky?\n\nSIGNED: Accepted one-year, $19.65 million qualifying offer from Rangers, Nov. 15.\n\n22. Jameson Taillon (31, SP, Yankees)\n\nAfter two Tommy John surgeries, Taillon found himself in the Bronx, settling in not as the ace drafted between Bryce Harper and Manny Machado but rather a steady mid-rotation option. Taillon equaled his career high with 32 starts and posted the best strikeout-walk ratio (4.72) of his career while his 3.91 ERA landed on league average a second consecutive year.\n\nSIGNED: Four years, $68 million with Cubs, Dec. 7.\n\n23. Rafael Montero (32, RP, Astros)\n\nMontero capped a career season – a 2.37 ERA over 71 appearances, just three homers allowed – with a fantastic playoff run that only further showcased him before a first trip to the free agent market. Montero punched out 10 in 9 ⅓ playoff innings over 10 games and took part in a combined no-hitter. Perhaps not a closer, but certainly will be a valued seventh- or eighth-inning guy.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $34.5 million, with Astros.\n\n24. Joc Pederson (30, OF, Giants)\n\nWill a second dip into free agency yield Pederson more than the one-year deal San Francisco gave him? Perhaps his future will be as a platoon guy, but the Giants also deployed him well: He smacked 23 home runs, one every 16.5 at-bats, his best rate since hitting 37 in the juiced-ball 2019 season. You could do worse than a useful outfielder who rakes against right-handers, which is why the Giants extended him the $19.65 million qualifying offer that will likely produce a return engagement.\n\nSIGNED: Accepted one-year, $19.65 million qualifying offer from Giants, Nov. 15.\n\n25. Seth Lugo (33, RP, Mets)\n\nThe Mets have a dozen free agents and many share an identical profile: Really valuable to us, but should fetch a lot of cash on the open market. Toss Lugo in that bin: He appeared in a career-high 65 games this season and struck out more than a batter an inning for the fifth consecutive year. They can surely get by without him, but those numbers aren’t easy to replace.\n\n26. Robert Suarez (32, RP, Padres)\n\nBehold the most fascinating reliever on the market. Suarez has just one major league season to his credit, but dominated after spending eight seasons in Mexico and Japan, striking out 61 in 47 ⅔ innings. He overpowered the Dodgers in the NLDS before giving up a pennant-winning home run to Bryce Harper in the NLCS. Still, there’s not much tread on the arm and the market is thin, so don’t be surprised when Suarez gets a large payday.\n\nSIGNED: Five years, $46 million with Padres.\n\n27. J.D. Martinez (35, DH, Red Sox)\n\nThe landscape has changed a lot since Martinez signed a five-year, $110 million deal with Boston. Good news: The NL added the designated hitter. Bad news: Martinez’s power has diminished a bit, hitting just 16 homers in 139 games. He still thumped 43 doubles, though, and a 30-team market for his services will ensure a decent payday.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $10 million with Dodgers, Dec. 17.\n\n28. Johnny Cueto (37, SP, White Sox)\n\nA nice revival for the quick-pitching right-hander, whose 158 ⅓-inning total was his highest since his 2016 All-Star campaign. The innings-eaters thin out pretty quickly on this list, making postmodern Cueto a decent gamble for mid-range rotation help.\n\n29. Jose Quintana (34, SP, Cardinals)\n\nA wild ride for Quintana, who looked cooked after a lost 2021 but posted a 2.93 ERA over 32 starts and got the Game 1 nod in the playoffs after a trade from Pittsburgh to St. Louis. Betting on a repeat might be foolhardy, but Quintana suppresses home runs (majors-best 0.4 per nine) and controls the strike zone, which is most of the battle these days.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $26 million with Mets, Dec. 7.\n\n30. Ross Stripling (33, SP, Blue Jays)\n\nBehold the majors’ self-awareness king, who knows he won’t strike out many guys, isn’t built to go deep into games but knows how to deliver quality innings. Stripling provided a 1.02 WHIP over 134 ⅓ innings and can start, “open” or pitch bulk relief innings.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $25 million with Giants, Dec. 13.\n\n31. Andrew Benintendi (28, OF, Yankees)\n\nA strange 2022 for Benintendi, who posted a career-best .373 OBP, made the AL All-Star team and then fractured a hamate bone after a trade from Kansas City to New York. He hit just five home runs in 461 at-bats. Yet his age is such that there could still be growth for Benintendi – from an acumen and/or power standpoint.\n\nSIGNED: Five years, $75 million with White Sox, Dec. 16.\n\n32. Matt Moore (33, RP, Rangers)\n\nThanks to advanced metrics, teams are finding they can get by without a left-handed reliever (see: Astros), but Moore morphed into one of the best in his first season exclusively out of the bullpen. Moore struck out 10 per nine innings and notched five saves and 14 holds with just one blown save.\n\n33. Mitch Haniger (32, OF, Mariners)\n\nInjuries have limited Haniger to 277 games since 2018, but he’s managed a 120 adjusted OPS over the past two seasons, including a 39-homer campaign in 2021.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $43.5 million with Giants, Dec. 6.\n\n34. Corey Kluber (36, SP, Rays)\n\nThe former Cy Young Award winner topped the 30-start mark for the first time since 2018 and while he posted a 4.34 ERA, did lead the majors in fewest walks (1.2) per nine innings. A friendly ballpark and an elite defensive team would make a particularly good fit for Kluber, who may get a multiyear commitment after signing a pair of one-year deals.\n\n35. Noah Syndergaard (30, SP, Phillies)\n\nAn odd but effective 2022 for Thor, who in his first full-bore year back from Tommy John surgery pitched above league average in 24 starts for the Angels and Phillies before adopting a swingman role in the postseason. Whether he can build back toward the guy who tossed 197 innings in 2019 is uncertain, but in the right hands, he should take another step toward the previous version of himself.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $13 million with Dodgers, Dec. 14.\n\n36. Drew Smyly (33, SP, Cubs)\n\nSmyly’s 2023 team will likely be his eighth in 10 seasons, but he might finally lay down some roots. While he pitched just 106 ⅓ innings, Smyly posted a 3.47 ERA and a 118 adjusted ERA and is firmly atop a second tier of available lefty starters.\n\n37. Zach Eflin (28, SP/RP, Phillies)\n\nRecovering from a knee injury hatched a pleasant surprise for the Phillies and Eflin, who, lacking the runway to build back as a starter, became a crucial relief weapon for them down the stretch and in the playoffs. Eflin tossed 6 ⅓ scoreless innings over six games of the NLCS and World Series, and he gave up just one earned run in 7 ⅓ relief innings in the regular season. Perhaps a Philly reunion, where they know what he can bring to the table, is the best outcome for all.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $40 million with Rays, Dec. 1.\n\n38. Andrew Chafin (32, RP, Tigers)\n\nOpted out after a solid single season in Detroit, where he punched out 67 in 57 ⅓ innings. Salty veteran presence will play well in a veteran or developing bullpen.\n\n39. Chris Martin (36, RP, Dodgers)\n\nYet another L.A. success story, as Martin went from mop-up work with the Cubs (4.31 ERA in 34 games) to a high-leverage slot with the Dodgers (1.46 ERA in 24 games). Come playoff time, he was an eighth- or ninth-inning guy; for his sake, here’s hoping he bottled whatever the Dodgers gave him.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $17.5 million with Red Sox, Dec. 2.\n\n40. Brandon Drury (30, INF/OF, Padres)\n\nAfter churning through four teams in seven seasons, Drury found his groove in 2022, smacking a career-best 28 homers with the Reds and Padres, winning a Silver Slugger award. He added five RBI in the NLCS and, with his multi-positional versatility, may have found a niche by his 30th birthday.\n\n41. Jordan Lyles (32, SP, Orioles)\n\nThe Lyles-Orioles union was ideal: Veteran starter provides innings and counsel to young, unproven staff. Now, they’re ready to move on, declining Lyles’ $11 million club option. But Lyles posts, logging 180 and 179 innings the past two seasons and should do the same for a similarly green staff in 2023.\n\n42. Kevin Kiermaier (32, OF, Rays)\n\nKiermaier seems as much a part of Tampa Bay as grouper sandwiches and pop-up showers, but the club declined his ’23 option, which likely marks the end of his decade at Tropicana Field. Kiermaier totes a .308 career OBP and will be coming off hip surgery, but remains one of the game’s elite defensive center fielders.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $9 million with Blue Jays, Dec. 9.\n\n43. Andrew Heaney (31, SP/RP, Dodgers)\n\nInjuries limited Heaney to 72 ⅔ innings but, as so many do, he renewed his career with the Dodgers, posting his finest season since 2015. Heaney struck out 110 and posted a 1.08 WHIP and likely found a road map for optimal usage – mostly starter, sometimes reliever, deployed in multi-inning bursts.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $25 million with Rangers, Dec. 6.\n\n44. Adam Ottavino (37, RP, Mets)\n\nOttavino has pitched in five consecutive postseasons and, even as he nears 40, still finds himself in high-leverage situations for playoff teams. He dropped his WHIP below 1.00 for the first time since 2018 and posted a fabulous 188 adjusted ERA.\n\n45. Justin Turner (38, 3B, Dodgers)\n\nThe Dodgers unsurprisingly declined his $16 million option and it’d be equally unsurprising if they brought him back at a lesser salary. Turner turned in a respectable .278/.350/.438 season, though his home run output dipped from 27 to 13.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $21.7 million with Red Sox, Dec. 18.\n\n46. Rich Hill (43, SP, Red Sox)\n\nIt may once again be Boston or bust for Hill, who has expressed an interest in returning and also representing the USA in the World Baseball Classic. Even if he’s just a five-inning guy in his advanced age, Hill remains valued in Boston and a return seems quite possible.\n\n47. Yuli Gurriel (38, 1B, Astros)\n\nFrom batting champion to below-average hitter, it’s fair to wonder if time has caught up with Gurriel, whose average has fluctuated greatly the past four seasons: .298, .232, .319, .242. He rallied with a fabulous postseason, posting a .347/.360/.490 line in 50 plate appearances and that’s probably where his future lies: Part-time bat on a contending team.\n\n48. A.J. Pollock (35, OF, White Sox)\n\nPollock struggled in his first AL season, posting a career-low .292 OBP in 527 plate appearances. He was probably too exposed in Chicago’s lineup and should provide value in a more part-time role, where he might better approach the .355 OBP he produced for the Dodgers in 2021.\n\n49. Matt Carpenter (37, 1B/DH, Yankees)\n\nThe Yankees rescued Carpenter from a minor-league contract with Texas and deployed him to perfection, batting .305 and hitting 15 home runs in 154 plate appearances. Should be an ideal lefty part of a DH platoon somewhere.\n\n50. Jurickson Profar (30, INF/OF, Padres)\n\nProfar played in a career-high 152 games and was a playoff menace, producing a .365 OBP, often out of the leadoff spot. While he’ll never hit for much power, Profar remains a multi-position value for a contending team.\n\n51. Jean Segura (33, INF, Phillies)\n\nSegura broke the majors’ longest streak without reaching the playoffs (1,328 games) and then got the Phillies’ biggest hit, a go-ahead single in their wild-card opener at St. Louis. Segura is a valued veteran and a firmly league average hitter, but Philadelphia is expected to go big at shortstop and move rookie Bryson Stott to second base.\n\n52. Michael Brantley (35, OF, Astros)\n\nCheck back in five decades, when Brantley will wake up from an afternoon nap at the senior center and knock out three hits. He had a .370 OBP before a torn labrum that required shoulder surgery ended his year after 64 games. He will mash, somewhere.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $12 million with Astros, Dec. 18.\n\n53. Mike Clevinger (32, SP, Padres)\n\nFour years after striking out 207 batters, Clevinger remains a curiosity, largely because injuries limited him to 30 starts since 2020. San Diego saw fit to give him two playoff starts and he didn’t record an out in the second one. An incentive-laced deal for a maybe-contender would seem to best benefit both parties.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $12 million with White Sox, Nov. 27.\n\n54. Zack Greinke (39, SP, Royals)\n\nSeems like a Royals reunion is in the works here, unless Greinke and Family decide to become full-time Mariners season-ticket holders. Can Greinke rack up 118 more strikeouts and become the 20th pitcher to exceed 3,000 in a career?\n\n55. David Phelps (36, RP, Blue Jays)\n\nHe took the ball 65 times at age 35, and therein lies Phelps’ value. A 64-31 strikeout-walk ratio won’t get checkbooks rumbling, but Phelps will absorb innings and often in quality fashion, with a 2.83 ERA in 2022.\n\n56. David Peralta (35, OF, Rays)\n\nYou can count on Peralta for 30 doubles a year and slightly better than league average production overall, though his Silver Slugger season of 2018 does seem like a long time ago.\n\n57. Elvis Andrus (35, SS, White Sox)\n\nNext year will mark Andrus’ 15th in the major leagues, all of them spent at shortstop. He and the White Sox got a nice little boost when he arrived in an August trade and Andrus finished as a league average hitter for the first time since 2017.\n\n58. Andrew McCutchen (36, OF, Brewers)\n\nLast year marked a career first for McCutchen: The only season in which his adjusted OPS (99) was less than league average. OK, so just barely, but nonetheless, the former MVP needs a path to viability entering his 15th season after he hit .237 with 17 homers in 515 at-bats and was successful on just 57% of his 14 stolen base attempts.\n\n59. Brandon Belt (34, 1B/DH, Giants)\n\nA dozen years in San Francisco finished roughly for Belt, plagued by injuries and seeing his OPS plummet from .975 to .676. But good health and a fresh start would make him an attractive lefty DH candidate.\n\n60. Trey Mancini (31, 1B/OF, Astros)\n\nProbably best to judge Mancini for the .751 OPS in four months with Baltimore than the .622 mark after a trade to Houston – though he will get a shiny championship ring from the Astros. Still some pop in that bat and always plenty of respect in the clubhouse should a first base/DH timeshare open up for him.\n\n61. Kyle Gibson (35, SP, Phillies)\n\nHe still eats innings with the best of them, but now they taste a little more sour. Gibson produced a 5.05 ERA over 167 ⅔ innings, and his 5.06 ERA in a year and a half with Philly was a run and a half more than his previous year and a half in Texas (3.52). Will take ball, will travel.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $10 million with Orioles, Dec. 5.\n\n62. Carlos Santana (36, DH, Mariners)\n\nSantana is very much in the hired gun stage of his career, what with his OBP dropping from .397 in an All-Star season of 2019 to .316 last year. He did help galvanize the Mariners’ lineup, though, hitting 14 homers in 79 games, and retains value as a lefty-swinging DH.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $6.7 million with Pirates, Nov. 25.\n\n63. Michael Lorenzen (31, SP, Angels)\n\nFor the first time in his career, Lorenzen worked exclusively as a starter and was OK, averaging 5 ⅓ innings per outing with a 4.24 ERA. And that’s what you’ll likely get: A five-ish inning, league average pitcher.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $8.5 million with Tigers, Dec. 14.\n\n64. Tommy Kahnle (33, RP, Dodgers)\n\nL.A. devoted two years to Kahnle’s Tommy John surgery recovery and got 12 appearances out of it, plus three more in the playoffs. But Kahnle did show glimpses why the Dodgers were so intrigued, posting a 0.63 WHIP in his limited runway.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $11.5 million with Yankees, Dec. 6.\n\n65. Matthew Boyd (32, SP, Mariners)\n\nSigned by the Giants in hopes he’d recover from injury to contribute, Boyd instead was shipped to Seattle in August and made 10 relief appearances, posting a 1.35 ERA. Could start or relieve in the future and yes, he’s left-handed.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $10 million with Tigers, Dec. 14.\n\n66. Brad Hand (33, RP, Phillies)\n\nIt’s been an uneven past two seasons for the three-time All-Star, who bobbed in and out of the Phillies’ circle of trust before making seven postseason appearances, five of them scoreless. Likely won’t land a closer gig, but can still take down fairly high-leverage late innings.\n\n67. Brad Boxberger (34, RP, Brewers)\n\nMilwaukee declined a $3 million club option after Boxberger posted nearly identical seasons for them (64 innings, 68 strikeouts, 2.95 ERA in ’22). He’ll probably do about that well on the market and settle in as a set-up man.\n\n68. Craig Kimbrel (34, RP, Dodgers)\n\nThe Craig Conundrum: Kimbrel isn’t comfortable in non-closing situations, but in 2022 was not particularly good as a closer. This left the Dodgers with little choice but keep him off the playoff roster. While he did save 22 games (and blew five others), his 7.7 hits per nine innings made many of them the white-knuckle variety.\n\n69. Joey Gallo (29, OF, Dodgers)\n\nWhile it was convenient for a minute to say Gallo found a comfort level after his trade from New York to L.A., his line with the Dodgers (.162/.277/.393) was just as bad as it was with the Yankees (.159, .282, .339). Still, Gallo’s relative youth and power history (38 homers in 2021) will ensure he gets a DH gig in some form.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $11 million with Twins, Dec. 16.\n\n70. Zach Davies (30, SP, Diamondbacks)\n\nDavies pared his ERA from 5.78 with the Cubs to 4.09 over 27 starts with the Diamondbacks, largely by cutting his walks by nearly a quarter. Rotation-filling fodder.\n\n71. Jace Peterson (32, INF/OF, Brewers)\n\nJust keeps chugging along: Was worth 2.3 WAR last season and should provide positional versatility to his sixth club come 2023.\n\n72. Michael Fulmer (30, RP, Twins)\n\nThe one-time Rookie of the Year is now a usable relief piece, though a career-worst 4.6 walks per nine will dampen his earning power and a shot at high-leverage roles early.\n\n73. Christian Vázquez (32, C, Astros)\n\nAnd so begins the march of respected veteran backstops. Vazquez’s trade left ‘em choked up in the Red Sox dugout and delighted in Houston, where he contributed three hits in 10 at-bats during the ALCS and World Series. A respectable 109 adjusted OPS overall.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $30 million with Twins, Dec. 16.\n\n74. Luke Jackson (31, RP, Braves)\n\nPerhaps a major league guarantee will be too hard to come by, but Jackson finished second in the NL with 31 holds in 2021 before April 2022 Tommy John surgery. With recovery time typically shorter for relievers, a modest multiyear commitment would be a decent gamble on a guy who posted a 1.98 ERA in his most recent season.\n\n75. Taylor Rogers (32, RP, Brewers)\n\nAfter posting a 3.15 ERA and 50 saves in six seasons with Minnesota, the bottom fell out for Rogers after trades to San Diego and Milwaukee, where he combined for a 4.76 ERA. Yet his 1.18 WHIP was in line with his 1.16 mark; a moderate bounce-back seems possible.\n\n76. Josh Harrison (35, INF, White Sox)\n\nEven if lighter in the bat department these days, Harrison played five positions for the White Sox, including pitcher, and provides key roster flexibility along with veteran bona fides.\n\n77. David Robertson (37, RP, Phillies)\n\nRobertson recorded the Phillies’ lone World Series save, capping a year that began with the Cubs. Robertson’s 3.58 FIP is below average for a high-leverage reliever.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $10 million with Mets, Dec. 8.\n\n78. Tucker Barnhart (32, C, Tigers)\n\nWhile his OBP fell to a career-low .287, Barnhart remains a respected receiver and should find a slot in the catching carousel.\n\n79. Will Smith (33, RP, Astros)\n\nSmith saved 37 games and helmed the World Series-winning Night Shift bullpen in Atlanta in 2021, then saw his WHIP spike to 1.41 and was traded to Houston. While Smith made the World Series roster, he did not pitch in the ’22 Series and may need to crawl back from a diminished role to begin ’23.\n\n80. Erasmo Ramirez (32, RP, Nationals)\n\nHe did everything the Nationals asked and did it well, finishing with a 2.92 ERA and 1.08 WHIP in a bullpen often under siege from starters failing to get deep into games.\n\n81. Dylan Bundy (30, SP, Twins)\n\nBundy started 29 games but was hit hard in Minnesota, yielding a 4.89 ERA and nearly 10 hits per nine innings.\n\n82. Robbie Grossman (33, OF, Braves)\n\nWhile Grossman suffered the worst year of his career, he did improve his OPS by 80 points after a trade to Atlanta. A reserve outfielder who can man either corner, has a .346 OBP and occasional sock.\n\n83. Omar Narvaez (31, C, Brewers)\n\nWhile his glimpses of power have vanished (22 homers in 2019, 11 in ’21), Narvaez remains a predictive presence in a catching timeshare.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $15 million with Mets, Dec. 15.\n\n84. Chad Pinder (31, INF/OF, Athletics)\n\nA dash of power and the promise of positional flexibility should afford Pinder a shot elsewhere after becoming the rare player to reach free agency in Oakland before he’s traded.\n\n85. Trevor May (33, RP, Mets)\n\nHad a 5.04 ERA overall but it was 3.24, with a 2.75 FIP, after a three-month absence due to a stress reaction in his humerus. May averaged 12 strikeouts per nine innings with a 3.33 ERA from 2018-21.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $7 million with Athletics, Dec. 16\n\n86.

He’ll get paid\n\nWhatever the price is, the Yankees can pay it. When they declare no one will outbid them, they follow through. This should be one of those times.\n\n2. Captain Judge\n\nOnce secured to a long-term deal, the Yankees can officially grant him the prestigious title of team captain, their first since Derek Jeter.\n\n3. Chance at Yankee immortality\n\nNot to be morbid, but there are only four monuments to Yankees players in Monument Park.\n\n4. No. 99 forever\n\nAt this rate, no one else will wear Judge’s No. 99 again. If he stays a Yankee, there’s almost a certainty that his number is retired.\n\n5. 161st Street and River Avenue\n\nA permanent home address at Yankee Stadium comes with a unique crackling atmosphere, regularly playing before near-capacity crowds.\n\nYANKEES: Aaron Judge’s AL MVP-caliber season is Ruthian in its own right\n\nJUDGE: Home run tracker on the Yankees slugger\n\n6. The All-Rise Foundation\n\nGiving back has always been important to Judge, and a New York base provides more opportunities to expand.\n\n7. A chance at multiple titles\n\nOK, this hasn’t happened in a while. But there’s more reason to expect those results if Judge stays on a club with one of the game’s highest payrolls.\n\n8. The pinstripes\n\nNo other team can match the iconic look of the Yankees uniform. Can you even picture Judge in, say, San Diego Padres green?\n\n9. Broadway\n\nVersus any other boulevard in North America, there’s no contest.\n\n10. Family life\n\nThe New York Metropolitan area offers the best of everything. A great place for newlyweds, like Judge and his wife, to raise a family.\n\n11. The Brand\n\nJudge has his own brand. And that brand is just better as a Yankee.\n\n12. The kids\n\nNot since Jeter has there been a Yankee so popular with their youngest fans, who fill the stands wearing his No. 99. That should mean something to management.\n\n13. Season tickets\n\nAnd the parents of those kids might not be so eager to pay expensive prices to see a Judge-less Yankee team, especially one that falls short again this October.\n\n14. YES Network ratings\n\nJudge is driving a lot of Yankee-related economy. And they’re a much better show when he’s the star attraction.\n\n15. Red Sox Rivalry\n\nJudge knows what it’s like to zap the electricity out of Fenway Park with a big home run. There’s just nothing comparable to Yanks vs. Red Sox.\n\n16. The fanbase\n\nThere’s no one to win over. Judge is the homegrown star of the Yankees, having reached a special elite status. Anywhere else as a free agent, he’s a highly paid import with outsized expectations.\n\n17. Legacy stuff\n\nThey named the West Side Highway after Joe DiMaggio, who only played for one big-league team -- the Yankees.\n\n18. East or West 99th Street\n\nHere’s a chance to name a portion of it, Aaron Judge Drive!\n\n19. Assistant Yankees GM\n\nWith a bigger, longer-term contract comes the bonus of being hooked in on every major acquisition, with input and opinions that count.\n\n20. Not Citi Field\n\nWhen it comes to the city’s MLB parks, only the Bronx offers inviting right field dimensions and the chance at more home runs.\n\n21. Monument Park plaque\n\nLooks like a reality, but less likely with a free-agent exit.\n\n22. Hall of Fame plaque\n\nIf Judge gets to Cooperstown, he’s in a Yankees cap forever. Maybe not, if he signs a 10-year deal with the San Francisco Giants.\n\n23. Northern California\n\nIt’s home to Judge, but the Oakland Athletics won’t be bidding, and San Francisco’s Oracle Park isn’t Yankee Stadium.\n\n24. Multiple chances at a Triple Crown\n\nIn franchise history, only Lou Gehrig (1934) and Mickey Mantle (1956) have done it, and Judge is in the conversation now.\n\n25. Center of the World\n\nThat’s New York City. No place else.\n\n26. Aaron Judge Day\n\nAutomatically happens, at some point, and probably on more than one occasion.\n\n27. Aaron Judge Gate\n\nAn entrance at the Stadium? Sure. Gate 99.\n\n28. Aaron Judge Suite\n\nAlong with the ones named for Jeter, DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, etc.\n\n29. Yankee Royalty\n\nOn future Old-Timers' Days, Judge could enjoy the DiMaggio treatment (Jeter will get this, when he starts appearing), wearing a suit instead of a uniform.\n\n30. Multiple MVPs\n\nAs a Yankee, joining the storied likes of Berra, Mantle and DiMaggio.\n\n31. U.S. Open tennis\n\nJudge was in attendance recently. It’s only played in New York.\n\n32. Transportation\n\nYou can get around better here than in L.A. or Bay Area traffic.\n\n33. Judge’s Chambers\n\nThe Yankees hold the patent on that seating area. Or at least, they can claim it.\n\n34. Law and Order\n\nFilmed on the streets of New York. Rooting for multiple guest shots of Judge as a judge.\n\n35. John Sterling’s home run calls\n\nWho else would you want on the mic for those Judgian blasts!\n\n36. AJ’s Steakhouse\n\nHires a five-star chef and creates the next top-rated restaurant in town.\n\n37. Times Square\n\nJudge once liked the anonymity of walking around unnoticed in a place most New Yorkers avoid.\n\n38. All-Rise high rise\n\nNow, Judge can afford to reside anywhere in Manhattan.\n\n39. Madison Avenue\n\nJudge’s selling power as a pitchman, and a lucrative side income, is just better as a Yankee.\n\n40. Canyon of Heroes\n\nA better, more iconic World Series parade route than Sunset Boulevard.\n\n41. Staten Island, Roosevelt Island, Governor’s Island…\n\nJudge can buy an island here.\n\n42. Postseason awards\n\nSix Yankees position players have claimed a World Series MVP. Judge would be in play to be the seventh.\n\n43. Top jersey\n\nJudge had the top-selling MLB jersey in his first three seasons and has never been out of the top seven.\n\n44. New Jersey\n\nOutside of a new location, would a Judge jersey remain that popular? OK, probably.\n\n45. The Jackie Robinson Museum\n\nRecently opened in New York.\n\n46. New York Awards\n\nYou can only receive the Sid Mercer/Dick Young New York Player of the Year award and the Joe DiMaggio Toast of the Town award (both previously won by Judge) by the New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers’ Association.\n\n47. New York Writers’ Dinner\n\nAnd you can only accept those awards at the famous New York Baseball Writers’ Dinner.\n\n48. New Yankee Stadium\n\nJudge’s 54th homer this year was his 113th at home, tying him with Mark Teixeira for the most at the current Yankee Stadium. When it’s all said and done, Judge might hold every offensive mark at the newer address.\n\n49. Central Park West\n\nIf you’re looking for a great residential address, here it is.\n\n50. SoHo\n\nSame as above.\n\n51. Tribeca\n\nAlso, same as above.\n\n52. Park Slope\n\nThere are other fine places outside of Manhattan. Such as Brooklyn.\n\n53. Alpine, NJ\n\nLet CC Sabathia be your real estate agent.\n\n54. Center field\n\nHallowed real estate in Yankees history and Judge’s most played position in 2022.\n\n55. 'Judge' The Musical\n\nWant a Broadway show about your life and times? Stick around.\n\n56. Homegrown talent\n\nOf all the players drafted and signed by the Yankees, Judge has a chance to have the most home runs from that group by 2023 or 2024.\n\n57. Yankees ownership stake\n\nIt wouldn’t hurt to ask.\n\n58. The City that Never Sleeps\n\nThey don’t say that about Houston.\n\n59. Judge for Mayor of New York\n\nWould probably be a competitive write-in candidacy\n\n60. Passing the Torch\n\nIs there a better ambassador to surpass Maris’ mark, with all the due dignity and reverence for Yankees history, than Judge?\n\n61.

Hurricane-prone Florida and states in the drought-stricken West have seen exceptional population increases in recent decades, researchers say, signaling climate risks are not at the top of people’s minds when it comes to relocating. Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n\n(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\n\n1. Marriage bill\n\nThe House is expected to vote and pass legislation today that would protect same-sex and interracial marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act, which the Senate passed last week in a bipartisan vote, needs to be approved by the House before sending it to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law. The bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, but it would require individual states to recognize another state’s legal marriage. In a sign of how much support has grown in recent years for same-sex marriage, the bill found backing from 12 Republican senators last week, including those in deeply red states.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is “going to take a while,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday as he warned of the “increasing” threat of nuclear war. Putin said he viewed the Russian nuclear arsenal as a deterrent rather than a provocation – but has not dismissed the idea of using nuclear weapons outright. “We have not gone crazy. We are aware of what nuclear weapons are,” Putin said. “We have these means… but we are not going to brandish these weapons like a razor, running around the world.” His comments come as the Biden administration is weighing Ukrainian requests for access to the US stockpile of controversial cluster munitions. These types of scatter weapons are imprecise by design and are banned by more than 100 countries. Still, Russia is using them to devastating effect inside Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Mud, blood, trenches': Ukrainian soldier compares Bakhmut battle to World Wars 03:21 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Power grid attacks\n\nElectricity for thousands of residents in North Carolina has been restored after a dayslong outage caused by targeted gun attacks on power substations. Police say the motive behind the attacks in Moore County remains unknown and no suspects have been announced. However, investigators are zeroing in on two possible threads centered around extremist behavior: writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure, and a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ events across the nation by domestic extremists. Approximately 45,000 homes and businesses initially lost power when the outages occurred on Saturday, leaving residents without heat, running refrigerators or traffic lights for about four days.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police find new evidence in North Carolina power grid attack 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration has appealed a federal court decision that blocked the use of Title 42 – a controversial Trump-era policy allowing for the swift removal of migrants at the US-Mexico border. The authority has been heavily criticized by public health experts and immigrant advocates, and has largely barred asylum at the US-Mexico border. While its origins were in the Trump administration, Title 42 has become a key tool for the Biden administration as it faces mass migration in the Western hemisphere. Officials have been bracing for an influx of migrants when the authority lifts on December 21. The Department of Homeland Security is projecting up to 14,000 migrants may attempt to cross the US southern border per day when the policy is lifted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visits US-Mexico border where migrants wait to cross into US 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations are on the rise in the US, with more than 34,000 new admissions last week – but millions of vaccine doses and antiviral treatments remain unused. The federal government has spent more than $30 billion so far on Covid-19 vaccines and the Biden administration has said it cannot afford to continue this level of spending unless Congress provides it with more funds. As a result, the administration has started to prepare for the transition of the vaccines to the commercial market. Pfizer and Moderna have already announced that the commercial prices of their Covid-19 vaccines will likely be between $82 and $130 per dose – or about three to four times what the federal government has paid.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nHarry and Meghan Netflix documentary released today\n\nEveryone has been waiting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to spill the royal tea.

GM Brian Cashman and crew will “explore every option to try and improve ourselves in anyway we can.\n\n“But I do feel like, if we rolled in where we’re at right now, we have a deep stable of guys who are capable of getting important outs.’’\n\nSleepless nights\n\nBrian Cashman couldn’t acknowledge the yet-to-be-official Gerrit Cole deal, but the Yankees GM did confirm that his cellphone “rang all night’’ Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\nAnd it’s doubly difficult on the West Coast, when most of those calls are coming from the East Coast.\n\n“So, like the night before, Sean Marks texted me at 3 a.m. (to say) good luck at the Winter Meetings,’’ Cashman said of the Brooklyn Nets GM. “I was probably just dozing off.\n\n“I appreciated it (but) it’s hard to sleep when you’re at the Winter Meetings,’’ Cashman said. “It’s actually a very unhealthy environment to be existing in.’’\n\nCoaching staff\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone’s coaching staff essentially complete, with the additions of Matt Blake as pitching coach and Tanner Swanson as the quality control and catching coach.\n\nCarlos Mendoza replaces Josh Bard (now the Dodgers bullpen coach) as bench coach. Mendoza will continue to serve as an infield instructor.\n\nFirst base coach Reggie Willits, third base coach Phil Nevin, bullpen coach Mike Harkey and hitting coaches Marcus Thames and P.J. Pilittere will return in their roles.\n\nThe Yankees will also be adding a coaching assistant/bullpen catcher to team with Radley Haddad.\n\nPitching coach Larry Rothschild (now with the Padres) and catching coach Jason Brown were let go after the season.\n\nWith Blake, 33, “we wanted a fresh voice in there,’’ said Boone, who said the candidates went through “a pretty rigorous process. (And we are) really good excited about what we saw from Matt and his potential and the impact he’s already had,’’ in playing “a big role’’ as the Cleveland Indians director of pitching development.\n\n“We feel like he has a chance to really grow into being special in this position,’’ Boone said.\n\nMendoza is “an elite coach’’ and his elevation to bench coach was “something deserved,’’ said Boone.\n\nFormerly a catching instructor in the Minnesota Twins’ organization, Swanson had been on the Yankees radar for about a year and is seen as “a rising star as a catching coach,’’ with attributes in game-planning and coordination that go beyond his coaching skills.\n\nTuesday, Dec. 10\n\nBrett Gardner reunion?\n\nYes, the Yankees are \"laser focused'' on the Gerrit Cole free agent negotiations, but GM Brian Cashman has other irons in the fire, like talks with Brett Gardner's reps.\n\nIt just seems like most other Yankees business is on hold until Cole is settled.\n\nRight now, Cashman is concentrated on “the most obvious way to improve the club,’’ which is the Cole pursuit.\n\nAnd every indication is that Gardner wants to re-up with the Yankees, too, though he's likely to get just one year and there are reports of possible multi-year offers from other clubs for the 36-year-old coming off one of his strongest seasons.\n\nWith Aaron Hicks (Tommy John surgery) possibly out until the second half of 2020, center field is an area the club will also explore via free agency and trade.\n\n\"Obviously Gardy is still out there and someone we hope we want to bring back,'' said manager Aaron Boone. \"And that goes a long way there.''\n\nBoone's center field depth chart is currently led by Mike Tauchman, a defensively capable player who'd be the Yankees' only regular lefty hitter now that Didi Gregorius is bound for Philadelphia.\n\nGood guy, Stephen Strasburg\n\nThough they figured he’d wind up back in Washington, the Yankees came away impressed by Stephen Strasburg in their meeting last week, the day after visiting Gerrit Cole.\n\n“What a good guy,’’ Cashman said of Strasburg. “I always had anticipated that he’d return to Washington regardless, but I was really thoroughly impressed with him as a person.’’\n\nBut, of course, “our focus has been Cole.’’\n\nScott Boras speaks\n\nIt's the annual highlight lobby event of the Winter Meetings: Super agent Scott Boras has spoken.\n\nWhen asked about the chance of a swift resolution in the Gerrit Cole talks with multiple clubs (now up to 5?), Boras said \"we’re certainly well into the negotiation process to where you can say you can potentially see a finish line.\n\n\"As to how long that takes, I’m not sure. I’ll just say that we're actively negotiating with a good number of teams.''\n\nThe Yankees, Angels and Dodgers you know about.\n\nAnd now, you guessed it, there are two \"mystery teams'' in the mix as well.\n\n\"You always get clubs that call. With very aggressive moves in this area,'' Boras said. He did not name those new entries in the Cole sweepstakes (hence, the mystery).\n\nBut the Phillies, White Sox, Rangers, Astros and maybe even the Giants or Padres could be one of the Masked Teams.\n\nMonday, Dec. 9\n\nMiguel Andujar & the third base market\n\nPart of the ripple effect from the Washington Nationals' $245 million, seven-year agreement to reunite with right-hander Stephen Strasburg is how it might impact the third base market.\n\nThe Nationals would appear to be a less realistic option to re-sign free agent Anthony Rendon, whose price tag could exceed $260 million.\n\nHowever, Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo suggested on Monday that his club was still in play for Rendon, due to the structure of Strasburg's new deal.\n\nJosh Donaldson is also out there in free agency, looking at a big payday, and the Nats, Phillies, Rangers, Dodgers and Braves are in the picture.\n\nAnd the clubs who either miss out, or can't play on the likes of Rendon and Donaldson might inquire on the Yankees' Miguel Andujar.\n\nAndujar could be the centerpiece to a deal that returns controllable starting pitching - though it's a commodity easier bought in free agency.\n\nFor now, it's hard to properly gauge Andujar's market, coming off a lost 2019 season due to right labrum surgery.\n\nPlus, his future as a third baseman is clouded due to defensive shortcomings.\n\nWith Gio Urshela, a superior defender, set to enter spring training as the incumbent third baseman, the Yankees have discussed trying Andujar at first base and left field during camp.\n\nIn this market, Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant remains an attractive trade option.\n\nYankees' own free agents\n\nBrett Gardner’s stated preference to remain in pinstripes, and the Yankees’ need for center field depth ought to be incentive enough to reach agreement on another one-year deal.\n\nHowever, there are some clubs floating multi-year discussions for the current longest-tenured Yankee, according to MLB Network’s Jon Heyman, via Twitter.\n\nTalks between the Yanks and Gardner’s reps continue, and Gardner has the leverage of coming off a fine offensive season with no signs of slowing down at age 36.\n\nBut if the Yankees are seeking alternatives, and if shortstop Didi Gregorius isn’t coming back, the Dodgers’ versatile Enrique Hernandez could be an available option.\n\nUSA Today’s Bob Nightengale reported that the Dodgers would listen on Hernandez, who can play center field as well as in the infield, and who stands to earn over $5 million in his final arbitration year.\n\nGregorius has been tied to interest by the Phillies and Reds, with Heyman reporting that a three-year deal in the $45 million range could be a reasonable get for the lefty-hitting shortstop.\n\nAt this point, the Yankees haven't shown much interest beyond monitoring the markets for Gregorius, setup man Dellin Betances and backup catcher Austin Romine.\n\nNew Phillies manager Joe Girardi has a history with Gregorius and Betances, having managed both in New York, and Girardi didn't downplay Philadelphia's needs.\n\n\"We are looking at everybody,'' said Girardi, whose club recently signed Mets free agent starter Zack Wheeler.\n\nCheck back throughout the week for updates...\n\nPete Caldera is the Yankees beat writer for NorthJersey.com.

Raphael Warnock remains undefeated.\n\nAfter being pushed to another runoff in November, the Democrat asked voters in Georgia to put him over the top “one more time” in December – and, once again, they delivered.\n\nSince November 2020, Warnock has been the leading vote-getter in four consecutive Georgia Senate elections. But because of state law requiring statewide candidates to get a majority to win a general election, Warnock had to double the feat in both his 2020 special election and his 2022 bid for a full six-year term.\n\nHis victory in this head-to-head contest with Republican nominee Herschel Walker means Democrats will add to their already-secured Senate majority, with 51 seats to the GOP’s 49, and solidify the Peach State as a potentially decisive 2024 presidential battleground.\n\nAs the 2022 midterm cycle spins to its end, here are five takeaways from this final election night in Georgia.\n\n51st seat gives Democrats true majority\n\nDemocrats had already clinched control of the Senate, with 50 seats secured last month, which would allow Vice President Kamala Harris to cast the tie-breaking vote as she does now. But winning a 51st seat, thanks to Warnock’s victory Tuesday, comes with important benefits for the Democrats running the Senate and for President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nThe party will now enter 2023 with a true Senate majority – one that won’t require the power-sharing agreement that has been in place over the last two years in an evenly divided chamber. That outright majority means that Democrats will have the majority on committees, allowing them to advance Biden’s nominees more easily.\n\nFor example: The Senate Judiciary Committee, with its 22 members, will shift from a split of 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans to 12 Democrats and 10 Republicans. That removes a GOP procedural mechanism to slow down the confirmation of Biden’s judicial nominees.\n\nDemocratic leaders, meanwhile, face a reduced risk that a single senator can hold its priorities hostage, since the party can now afford to lose a vote. Harris, who has already cast the third-most tie-breaking votes of any vice president, and the most since John Calhoun nearly 200 years ago, would be less tied to Capitol Hill.\n\nIt’s also an early boost to Democrats ahead of a 2024 election in which the party will have to defend several seats in deep-red states, including West Virginia and Montana, to maintain its majority.\n\nGeorgia is a swing state until further notice\n\nAs long as former President Donald Trump remains an influential figure in Republican politics, Georgia is poised to be a crucial Election Day battleground – especially when federal offices are on the ballot.\n\nIf there was any doubt before Tuesday, it’s been erased now.\n\nWalker was Trump’s hand-picked candidate to take on Warnock and he flamed out despite first running on a ticket with a popular Republican governor and then, this time, with that same governor’s express endorsement and support on the campaign trail.\n\nKemp’s inability to pull Walker over the finish line says less about him – or even Walker, a flawed candidate in any setting – than the state’s shifting partisan alignment. Changing demographics, an evolving economy and strategic, tenacious organizing by Democrats have made a beacon of the Old South a legitimate swing state.\n\nOn now to 2024.\n\nThe Democratic turnout machine strikes again\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Georgia Republicans passed a controversial law that, among other things, reduced the amount of time between a November election and potential runoff, creating a condensed timeline that narrowed the window for mail-in voters and reduced the number of days to vote early in-person.\n\nIt didn’t matter.\n\nThe Democratic turnout machine in Georgia over the past four weeks – with a running start that goes back years and owes heavily to the groundwork by Stacey Abrams and her allies – once again delivered in a hotly contested race that attracted tens of millions of dollars in spending by the campaigns and national organizations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Magic Wall: How Warnock beat Walker in Georgia 01:16 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile the ultimate number of votes cast remains to be seen, early in-person turnout ahead of this year’s runoff was down from 2021. That’s because the new law reduced the period between votes from nine weeks to four. But it was still strong, with the state’s single-day early voting record repeatedly broken during the final week of pre-election day balloting.\n\nTurnout was especially robust in key Democratic strongholds, including larger metro areas and the suburbs that have shaded blue following former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016. Six years later, Georgia is not only a symbol of Trump’s apparent drag on the GOP, but a model for Democrats seeking to capitalize on it.\n\nTrump fumbles another Senate seat\n\nTrump tried to use the 2022 midterms to pack congressional majorities and statehouses with allies who owed their offices to Trump’s endorsement ahead of his third run for the White House. Instead, he backed a series of flawed, controversial candidates who lost races the GOP expected to win. Walker on Tuesday night joined a list that includes Blake Masters in Arizona and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, as well as gubernatorial losers such as Kari Lake in Arizona, Tim Michels in Wisconsin, Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-Trump White House official says Trump is liable for Walker's loss 01:21 - Source: CNN\n\nNo Republican presidential candidate had lost Georgia since 1992. But with Trump up for reelection, Democrats won the presidency in 2020 and both of the state’s Senate seats in 2021 runoffs. Then, this year, they won a Senate seat again, defeating a candidate pushed into the race by the former president.\n\nThe losses have immediate implications: Trump has already launched his 2024 presidential bid. Every loss by a Republican pushed by Trump is likely to enrage donors, embolden potential rivals and erode the confidence of GOP voters in Trump’s political potency.\n\nThe blame game that began four weeks ago will continue after Walker’s loss, and is likely to amplify calls for the GOP to turn elsewhere for leadership.\n\nKemp can’t convince the ticket-splitters\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp kept his distance from Walker as he coasted to reelection in this year’s rematch with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams – winning 2.1 million votes, about 200,000 more than Walker won against Warnock in November.\n\nAfter his victory, though, Kemp more fully embraced his party’s Senate nominee, despite the governor’s bad blood with Trump.\n\nKemp’s goal was to convince some of those tens of thousands of ticket-splitters to support the GOP nominee in the runoff. He appeared with Walker at rallies, cut television ads for the former University of Georgia football star and even loaned the get-out-the-vote operation that helped propel him to victory to a Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell-aligned super PAC to boost Walker.\n\nIt was a stark contrast from the approach taken by Trump, who held a tele-rally for Walker on the eve of the election but did little else to help in the runoff. And if Walker had won, it would have been Kemp that deserved a large share of the credit.\n\nHowever, Georgia’s runoff proved a lesson that former President Barack Obama and, later, Trump, had to learn: Voters’ support often isn’t transferrable. And without Kemp on the ballot, many of the same moderate suburbanites who rejected Walker in November did so again in the runoff.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Eric Bradner", "Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/georgia-senate-runoff-voting/index.html", "title": "Raphael Warnock will win Georgia Senate runoff, CNN projects, in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock will win Georgia’s Senate runoff, CNN projects, giving Democrats greater leverage in the Senate next year and delivering a critical blow to former President Donald Trump after a defeat of yet another one of his hand-picked candidates.\n\nWith Warnock’s defeat of Republican challenger Herschel Walker, Democrats will control 51 seats to the GOP’s 49.\n\nThe race closes out a difficult midterm cycle for Republicans – who won the House majority but saw their hopes for Capitol Hill dominance dashed by the troubled candidacies of some Trump-backed Senate nominees.\n\n“There are no excuses in life and I’m not going to make any excuses now because we put up one heck of a fight,” Walker told supporters after calling Warnock.\n\nThe runoff was a final midterm test of the former president’s influence as he embarks on a third White House bid. It was also a sign that – in the wake of President Joe Biden narrowly carrying the state in 2020, combined with two Senate runoff wins that handed him a Democratic Senate in 2021 – Georgia is now definitively a purple state.\n\nIn his victory speech, Warnock alluded to the fact that the runoff was his fourth campaign in two years. “After a hard-fought campaign – or should I say campaigns – it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: The people have spoken.”\n\n“I often say that a vote is a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and for our children,” Warnock continued. “You have put in the hard work and here we are standing together.”\n\nThe president called Warnock after arriving back in Washington from an event in Arizona and tweeted: “Tonight Georgia voters stood up for our democracy, rejected Ultra MAGAism, and most importantly: sent a good man back to the Senate. Here’s to six more years.”\n\nThe recriminations arrived swiftly for the GOP late Tuesday night.\n\n“The only way to explain this is candidate quality,” Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan said on CNN, noting the delta between Gov. Brian Kemp’s November victory and where it appears that Walker will end up when all the votes are counted.\n\nHe said he hoped Warnock’s victory would serve as a wake-up call for the GOP. “If we don’t take our medicine here, it’s our fault. … Every Republican in this country ought to hold Donald Trump accountable for this.”\n\nMany Republicans attributed the closeness of the race on Tuesday night to the fact that Kemp came to Walker’s rescue in the runoff after keeping his distance during last month’s general election. He not only campaigned for him but put the muscle of his own turnout operation into efforts to help the GOP Senate nominee.\n\nMorale among Walker’s campaign staff hit an all-time low in its final days as it became clear to them their candidate would likely lose his race to Warnock, according to multiple people familiar with his campaign.\n\nSeveral of Walker’s staff members became frustrated as the runoff election progressed over the last month, sensing their advice for the embattled candidate wasn’t being heeded as outside voices with little political experience were empowered.\n\nIn addition to dealing with a slew of scandals, Walker’s campaign tried to adjust his message to more closely align with the successful one Kemp ran on, but ultimately felt their candidate declined to take strategic advice, was reluctant to hit the campaign trail and largely declined media interviews in the final days.\n\n“He’s so proud he doesn’t like taking advice,” one person familiar with the campaign told CNN, adding that he instead leaned on his wife Julie Blanchard for most decisions rather than empowering his team.\n\nWin expands Democrats’ Senate majority\n\nDemocratic control of the Senate next year was already settled by hard-fought contests in states like Nevada, where Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto clung to her seat despite economic headwinds, and in Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman picked up a GOP-held seat.\n\nThe Senate has been evenly divided 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes. That has given inordinate power to moderate figures like Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who have often single-handedly curbed the ambitions of their party. Warnock securing a full six-year term will allow Democrats to dispense with the current power-sharing agreement with Republicans, while making it easier to advance Biden’s nominees.\n\nBiden and his advisers have been keenly aware of what a significant difference the single extra seat can make. “It means a lot,” is how one Democrat familiar with the White House’s thinking put it very simply.\n\nThough Warnock gained more votes than Walker in last month’s general election, he did not earn the majority needed to win outright. The ensuing runoff had attracted more than $80 million in ad spending, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact, with Democrats spending about twice as much as Republicans.\n\nWarnock held a narrow lead over Walker in a CNN poll released last week. Walker had a negative favorability rating as voters questioned his honesty after a series of scandals. He’s denied reports that he pressured or encouraged women to have abortions, despite previously advocating for bans on the procedure without exceptions on the campaign trail. CNN’s KFile has reported that he is getting a tax break intended only for a primary residence this year on his home in the Dallas, Texas, area – while running for the seat in Georgia.\n\nThe state broke single-day early voting records last week, but the early voting period was significantly condensed from 2021. The overall number of voters decreased from roughly 3.1 million last year to about 1.87 million in 2022. Democrats were optimistic, in part, because of Black voters – who strongly favored Warnock in CNN’s poll. They accounted for nearly 32% of the turnout in early voting, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nWalker, however, was counting on robust turnout among GOP voters, who tend to vote in greater numbers on Election Day.\n\nBut Trump – who, like Biden, steered clear of the Peach State during the runoff – complicated GOP fortunes across the country this year as voters rejected many of his election-denying candidates in swing states.\n\nSome of the earliest signs of that were in Georgia two years ago, when his efforts to raise doubts about mail-in ballots and vote counting were blamed, in part, for the GOP’s 2021 losses in twin runoffs that handed Democrats control of the Senate.\n\nThis year, the former president’s efforts to exact revenge on Kemp – who rebuffed Trump’s demands to overturn the 2020 election – were soundly rejected by voters in the primary. Kemp went on to handily defeat Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams last month, garnering about 200,000 more votes than Walker.\n\nAfter watching losses in key states like Arizona and Pennsylvania, top Republicans are planning a more aggressive push to prop up candidates in primaries that they deem as more electable. The incoming chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Montana Sen. Steve Daines, told CNN: “Clearly you want to see candidates who can win general elections and we’re gonna keep working that in.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/06/georgia-senate-runoff-live-updates-warnock-walker/10839609002/", "title": "Georgia runoff: Raphael Warnock wins, beating Herschel Walker", "text": "Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate run-off Tuesday, expanding his party's majority in the chamber and giving them more power to confirm judges and promote legislation.\n\nDemocrats had already secured control of the Senate with wins in last month's general elections; Warnock's runoff victory gives them a 51st vote, making it easier for the party to push President Joe Biden's agenda in the face of the incoming Republican majority in the U.S. House.\n\nWhile much congressional deadlock between the chambers is likely, the 51-seat majority does give Democrats more control of Senate committees and frees them from reliance on Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking votes.\n\nThe Senate also has the sole authority to confirm judges and other president appointments.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nGeorgia Senate runoff: Football icon Herschel Walker, Sen.

And after a hard fought campaign, or should I say campaigns, it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy — the people have spoken.”\n\nWarnock recounted his family history, including how his mother grew up picking cotton and his father supported the family hauling cars, and his own history growing up in Savannah.\n\n“I am Georgia,” he said. “I am an example and an iteration of its history, of its pain and its promise, of the brutality and the possibility. But because this is America and because we always have a path to make our country greater against unspeakable odds, thank you Georgia.”\n\nWarnock said that his victory was not evidence that voter suppression does not exist in Georgia but that instead it was an indicator that voters had managed to overcome it. He highlighted several policy issues – lowering prescription drug prices, creating jobs, and working on criminal justice reform. And he thanked his staff and volunteers.\n\n“After a hard fought campaign, you got me for six more years,” he said.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\nTakeaways from the runoff\n\nOne of the most expensive and bitter Senate contests ended with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock prevailing over Republican challenger Herschel Walker on Tuesday.\n\nThe Georgia race, which cost $380 million in total, did not change which party controlled the Senate in the upcoming Congress, but it did underscore how deeply and evenly the country is divided going into 2023.\n\nFor months the race was a tale of major contrasts as Warnock, a Baptist preacher, and Walker, a former NFL star, were opposites in experience, political beliefs and speaking styles.\n\nRead the whole story here:5 takeaways from the Georgia Senate runoff between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWalker: 'not going to make any excuses'\n\nWalker said running for senator was the best thing he's ever done in his concession speech around 11 p.m. ET.\n\n\"There are no excuses in life,\" Walker said. \"I'm not going to make any excuses now.\"\n\nWalker urged those in attendance to support their elected officials and to \"stay together, don't let anyone separate you.\"\n\n-- Will Peebles\n\nMood darkens at Walker HQ as vote count nears end\n\nAs the vote count neared completion Tuesday night around 10 p.m., the crowd at Walker's watch party were on a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nThe Fox News live count of the race on the projected screen at the front of the room fluctuated back and forth as the close race tilted to Walker, then back to Warnock.\n\nCheers erupt, then the crowd falls silent, a couple of times every 10 minutes or so.\n\nBut as the night wound down, and Warnock's lead extended to about 30,000 votes, the silence began to persist.\n\n-- Will Peebles\n\nMore:Warnock win gives Democrats 51-seat Senate majority in 2022 midterms overtime battle\n\nWarnock wins in Georgia runoff\n\nDemocratic incumbent Raphael Warnock won the runoff race for Georgia's Senate seat.\n\nCNN and NBC first reported his win, with the Associated Press and others following sho.\n\nDemocrats already locked Senate majority last month, but had hoped for a greater margin and more legislative power, especially in committees.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans hoped to make the Senate a 50/50 split to keep some level of power, especially in committees.\n\nTonight's result marks the end of an extra-long election process, after neither candidate won more than 50% of the vote in November and the race went into a runoff.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nBiden predicts Democratic win in Georgia\n\nAs the country waits for the final tally in the Georgia runoff, President Joe Biden isn’t.\n\n\"We're going to win,” he said. “We're going to win Georgia.”\n\nThe president was speaking to reporters after exiting Air Force One.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nCountry music star sets tone at Walker party\n\nAs Georgia-born country music artist Andy Velo, the opening musical act of the Walker watch party, was playing “Friends in Low Places” around 8:40 p.m. Tuesday night, the crowd erupted in applause.\n\nBut it wasn’t just for Velo. The crowd was watching the results, displayed on a giant screen playing Fox News behind Velo. Walker, who had been trailing Warnock from the start of the night, finally caught up in the close race.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, that’s your hard work right there,” Velo said, as he began playing an original song.\n\nThe timbre of the room changed entirely. What before was a fairly reserved party became energized, as Walker supporters cheered together and hugged each other.\n\nAt that point, about 1.8 million ballots of 3.3 million total had been counted.\n\n-- Will Peebles\n\nTraveling to campaign\n\nMichael A.

Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker remain uncalled, an hour and a half after polls closed in Georgia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nWarnock is currently leading Walker in voting, 52.2% -- 47.8%, with nearly 50% of ballots counted at 8:23 p.m. ET.\n\nDave Wasserman, editor at the Cook Political Report, said the race will come down to a close margin. “At this point, turnout in metro Atlanta would need to be unusually rough for Warnock (D) to lose,” Wasserman tweeted Tuesday night.\n\n-- Mabinty Quarshie\n\nNo matter who wins, history will be made\n\nWhoever voters choose Tuesday, Georgia is set to elect its first Black senator to a full six-year term.\n\nWarnock is already in the Peach State's history books as the state's first Black senator after beating Republican Kelly Loeffler in the 2021 runoff.\n\nThat made the Atlanta minister—who is pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. presided—just the 11th Black senator in U.S. history, but that was to finish out the term of Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned in 2019.\n\nIf Walker wins, the former NFL running back would be the 12th Black senator in U.S. history.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nGeorgia polls close\n\nIt's official: The Georgia Senate runoff is over, with polls closing at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nNow the political world waits to evaluate the results of the high-profile race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker.\n\nIf one of the candidates breaks away, the race could be called as early as 10 or 11 p.m.; a tight race, and we could be waiting until after midnight.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWarnock campaign 'feeling really good' ahead of polls closing\n\nWarnock’s campaign is confident as the polls are about to close, according to Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson, founder and CEO of Paramount Consulting Group. Speaking at the Warnock election night gathering, Johnson said that key precincts are trending the right way for the senator.\n\n“Feeling really good about the turnout because our campaign has spent an enormous amount of time talking to all voters across the state of Georgia,” he said. “The early vote numbers were really good, and we’re proud of the Georgia voters that decided to go out and vote early.”\n\nAs for what is bringing voters back to the polls after the primary and general election earlier this year, Johnson said it is nothing less than democracy.\n\n“We have a group of people on the Republican side who are focused on trying to move us backwards as a country,” he said. “And people in Georgia, they realize how important it is we send Sen. Warnock back to Washington.”\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\nRunoff turnout exhausts paper supply\n\nAs Georgia headed into its final hour of the run-off election Tuesday, precinct 4-08 at Wilmington Island Presbyterian Church saw more than 1,100 ballots cast, according to poll manager Ashley Reed.\n\nDuring the primaries on Nov. 8, the same precinct saw 862 voters the entire day.\n\n“I’ve never had turnout like this for a runoff,” the 27-year veteran of elections work said. “We’re running out of paper.”\n\nReed added that more paper was on its way, and the precinct experienced a few machine hiccups during the day, but nothing that kept people from voting.\n\nThe ballot scanner stopped working, and by the time they’d received a new one, Reed said she had to scan a backlog of 200 ballots into the machine. “But everybody got counted,” she said.\n\nReed said the shorter time for early voting is what drove people out to vote on Election Day this week, along with the importance of the outcome— which would either clinch already assured Democratic control of the Senate, or narrow the already thin margin of political control should the Republicans succeed.\n\n“The entire country hinges on this one,” she said of the election.\n\n-- Zoe Nicholson\n\nWarnock watch event prepped and ready\n\nSupporters of Sen. Warnock are gathering at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in downtown Atlanta, less than a mile from where Walker is gathering supporters.\n\nA TV behind the Warnock campaign podium is already playing CNN coverage of the election, an hour before polls close.

Walker was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nWalker's watch party is officially set to begin at 7 p.m., and campaign staffers said other guests of Walker should start to arrive around then.\n\nUSA TODAY Network Georgia reporters will be providing updates from both Walker's watch party and Incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock's watch party throughout the night.\n\n-- Will Peebles\n\nFor progressives, Georgia could be a Manchin-Sinema ‘insurance policy’\n\nGeorgia’s runoff won’t change which party controls the Senate, but progressive activists have one big reason for wanting Democrats to get a 51-seat majority on Tuesday.\n\nThose at the grassroots level told USA TODAY that taking Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona—two more conservative-leaning members of the caucus—down a notch is a major motivation.\n\n“It does give you a little bit of insurance policy,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, an Atlanta-based voting rights group, said.\n\n“For Georgia voters, for some Black Georgia voters in particular, they're very much aware of that,” he added. “They view getting this seat to getting closer to making those two less relevant.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat is a runoff election?:Georgians head to the polls for Warnock v. Walker round two.\n\nEarly voting updates\n\nFinal data from election night won’t be available for a while, but Georgia has been updating the early voting data in real time.\n\nBefore election day, Georgia had accepted about 175,000 absentee ballots and 1.7 million people had voted early in person – a total of 1.89 million ballots, or 27% of registered voters.\n\nWhite voters had the highest number of votes among early voters, but Black voters had slightly higher early voting turnout at 29.5% - a full percentage point higher than white voters. About 10% of voters under 30 voted early, while 49.5% of registered voters 65 and above had already voted by election day.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\nDems look to young voters for Warnock's success\n\nMaxwell Frost, Democratic Representative-elect and the first Gen. Z member of Congress, appeared on the University of Georgia campus today to encourage students there to go vote.\n\n\"I gotta tell y’all… I’m feeling really good about the youth turnout in Georgia,\" Frost wrote in a tweet.\n\nVoters 29 and under had a large turnout earlier this year in the general election, with the second highest participation rate in decades. A majority of these voters cast their ballots for Democrats in November.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWalker, Warnock make final pitch to voters\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Republican challenger Herschel Walker barnstormed Georgia Tuesday in their final stops of a long midterm campaign cycle, with both of them stressing the importance of high turnout.\n\nThat was especially true in parts of the state where rain was in the forecast.\n\n“Rain is not an excuse to not vote. Rain is not an excuse to not show up,” Warnock said in a video Tuesday shared thousands of times on social media. “If you stand with me, I will stand with you – in the rain, in the snow, in the sleet, the hail. I’ll show up for you every time.”\n\nWalker, who has been buoyed by his football fame, said he loves “winning championships” and predicted a victory for himself in Georgia, focusing on turnout Tuesday. “I love y’all, and we’re gonna win this election.”\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nNo Donald Trump sightings in Georgia runoff\n\nThe Georgia Senate runoff has come and nearly gone, with one notable absence: Donald Trump.\n\nTrump never did travel to Georgia to campaign for protege Herschel Walker, much to the relief of Republicans who said the former president would have probably done more harm than good – as appeared to have happened during runoff races in the state in early 2021.\n\nIn midterms election a month ago, Trump-backed, election-denying Republicans lost key Senate and other statewide races in important states like Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nThis time around in Georgia, Trump was relegated to a \"tele-rally\" for Walker on Monday night and posts on Truth Social.\n\n\"To the Great State of Georgia, Get Out and Vote for the WONDERFUL Herschel Walker,\" Trump posted.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGov. Kemp continues raising support for Walker\n\nGov. Brian Kemp encouraged Georgia voters to go out and vote for Herschel Walker, as he said he already had, in a video posted to Twitter this morning.\n\n\"We got to have a big turnout today to win this thing. Let's get it done and send someone like Herschel to the United State Senate that is going to fight for us,\" Kemp said in the forty-second video.\n\nDuring his own campaign for reelection earlier this year, Kemp kept more distance between himself and Walker, not publicly supporting the Republican Senate candidate the way he has since Nov. 8. He made his first appearance with Walker on Nov. 19 during a rally northwest of Atlanta.\n\nWith Walker coming into today polling slightly behind his opponent, his best shot at success may very well be Kemp. The popular governor could help mobilize voters, especially more moderate Republicans, who did not turn out for Walker a month ago.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Herschel Walker?\n\nRepublican challenger Herschel Walker is a former college and National Football League player. The 60-year-old Georgia native entered the race for Senate as one of former President Donald Trump's hand-selected candidates. The George Senate race is Walker's first political campaign.\n\nA staunch anti-abortion rights candidate, Walker faced controversy just weeks before the general election when an ex-girlfriend told the Daily Beast he had paid for her abortion in 2009 and later urged her to have a second one. Walker denied her allegations, along with those from a second woman who said she was also pressured by the Senate candidate to have an abortion.\n\nWalker has maintained a strict position against abortion access, including in cases of rape or incest, identifying himself as “pro-life” on his campaign website. He has run on a platform of energy independence as a means to reduce oil and gas prices, along with saying he will \"defend, not defund, the police.\"\n\n-- Rachel Looker, Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow much has been spent on runoff election?\n\nThe Georgia Senate race is the most expensive race of the midterm season, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nSuper PACs spent nearly $16 million more on Warnock than his Republican challenger Herschel Walker ahead of the runoff election, spending more than $40 million on expenses like advertisements supporting Warnock or opposing Walker. Other PACs spent more than $24 million supporting Walker or opposing Warnock, according to filings reported to the Federal Elections Commission.\n\nMoney is mainly being used to purchase TV ads, digital and online communications and on-the-ground canvassing.\n\n-- Rachel Looker, Mabinty Quarshie, Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy is there a runoff election? And could tonight's runoff go to a recount?\n\nOn election night, Sen. Raphael Warnock was up about 1 percentage point over Herschel Walker – not enough to avoid a runoff, with the Libertarian drawing 2% of the vote, but enough to avoid a recount in Georgia.\n\nAccording to Georgia’s recount law, losing candidates have the right to a recount from the secretary of state if they are within half a percentage point of the winner after the results are certified.\n\nThere is also a procedure if an election administrator or candidate believes that there has been an error in the count.

Voters will head to the polls today.\n\nWhat is a runoff election?\n\nSimilar to a political tiebreaker, a runoff election is a second contest held when no candidate wins the majority of votes in a general election.\n\nIn Georgia, runoffs are held four weeks after a general election when the top two candidates did not earn more than 50% of the vote. A candidate has to earn the majority of votes to win in a runoff election.\n\nBoth Georgia Senate candidates Walker and Warnock did not meet the 50% vote threshold on Nov. 8, with Warnock leading Walker by more than 30,000 votes – earning 49.4% of total votes. Walker earned 48.5% and the remaining 2.1% went to libertarian candidate Chase Oliver, triggering the runoff.\n\nAnyone who is registered to vote can cast a ballot in a runoff election.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWho is Sen. Raphael Warnock?\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, 53, was first elected to Congress in 2020 after winning a special election runoff to fill a vacant seat. Born in Savannah, Georgia, the senator has served as a pastor for over 16 years at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the former church of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nWarnock has dubbed himself a \"pro-choice pastor,\" according to his campaign website, and has criticized the Supreme Court for overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent has emphasized the need to fight for criminal justice reform measures while funding the police. He is an advocate for Medicaid expansion and capping the cost of insulin and prescriptions.\n\nWarnock believes access to education shouldn't depend on zip codes and has advocated to lower the cost of higher education, fighting for student loan forgiveness.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWarnock vs. Walker: From toss-up to leans Democratic\n\nPolls continue to show Warnock and Walker locked in a tight race that could go either way, but some political forecasters are giving the Democrats an edge.\n\nThe Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, a newsletter that analyzes campaigns, moved Georgia from a \"toss-up\" to \"leans Democratic\" state on Monday.\n\nIt noted that Georgia remains a competitive state, but that \"most indicators point to a Warnock advantage\" including the early voting data and that Democrats are heavily outspending Republicans.\n\n\"If Warnock ends up winning... we can all agree on one thing: He will have certainly earned a full term. Over the span of 2 years, Warnock ran a gauntlet of 4 high-stakes races,\" J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor of the newsletter, said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWarnock vs. Walker: Saturday voting and runoff timeframe\n\nGeorgia was embroiled in one of the more controversial voting rights battles the Republican-controlled state legislature changed the election rules in early 2021.\n\nAmong the biggest changes that had an impact on the Dec. 6 special election under the measure, known as SB 202, was shortening the runoff election from nine weeks to four weeks, and cutting early voting from 17 days to five.\n\nAnother fight created by the new law was over Saturday voting.\n\nInitially, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office suggested Georgia counties had the option to provide Saturday voting on Nov. 26.\n\nBut later the office said there would be no Saturday voting, citing its interpretation of SB 202, which prevents early in-person voting being held on any Saturday that comes after a holiday on a Thursday or Friday.\n\nDemocrats, including the Warnock campaign, pounced on Raffensperger's office and quickly filed suit against the decision. A judge, and eventually an appeals court, ruled against the GOP in court and allowed voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\n\n— Phillip M.

Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker on December 6, CNN projects.\n\nNeither candidate surpassed the 50% threshold to win the race outright on Tuesday. Depending on the outcome of Senate races in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, voters in Georgia could then – for the second consecutive election cycle – have the Senate majority in their hands.\n\nThat the race was so tight underscores the prevalence of ticket-splitters in Georgia this year. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp comfortably defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams, CNN projected, but Walker has lagged Kemp’s margin all night, while Warnock has outpaced Abrams.\n\nIn brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”\n\n“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.\n\nWarnock has not yet addressed the crowd at his election night headquarters.

Raphael Warnock defeats Republican challenger Herschel Walker in a Georgia runoff next month.\n\nBut there are other key races for other offices that are still outstanding.\n\nWhich party reaches the 218 seats necessary for a House majority will hinge on races in states with a large share of mail-in ballots – including California, where identifying winners in some races could take weeks, Oregon and Arizona.\n\nAnother high-profile contest remains too close to call: The Arizona governor’s race – where Republican Kari Lake, the Donald Trump-supported election denier, is facing Democratic secretary of state Katie Hobbs, a defender of the state’s election process.\n\nA Democratic upset keeps House majority hopes alive\n\nThe political world’s eyes are now on the battle for control of the House, where Republicans appear to be slowly inching toward a narrow majority but Democrats’ hopes have not yet fully faded.\n\nRepublicans have won 211 of the 218 seats they’d need to take the majority, according to CNN projections, while Democrats have won 204, with 20 undecided as of Saturday evening.\n\nDemocrats scored a major coup in Washington’s Republican-leaning 3rd District, where on Saturday CNN projected that Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez would defeat Republican Joe Kent, who had aligned himself closely with former President Donald Trump.\n\nHer victory came largely as a result of Trump’s efforts to punish Republicans who voted to impeach him. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a moderate who was widely viewed as a lock for reelection, did not finish in one of the top two slots in the primary and therefore didn’t advance to the general election.\n\nMany of the undecided races are in California, where counting mail-in ballots can take weeks and significant shifts can occur late in that process. Other states with large quantities of mail-in ballots, including Arizona and Oregon, also have undecided races.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate makeup of both chambers next year, Republicans’ lackluster midterm performance has prompted a backlash against House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nSenate win also boosts Biden’s power\n\nIn retaining their Senate majority, Democrats defied the historical trend of midterm elections breaking against parties in power and overcame anxiety about high inflation. Instead, voters punished Republicans who had opposed abortion rights and parroted Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\nThe outcome is a huge boost to President Joe Biden over the remaining two years of his first term in the White House. It means Democrats will have the ability to confirm Biden’s judicial nominees – avoiding scenarios such as the one former President Barack Obama faced in 2016, when then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to hold a vote on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. It also means that Senate Democrats can reject bills passed by the House and can set their own agenda.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took a victory lap late Saturday night, saying that voters had vindicated Democrats’ agenda.\n\nHe said the Democratic Senate candidates “beat some very flawed challengers who had no faith in democracy, no fidelity to truth or honor. And even when the polls looked bleak, our candidates never gave up and never lost faith.”\n\nHe also touted Democrats’ ability to block any GOP measures that would ban abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade.\n\n“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there’s now a firewall against a nationwide abortion ban threat that so many Republicans have talked about,” he said.\n\nAnother Georgia Senate runoff\n\nSenate control already being settled will take some of the national spotlight – and the television advertising spending – away from the Senate runoff in Georgia.\n\nBut the December 6 race between Warnock and Walker is still important. A win would give Democrats a meaningful majority, rather than the power-sharing agreement currently in place with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaker in the 50-50 chamber. It would also give them a pad ahead of a 2024 Senate battle in which the party must defend several seats in states that typically back Republican presidential candidates.\n\n“It’s just simply better. The bigger the number the better,” Biden, who is in the midst of an international trip, told reporters in Cambodia shortly after CNN and other news outlets projected Democrats would keep their Senate majority.\n\nWarnock’s campaign had already launched a television advertisement laying out the stakes for the runoff.\n\n“It’s about who has the competence and character to represent us; who’s willing to tell the truth; who has the knowledge needed for the job,” a narrator says in the spot.\n\nIt’s the second straight election in which overtime in Georgia, which is triggered when no candidate tops 50% of the vote in the general election, will be necessary.\n\nIn 2021, Democrats swept two Georgia Senate runoffs – Jon Ossoff’s race against then-Sen. David Perdue and Raphael Warnock’s match-up with then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler had been appointed to the Senate in 2019 when former Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Warnock defeated her in the special election for the remainder of Isakson’s term.\n\nNow, Warnock faces Walker, the former University of Georgia football star backed by Trump, in a race for a full six-year term.\n\nArizona governor among key races still undecided\n\nThe Arizona governor’s race between Lake, one of the most prominent election deniers on the ballot this year, and Hobbs, remains tight, with Hobbs clinging to a 34,000 vote lead as of late Saturday with an estimated 290,000 votes to be counted.\n\nIf she wins, Lake would be a rare Trump-supported election denier to win a competitive statewide race this year. Other Republicans who had parroted Trump’s falsehoods about widespread election frauds lost governor’s races in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and secretary of state races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and more.\n\nIn an interview with CNN Saturday afternoon, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said that about 190,000 votes remain to be counted in Maricopa County.\n\nHe said he was confident that about 95% to 99% of those votes will be recorded by Tuesday. He said the county will continue to report about 85,000 votes per night until they are done.\n\nIt’s perhaps the most closely watched race that’s too close to call. But several other key races are also undecided.\n\nIn Alaska, the state’s at-large House seat and one of its Senate seats will hinge on ranked-choice results. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, who won a special election this summer, is in a strong position to eclipse the 50% mark. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski faces a stiffer challenge from Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who is backed by Trump as part of his bid for retribution against Murkowski and others who for his impeachment after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Rep. Karen Bass on Saturday widened her lead over developer Rick Caruso in the mayor’s race.\n\nElection officials push back on disinformation\n\nOfficials in Arizona and Nevada continued to push back on election misinformation about the vote counting that was spread online by right-wing activists and by Trump on his Truth Social platform. Trump baselessly posted on Truth Social Friday night that Clark County, which is the most populous in Nevada, was “finding all sorts of ballots in Clark County” and “pulling out all stops to steal the Election from Adam Laxalt.”\n\nClark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria refuted Trump’s claim during a news conference on Saturday. In Nevada, ballots postmarked on Election Day could be counted as long as they arrived by Saturday.\n\n“We’re taking ballots in that we’re required to take in according to the law, there’s no way that we can find ballots,” Gloria said. “They’re brought here by the United States Postal Service. As long as it’s postmarked [by Election Day], we process those ballots and put them in the count.”\n\nLaxalt struck a different tone than Trump Saturday. Shortly before the Saturday evening ballot drop from Clark County, Laxalt was leading Cortez Masto by a mere 862 votes.\n\nStill, Laxalt acknowledged in a tweet Saturday morning that the mail-in ballots that had arrived over the past couple of days continued to break in higher Democratic margins than his team had calculated. “This has narrowed our victory window,” he tweeted. He said the race was coming down to the more than 20,000 Election Day Clark County drop-off ballots. “If they are GOP precincts or slightly DEM leaning then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy DEM then she will overtake us.”\n\nUnderscoring the closeness of the race, Laxalt put out a series of tweets Saturday evening encouraging voters to “cure” their ballots to ensure that any ballots with technical errors with signature or other issues could be fixed to ensure they are counted. The deadline to cure ballots is 5 p.m. on Monday.\n\nIn Arizona, where CNN has projected that Sen. Mark Kelly will win reelection, GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters took a different approach – tweeting Saturday that all the votes should be counted before anyone predicts the outcome (even though Kelly continued to lead him by a significant margin).\n\n“For my people who knocked doors in 115 degree heat, and for the million+ Arizonans who put their faith in me, we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted,” Masters tweeted. “If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let’s count the votes.”\n\nMaricopa County Election officials pushed back on Masters’ earlier contention – one that Lake had also made – that the vote counting in Arizona was moving too slowly in Arizona’s most populous county.\n\n“It’s really, really unfortunate that some candidates, some activists are deciding to spread this misinformation,” Gates told CNN’s Jim Acosta. “We have spent weeks at Maricopa County, getting that word out that people should not anticipate results on election night or even the next day. That it does take this long.”\n\nGates added that candidates and activists who were stating that the count was taking too long have not been “paying attention to the history of how we have counted votes here in Arizona for decades now. The average time over the last couple of decades to get through our count is 10 to 12 days.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Maeve Reston", "Eric Bradner", "Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/24/primaries-georgia-texas-alabama-arkansas-live-updates/9570676002/", "title": "Primary results in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas: live updates", "text": "It was a night of bad news for Donald Trump: key politicians – Brian Kemp and Brad Raffensperger in Georgia and Mo Brooke in Alabama – he had snubbed or actively opposed won important victories Tuesday in what could be a sign the former president's grip on the party is loosening further.\n\nGeorgia Gov.

Flowers faced a small business owner, Hollie McCormack, and a former Rome city commissioner, Wendy Davis, in the district’s Democratic primary.\n\nHours before the Associated Press called the race in Flowers’ favor, he deemed himself the primary winner, writing on Twitter “on November 8th, I will unseat Marjorie Taylor Greene.”\n\n- Ella Lee, Associated Press\n\nIncumbent v. incumbent: Rep.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose penchant for conspiracy theories and fiery social media posts made her a far-right fan favorite, won her renomination bid to represent Georgia’s 14th Congressional District for another two years.\n\nBut the Georgia congresswoman almost didn’t get to run at all.\n\nA group of Georgia voters sought to disqualify Greene from running for office, citing her purported ties to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and calling them violation of the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause. Greene loudly disputed those charges and said during a hearing about her eligibility that she had \"no knowledge\" of any attempt to unlawfully interfere with the electoral process.\n\nThe claims were dismissed by Georgia’s secretary of state and an administrative law judge.\n\nGreene will likely face Democrat Marcus Flowers in the state’s midterm election, who is currently leading his primary.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nKemp camp hopeful GOP will unite against Abrams\n\nAs Kemp backers started to celebrate, they expressed confidence - or at least hope - that the Georgia Republicans (and Trump) would come together in the fall to defeat Abrams.\n\nMark Hamilton, 66, an Atlanta resident and a former aide to Kemp, said he and other Republicans like and respect Trump, but \"at the same time, Gov, Kemp is our governor, and we support him.\"\n\nKemp backers said they weren't sure if Trump would now endorse him, but they expect at least Perdue to work for the governor's re-election.\n\nNo one will out-work Brian Kemp, let's put it that way,\" said Terry Rogers, 68, a political consultant from Clarksville, Ga.\n\nThe Uvalde, Texas school massacre put a damper on the festivities.

Typically, Kruger said she votes for Democrats.\n\nFellow Georgia State University Professor Deirdre Oakley said she also considered voting in the Republican primary despite being a Democrat. But when it came time to cast a vote, Oakley stuck with the Democratic candidate.\n\n“I just couldn’t do that when I walked in there,” Oakley said.\n\n– Caty Buchaniec and Julia Shapero, Medill News Service\n\nTrump-backed Herschel Walker, former football star, wins primary race\n\nFormer football celebrity Herschel Walker will challenge incumbent Sen.

The former football star is running for Senate in Georgia as a Republican.\n\nWarnock was Georgia’s first Black Senator, and Walker is also Black. Though Georgia will have another African American Senator no matter which candidate wins, Warnock and Walker have vastly different views of what it means to be Black in America. While Warnock has been outspoken on racial issues, Walker has downplayed the effects of racism in America.\n\nThe contest between Walker and Warnock could be tight, with RealClearPolitics’ latest polling data between the pair placing Walker a half point ahead of incumbent Warnock. But claims of stalking and abuse by Walker’s past partners and other women could upend his bid for office in the coming months.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nSen.

So far, only Democrat Stacey Abrams’ primary bid for governor has been called in her favor. She will face either Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp or former Sen. David Perdue, who is backed by former President Donald Trump. Kemp is favored to win.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s primary race is also underway, along with the Senate contest between incumbent Rep.

Democrats will be defending 23 of them, compared to 10 for the Republicans. Even before we consider potential retirements and the like, the slate of seats look daunting for Democrats.\n\nWhereas the party didn’t have to defend a single seat in a state former President Donald Trump won in 2020 this election cycle, in 2024 they will have to defend three seats – Montana, Ohio and West Virginia – where Trump won. Republicans, on the other hand, have no incumbents up in 2024 sitting in seats that Joe Biden won in 2020.\n\nLet’s look at the potentially troublesome seats for Democrats – starting with three Trump carried in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\n* Montana: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is in his third term, but he’s never had a truly easy race – having won with roughly 49% twice and 50% in 2018, a good year for Democrats nationally. Tester hasn’t announced whether he will run again, but either way, Republicans will be targeting the state. Rep. Matt Rosendale, who lost to Tester by three points in 2018, is mentioned as a possible candidate, as in Rep.-elect Ryan Zinke.\n\n* Ohio: As Rep. Tim Ryan just proved, it’s very hard to win statewide as a Democrat in increasingly red Ohio. But Sen. Sherrod Brown has seemed to be able to crack that code in past races, winning with 53% in 2018 and 51% in 2012. But Republican J.D. Vance’s win in Ohio this year will undoubtedly embolden Republicans who have long eyed Brown for defeat. Among the names mentioned as possible candidates include Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Attorney General Dave Yost and state Sen. Matt Dolan.\n\n* West Virginia: Sen. Joe Manchin is a Democrat sitting in a state that Trump carried by 39 points in 2020. And unlike his last reelection bid in 2018, the presidential race will be at the top of the ticket – likely driving people further into their partisan corners. That’s bad news for Manchin, who relies on the votes of independents and Republican to win. And Republicans are already lining up for the chance to take on Manchin. In September, Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat-turned-Republican, said he is considering a run against Manchin. And Rep. Alex Mooney even ran ads during the 2022 campaign bashing Manchin for supporting the Inflation Reduction Act. Manchin is the only Democrat who would have a chance of holding this seat, but even his grip on it is tenuous in a presidential year in West Virginia.\n\nBeyond those three seats, there are plenty of other possible problems for Democrats on the map.\n\nThere’s Arizona, where Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who won with 50% of the vote and could face a primary challenge from Rep. Ruben Gallego, is channeling liberals’ unhappiness with how she has voted in her first term.\n\nAnd in neighboring Nevada, Sen. Jacky Rosen is up for a second term. She won in 2018 with 50% of the vote, and given the long history of close statewide races in Nevada, has to be considered potentially vulnerable as well.\n\nSens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania all sit in states that are expected to be hotly contested at the presidential level.\n\nThe problem for Democrats isn’t just that they have a lot of vulnerability on their side of the aisle in 2024. It’s that Republicans have almost none.\n\nThe two best pickup opportunities for Democrats are in Florida and Texas. But after the shellacking that Democrats took in Florida last Tuesday, Sen. Rick Scott has to be feeling pretty confident. Ditto Texas Sen. John Cornyn after 2022 proved, again, that races in the state are still the Republicans’ to lose.\n\nThe point is this: Democrats need to gain every seat they can from the 2022 election cycle. Holding the Senate this year is a massive achievement, but keeping it again in two years’ time will be a gargantuan task. Democrats would much rather start the 2024 cycle with a bit of cushion provided by a Warnock win.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/politics/georgia-senate-runoff-final-push/index.html", "title": "Warnock and Walker make final push in high-stakes Georgia Senate ...", "text": "Atlanta CNN —\n\nOn the final day of overtime in Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock exuded confidence, but warned supporters against being complacent in his runoff election with Republican nominee and former football great Herschel Walker.\n\n“There is still a path for Herschel Walker to win this race,” Warnock said after a campaign stop here Monday. “If there’s anything I worry about it’s that people will think we don’t need their voice. We do. We need you to show up.”\n\nWarnock was the leading vote-getter in the general election last month, but the contest extended into December since he failed to win a majority. After four weeks of runoff campaigning, Warnock and Democrats are optimistic that he can outlast Walker and secure a full, six-year term. Such a victory would help solidify Georgia as a purple state after Joe Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and Warnock and Jon Ossoff won January 2021 runoffs that delivered the president a Democratic Senate.\n\nTuesday’s race, though, is still expected to be tight, with both parties and allied groups pouring tens of millions into a contest that will shape the balance of power in the Senate over the next two years.\n\nDemocrats have already clinched control of the chamber, but victory for Warnock – after the party picked up a seat in Pennsylvania – would give Majority Leader Chuck Schumer a vote to spare and allow Democrats to lead committees that have been split since Biden took office. With that in mind, Walker and a host of GOP senators have implored Republicans to send him to Washington as a check on Biden and his policies.\n\n“We’re working on turnout, turnout, turnout,” Walker said as he barnstormed across northern Georgia at five scheduled rallies on the eve of the election. “A vote for Warnock is a vote for these failed policies. A vote for me is a better coming.”\n\nDuring a campaign rally for Warnock in Atlanta last week, former President Barack Obama stressed the immediate impact of Democrats potentially winning a 51st Senate seat. “It prevents one person from holding up everything,” he said, while also looking ahead to the next election and its implications.\n\n“It also puts us in a better position a couple years from now when you’ve got another election and the Senate map is going to be tilted in the favor of Republicans,” Obama said. “And it’ll help prevent Republicans from getting a filibuster-proof majority that could allow them to do things like passing a federal abortion ban.”\n\nThe turnout question\n\nIn the final act of the 2022 midterm election, Georgia voters once again have the last word.\n\nFor the past few weeks, Georgia Republican leaders have been touting early in-person voting turnout. That’s despite GOP officials having sought unsuccessfully to close the polls on the Saturday after Thanksgiving owing to a controversial reading of state voting laws. The Georgia Supreme Court ultimately upheld a lower court’s ruling that allowed them to open.\n\nOn Friday, the state broke its single-day record, again, when more than 350,000 people went to the polls to cast ballots before Election Day.\n\nBut those figures, though impressive, came during an early voting period that had been significantly condensed from 2021. Though several days last week ended with historically high numbers of ballots cast, the overall number of voters ahead of this runoff – as compared to the 2021 election – actually decreased, from roughly 3.1 million last year to about 1.87 million in 2022. (About 2.5 million voted before Election Day last month.)\n\nDespite the uncertainty some Democrats feel around turnout, especially given an ugly weather forecast for Tuesday, Walker faces steep challenges in money and math.\n\nDemocrats have more than doubled GOP ad spending over the last month alone, according to a CNN analysis of data from AdImpact. Democrats have spent an astonishing $55 million to the GOP’s $26 million on TV spots since November 9.\n\nWalker is also scrambling to overcome an extraordinary 200,000-vote gap between his November vote total and that of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who handily defeated Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. That’s a deficit complicating Walker’s path as he looks to win over Republican or Republican-leaning voters who didn’t turn out for him last month.\n\nYet his GOP supporters are keeping hope alive.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of people who are sorry they didn’t get out and vote last time,” said Elizabeth Walters, a retiree who came to see Walker at a weekend stop in Loganville. “I think it might be close, but I think he’ll win.”\n\nThe optimism is far more muted in many Republican circles in Washington, where a mix of dissatisfaction and disappointment are directed at the Walker campaign and former President Donald Trump, who recruited him to run.\n\nTrump steered clear of Georgia, but held a tele-rally on Monday night to rally his supporters.\n\n“If Herschel wins this race Republicans can make Chuck Schumer’s life a little more difficult and we can slam on the brakes on every extreme left-wing judge and everything else that’s happening right now for the last two years, been happening to our country,” Trump said in remarks that lasted less than 10 minutes.\n\n“We’re in dire straits in this nation,” said John Hayes, a Republican voter who watched Walker campaign at a weekend stop. “I think there will be a lot of Republicans who come out to vote on Tuesday. That’s what we need.”\n\nKemp has done his best to aid the cause after stiff-arming Walker for most of the general election campaign. With Trump effectively out of the picture, Kemp has emerged as Walker’s top surrogate, appearing in a pair of television ads during the runoff for his fellow Republican.\n\nVictory for Walker would be a boon for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the coming Congress. And Trump, ignoring all evidence that his involvement complicated the GOP’s path here, would surely claim vindication.\n\nBut the most profound effect of a Walker win could be bolstering Kemp’s national stature. After defeating a Trump-backed primary challenger last spring and being reelected by a wide margin last month, he is the rare high-profile Republican to publicly reject Trump’s lies about a stolen 2020 election and maintain, if not grow, his popularity with the GOP base.\n\nKids and cross-over voters\n\nFurther underscoring the growing strength of Kemp’s brand has been Warnock’s effort to reinforce and grow his support among so-called crossover voters. In the run-up to the runoff, Warnock debuted an ad spotlighting voters who said they had backed Kemp and plan to do the same for Warnock on Tuesday.\n\nBut in the final sprint, the Democrat has also been seeking to energize the young voters who, over the past two cycles, have emerged as increasingly crucial parts of the party’s coalition.\n\nAt Georgia Tech on Monday, Warnock urged students who had not already cast ballots to get out on Tuesday – and asked that they encourage their friends and family to do the same.\n\n“I want you to know that your assignment, if you’ve already voted, your assignment is not yet done. Your assignment is to get some more of your friends,” Warnock said. “Call Lottie, Dottie, and everybody. Tell them it’s time to vote.”\n\nWarnock was introduced by Florida Rep.-elect Maxwell Frost, who will become the first Gen-Z member of Congress.\n\n“We know that young people don’t make up the biggest voting bloc right now,” Frost said, “but we are the bloc that matters.”", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Eva Mckend Gregory Krieg", "Jeff Zeleny", "Eva Mckend", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterms-election-senate-control-races-live-updates/8257921001/", "title": "Senate races: Fetterman, Vance, Hassan win; Georgia, Arizona ...", "text": "As Election Day turned to Wednesday, it remained unclear when the election results would be known in the U.S. Senate race in Georgia, a contest that could determine whether Democrats keep control of the Senate.\n\n\"We are not sure if this journey is over tonight, or if there's still a little work to do,\" Democratic Sen.

He has since said he believes Biden won the election, but has changed that position multiple times. Hassan said Tuesday morning Bolduc had been \"working to cast doubt” on the election process during the campaign.\n\n“I don’t know why she’s worried about it. She feels the elections are safe and secure, so why is she worrying about something she already believes in?” Bolduc said. “I’m not going to lose. I’m going to win.

Kelly has been vocal about her support for abortion rights, while Schmidt has said he wants fewer abortions but respects the decision made by the state’s voters.\n\nWhile the candidates were split on a number of hot-button social issues like school curricula and transgender participation in sports, the driving theme of the race was the economy, with both Kelly and Schmidt pitching themselves as the right remedy for tough times.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nGeorgia Senate race heads to runoff\n\nGeorgia's U.S. Senate race will go to a runoff, according to complete vote counts on the state's website that show Democratic incumbent Sen.

The inability for one candidate to claim a majority — 50% plus one vote — forces the runoff. All precincts have reported.\n\nThe final tally affirmed what an official with the Georgia Secretary of State's office announced via Twitter shortly after 2 a.m. Wednesday, that it was \"safe to say\" there will be a runoff for the U.S. Senate.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore, Savannah Now\n\nDems take full control of Michigan Legislature for first time in decades\n\nDemocrats powered their way to control of the Michigan House and Senate in Tuesday's election, marking the first time the party secured a majority of seats in both legislative chambers in nearly 40 years.\n\nThe shift is perhaps the starkest sign Michigan voters rejected the “red wave” predicted by Republicans, instead opting for Democrats in more competitive races shaped largely by redistricting.\n\nThe Associated Press had not confirmed the results of each race, but current Republican leaders in both the House and Senate acknowledged they lost power and their Democratic counterparts have claimed victory.\n\nWhile the margins are narrow, Tuesday's midterm election gives newly reelected Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's party power in the state's upper and lower chambers. That paves the way to any number of policies Whitmer and fellow Democrats failed to make headway on during the governor's first term and for the years prior in Lansing.\n\n- Dave Boucher, Detroit Free Press\n\nMichael Lawler defeats NY Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney\n\nGOP candidate Michael Lawler unseated Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y., who serves as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in a suburban New York City district that President Joe Biden won easily in the 2020 election.\n\nThe campaign drew intense interest from national political funders, who spent $8.8 million to oppose Maloney and $3.7 million to oppose Lawler, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nMaloney, a five-term House member, is the second straight DCCC chair to face a challenging reelection.\n\nTed Cruz to campaign for Herschel Walker in Georgia\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will campaign for Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker on Thursday in the runoff election scheduled for Dec. 6.\n\nThe event will happen in Cherokee County, where Walker captured 67.6% of the votes in Tuesday’s election, according to returns from the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.\n\nWalker faces incumbent Democratic Sen.

Ron Johnson projected winner of Wisconsin U.S. Senate race\n\nIncumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is the projected winner of the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, defeating the state’s Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, according to CNN, ABC News and NBC News.\n\nA marquee race targeted by both sides for capturing Senate control, the contest was expected to be close, although most polling in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s election favored Johnson, according to FiveThirtyEight. A Marquette University Law School poll last week had Johnson up 50%-48%.\n\n\"I want to thank my family and everyone who supported me and worked so hard to save this U.S. Senate seat,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"I will do everything I can to help make things better for Wisconsinites and to heal and unify our country.\"\n\nJohnson, a former plastics company executive first elected during the anti-establishment Republican Tea Party wave of 2010, has been one of Trump’s biggest supporters in the Senate.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nHere's what else to know about Election Day 2022:\n\nSlow vote counting in Nevada\n\nNevada's two most populous counties, Washoe, home to Reno in the north, and Clark County, home to Las Vegas in the south , were still counting tens of thousands of outstanding ballots as of 10 am pacific time.\n\n“Our message is that mail-in ballots are our new normal, and we will all have to understand that it will take several days to properly process and count mail-in ballots,” said Beth Drysdale, a spokeswoman for Washoe County, which hoped to process about 20,000 ballots on Wednesday. “It's extremely important that we follow every step to account for every ballot. We will not rush the results.”\n\nState Republican party officials on Tuesday night criticized both counties for the delay in processing ballots, saying they should have been better prepared. Democrats have been sanguine about the slow pace.\n\n- Trevor Hughes\n\nElection officials on Georgia Senate recount: It’s happening\n\nAt least Georgia election officials have a sense of humor.\n\nSecretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s family endured death threats when he refused former President Trump’s entreaties to “find” him votes in 2020. His top deputy Gabriel Sterling had to proffer explanations day after day to shoot down conspiracy theories pushed by Trump and his legal team to try and baselessly overturn the results.\n\nAnd yet, this week, facing another election with nationwide implications and a Trump-backed U.S. Senate candidate in a squeaky tight race, former NFL star Herschel Walker, Sterling in the wee hours took to Twitter to say, well, bring it.\n\n“While county officials are still doing the detailed work on counting the votes, we feel it is safe to say there will be a runoff for the US Senate here in Georgia slated for December 6,” he tweeted, accompanied by a GIF of fans watching a game in a bar with an all-CAPS caption. “THE ONLY THING THAT COULD MAKE THIS ANY BETTER IS OVERTIME.\" Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock is leading Walker by only 36,000 votes – within a single percentage-point margin.\n\nThere may be another reason for levity in Sterling’s office, though. Raffensperger won reelection yesterday by a nearly 10-point margin.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nSluggish vote counting, slim leads: What’s going on with governors’ races?\n\nFour governor’s races are too close to call as of midday Wednesday, with some sluggish vote counting and Democrats clinging to a slim leads in Kansas and Oregon.

Her father, Mike Huckabee, previously served as the state’s governor from 1996 to 2007.\n\n“I know it will be the honor of a lifetime to serve as Arkansas’ 47th governor and the first female governor,” Sanders said, to an elated crowd at her election night watch party.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn California, House Democrats are playing defense\n\nControl of the House is being held up in part because of a few tight races in California with Democrats largely on the defensive.\n\nIn southern California, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, champion for progressives, is neck and neck with Republican Scott Baugh, at 50.3%-49.7% with half of the votes still yet to be counted.\n\nJust south of Porter's seat, the same goes for Democratic Rep. Mike Levin, who is leading Republican Bryan Maryott by only two percentage points at 51%-49% with more than half of the votes still outstanding.\n\nAnd an anti-Trump Republican in central California who voted to impeach the former president, Rep. David Valadao, is fending off a competitive challenge from California assemblyman and top Democrat recruit, Rudy Salas. Valadao has an eight percentage point lead at 54%-46%, but that’s with only 31% of the votes counted so far.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky defeats anti-abortion amendment proposal\n\nKentucky's proposed amendment to its state constitution that would've ended the right to an abortion was defeated at the ballot box, making Kentucky the second state to reject such an effort, following Kansas.\n\n\"This is a historic win for the people of Kentucky,\" Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Protect Kentucky Access, said in a statement released just after midnight. \"Not only does it represent a win against government overreach and government interference in the people of Kentucky’s personal medical decisions, it represents the first time so many different organizations have come together with such an intense single-minded purpose to defeat a threat of this magnitude.\"\n\nThe Associated Press called the race Wednesday morning after about 86% of votes had been counted, with about 53% of voters against it and about 47% for it.\n\n– Deborah Yetter, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nOregon governor's race is too close to call, with Tina Kotek ahead\n\nSALEM, Ore. – Democrat Tina Kotek held a razor thin lead over Republican Christine Drazan in the Oregon governor’s race all night Tuesday, but the race remained too close to call.\n\nIn a short speech at 11 p.m. Kotek thanked her supporters, saying that it was too early to call the race.\n\nDrazan took the stage to thank supporters about a half hour later, and expressed confidence that Republicans would hold the seat when all the votes are counted.\n\nBetsy Johnson, who ran as an independent, conceded early in the evening.\n\n– Tracy Loew, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nLindsey Graham: It’s not Trump, it’s Biden\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham says it’s too soon to tell where all the chips will fall, but he knows one thing for certain.\n\n“(It’s) definitely not a Republican wave – that's for darn sure,” the South Carolina Republican said on NBC News late Tuesday.\n\nHe suggested he didn’t want to engage in a premature post-mortem of what Republicans should have done differently. But Graham, a close ally of former President Donald Trump, said he didn’t believe Trump’s campaigning with Republicans damaged their chances.\n\n“Not really,” he said. “I think it was a referendum on Biden.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nDemocratic House campaign chief trailing in New York\n\nWhile Democrats have managed to run better so far than many dire predictions would have it, the head of their campaign arm in the House is facing uncertain re-election chances this morning.\n\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney is trailing Republican challenger Michael Lawler 49.4% to 50.6%. That was with roughly 95% of the votes counted in their New York district. The race is still too close to call.\n\nMaloney, a former senior adviser to former President Bill Clinton, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That group – and others trying to elect Democrats – took some heat for spending money during primary races to boost hard-right Trump-backed Republican candidates, ostensibly helping to boost weaker opponents for Democrats.\n\n“My job is to win elections for the Democrats,” Maloney said on “Meet the Press” in August. “I understand that there are difficult moral questions, philosophical questions about tactics. That's always true in politics.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nIn Arizona Senate race, Kelly had the lead\n\nArizona's Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly was maintaining a lead early Wednesday over Republican Blake Masters, with a sizable edge among early votes cast in Maricopa and Pima counties.\n\nUnofficial ballot returns earlier Tuesday reflected those cast during the state’s early voting period and were Democratic-leaning as many expected. Republicans are expected to dominate ballots counted later, suggesting Kelly's hold on the race is tenuous.\n\nKelly now faces the challenge of trying to hold onto that advantage as counting shifts to Election Day votes and those dropped off in recent days. That process is expected to continue for days.\n\n– Arizona Republic\n\nElection Day roundup:Texas GOP Gov. Abbott, Colorado Sen. Bennet reelected. Here's what you might have missed in the midterms\n\nFirebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert facing unexpectedly tight race\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., had a 97% chance of winning reelection against Democrat Adam Frisch, analysts at FiveThirtyEight predicted before the polls opened Tuesday. A day later, that prediction may be a little in doubt.\n\nBoebert, known for a gun-themed restaurant – Shooters – she once owned and incendiary remarks about Muslims, among others, was trailing Frisch with 49.1% compared to his 50.9%. That tally was with 92.53% of the votes counted.\n\nFrisch, a former city council member, ran on the economy and his campaign says he knows “creating good-paying jobs and fighting inflation must be the top priorities for our representative, not sideshow theatrics.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nGeorgia keeping us waiting…again\n\nWith neither candidate in the U.S. Senate race in Georgia getting more than 50% of the vote so far, the contest could be headed to a runoff in December. Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock had 49.4%, while Republican challenger Herschel Walker had 48.5% with an estimated 2% of votes still outstanding early Wednesday morning.\n\nIf it goes to a runoff, that will be held four weeks after this week’s election, meaning it would fall on Dec. 6. Early voting for a runoff would start next week, on Nov. 14. USA TODAY’s Anna Kaufman breaks down more of the ins and outs here, including explaining what a runoff election is and who’s eligible.\n\nGeorgia kept the nation in suspense in 2020, too, when both Senate races there went to runoffs and were decided in January 2021, tipping Senate control to Democrats.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nWhere does Congress stand?\n\nAs of 7 a.m., neither party can claim control of a chamber of Congress.\n\nIn the Senate, there are five seats oustanding: Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Nevada are too close to call. Alaska's ranked-choice voting system means results may not be final for up to two more weeks. A party needs 51 seats to have the majority. Right now, the Senate is evenly split, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking ties.\n\nIn the House, Republicans needed to gain five seats to acquire the majority. Right now, there are 64 seats without a decision.\n\n– Katie Wadington\n\nKathy Hochul becomes NY's first elected female governor\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul held off a Republican challenger backed by party heavyweights eager to turn Andrew Cuomo’s downfall into victory in a reliably blue state, rallying downstate voters to become the first woman elected governor of New York. The Buffalo-born Hochul, 64, also becomes the first upstate governor in a century, dating back to Nathan Miller, who took office in 1921.\n\nWith nearly 93% of the vote counted, Hochul was leading Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Trump supporter and military veteran from Long Island who played on voter fears of random violence to cast Hochul as a soft-on-crime Democrat. Hochul garnered 52.7% of the vote.\n\n–LoHud.com\n\nIn Arizona gubernatorial race, Hobbs leading Lake\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial hopeful Katie Hobbs was ahead of Republican Kari Lake in early election results released Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.\n\nThe race between Lake, a former TV news anchor, and Hobbs, the outgoing secretary of state and former lawmaker, had been labeled a toss-up by some polls and analysts.\n\nWith 62.39% of the vote counted, Hobbs has 50.9% of the vote to Lake's 49.1%.\n\n– Arizona Republic\n\nJohnson has narrow edge in Wisconsin Senate race\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes were locked in a race that was too close to call early Wednesday.\n\nWith 93% of the vote in, Johnson had 50.7% of the vote to 49.3% for Barnes, a difference of nearly 40,000 votes.\n\n\"We've looked very closely at the numbers,\" Johnson told supporters in Neenah. \"We feel confident there's no way they can make up the gap.\" He added that he expected to declare victory later in the morning.\n\nBarnes campaign spokeswoman Maddy McDaniel said in a statement: “We always knew this race would be incredibly close. No matter what anyone says, we are committed to making sure every vote is counted.

Bee Nguyen.\n\nRaffensperger held a solid lead over Nguyen in the polls throughout the race. The contest to be the state’s chief election officer, a down-ballot race that has previously garnered little attention, has gained increased importance in the wake of the 2020 election and unfounded voter fraud claims.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep.

However, Harris is the first vice president-elect to be given the title.\n\n\"It is one of my responsibilities,\" Harris told the magazine of her place in history. \"My mother had many sayings. She would say, 'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things; make sure you’re not the last.' Which is why (in my victory speech), I said, 'I will be the first, but I will not be the last.'

In bestowing that honor, Time magazine said Trump's victory shook up the U.S. political scene, for better or worse.\n\n\"For those who believe this is all for the better, Trump’s victory represents a long-overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class; for those who see it as for the worse, the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse, a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism, sexism, nativism,\" the magazine said.\n\nTime added: \"To his believers, he delivers change — broad, deep, historic change, not modest measures doled out in Dixie cups; to his detractors, he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name.\"\n\nTime has named a Person of the Year since 1927, and more often than not, elected and reelected presidents are given the title during an election year.\n\nBarack Obama won the title in both 2008 and 2012, and George W. Bush won in 2004 and 2000. Bill Clinton was awarded the title in 1992 and in 1998, though he shared the latter title with Ken Starr, who headed the investigation into Clinton's real estate investments. The first president to win the award was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.\n\nFact check:Altered image makes false claim about Time magazine's Person of the Year\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nA social media post that presents an image of President Donald Trump as Time magazine's \"Person of the Year\" is MISSING CONTEXT because it may be misleading without additional information.

They were “just a few of the many people that have had their lives altered forever because of the events of early Tuesday morning.”\n\nThe shooting is under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and Anderson is on leave, Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe case follows a spate of deadly, controversial police encounters with Black Americans that have sparked protests nationwide, including in Columbus, where a series of killings by law enforcement have happened since 2020. The US Department of Justice has agreed to review the city’s Division of Police.\n\nThe shooting of Lewis happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday at an apartment building where uniformed officers were serving a felony warrant for domestic violence and assault and improper handling of a firearm, Bryant said. A news release by police indicated the man who was shot, later identified as Lewis, as the person sought in the felony warrant.\n\n“The officers knocked on the door for several minutes … acknowledging themselves as Columbus Police officers,” Bryant said.\n\nPolice body camera video shows them knocking and calling out to occupants repeatedly for more than eight minutes. They call for “Donovan” by name several times.\n\nEventually, a man came to the door and was detained by police, Bryant said. He told officers he’d been asleep, and they took a knife from his pocket. A second man inside the apartment was detained about a minute later.\n\nA screengrab from bodycam footage shows Columbus Police Officer Ricky Anderson and K9 moments before shooting and killing 20-year-old Donovan Lewis. WSYX/Columbus Police\n\nOfficers asked if anyone else was inside the apartment, Bryant said, but were unable to determine that, and Anderson and a K9 were then called in by Columbus Police to see if anyone else was inside.\n\n“Once the K9 officer arrived on the scene, additional announcements were made for anyone else inside to come out or the K9 was going to be released inside of the apartment,” Bryant said.\n\nIn the body camera video, the K9 is seen barking outside a back bedroom door, then officers enter the apartment and warn they are going to send a dog in.\n\nAn officer is seen opening the bedroom door, where a man is seen on a bed.\n\nBodycam video shows Anderson firing a single shot at a man, later identified as Lewis, moments after opening the bedroom door.\n\nDuring the news conference, Bryant showed the body camera video frame-by-frame, asserting that the moment Anderson opened fire, it appeared Lewis was holding “something” in his hand.\n\nA vape pen was later found next to Lewis on the bed, Bryant says.\n\nOnce Lewis was handcuffed, video shows, officers began rendering aid. Lewis was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:19 a.m., according to the Columbus Police statement.\n\nLewis’ death follows a string of other police shootings\n\nAttorneys for the officer expressed sympathy for Lewis’ family in a statement Thursday but said police officers “are forced to make split-second decisions in response to the actions of others.”\n\n“When we analyze police involved shootings, we must look to the totality of the circumstances and we are expressly forbidden from using 20/20 hindsight, because unlike all of us, officers are not afforded the luxury of armchair reflection when they are faced with rapidly evolving, volatile encounters in dangerous situations,” the statement by attorneys Mark Collins and Kaitlin Stephens said. “Because of this, the law allows a reasonable officer to be mistaken, just as the law allows us as non-police officers to be mistaken.”\n\n“We are sure the investigation will be thorough,” they said, “and we certainly hope the process of any future legal proceedings will be more fair than what we have seen in the recent past.”\n\nBryant, the police chief, said Tuesday officers are “put in compromising, potentially life-threatening situations” every day, “in which we are required to make split-second decisions.”\n\n“As the chief, it is my job to hold my officers accountable, but it’s also my job to offer them support and make sure that I give that to them through the process,” Bryant said. “If they do the right things for the right reasons, we will support them. If they do something wrong, they will be held accountable.”\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, left, and Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant speak to reporters about the shooting of Donovan Lewis. WBNS\n\nBut Elliott, the family’s attorney, called Lewis’ death “utterly senseless,” saying “excessive deadly force was recklessly used by officer Anderson when he shot and killed an unarmed Black man.”\n\n“How many more lives are going to be lost to this type of reckless activity? How many more young Black lives will be lost? How many more families like Donovan’s will need to appear in news conferences like this one,” Elliott asked Thursday, “before our leaders do enough to put a stop to these barbaric killings?”\n\nPrior incidents in Columbus that have spurred scrutiny of law enforcement include:\n\n• A Franklin County Sheriff’s Office deputy fatally shot Casey Goodson Jr. in December 2020 as the 23-year-old tried to enter his home with a Subway sandwich. The deputy was working for the US Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force looking for violent offenders at the time, police said, but Goodson, who was legally armed at the time, was not the person being sought. A grand jury indicted the deputy on two counts of murder and one count of reckless homicide.\n\n• Later that month, a Columbus police officer fatally shot Andre Hill as he walked toward the officer while holding an illuminated cell phone in his left hand, body camera footage showed. The officer in that case was fired and charged with murder, and the city council later voted to approve a $10 million settlement to Hill’s family, the largest in the city’s history.\n\n• Ma’Khia Bryant, 16, was killed in another shooting last April when Columbus police responded to her foster home, where Ma’Khia had been arguing with another young woman over a messy home and unmade bed. Police body camera video showed Ma’Khia lunge at the other woman with a knife, and a grand jury later declined to indict the officer who fired the fatal shot.\n\nLewis’ family has appreciated the community’s support so far, Elliott said, and asked that any gatherings or protests remain “peaceful and supportive and constructive.”\n\n“Reality is, if we don’t gather, and we don’t indicate how upsetting this is to all of us, we’re never going to see change,” the attorney said.", "authors": ["Amanda Musa Dakin Andone Michelle Watson", "Amanda Musa", "Dakin Andone", "Michelle Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/03/find-out-who-tallahassee-democrat-named-2021-person-year/9032443002/", "title": "Find out who the Tallahassee Democrat named 2021 Person of the ...", "text": "Through alpha, delta and now omicron, there’s a place people know they can count on to get accurate, reliable and speedy COVID-19 test results.\n\nAt this point in the pandemic, it’s now just referred to as “the testing site,” as if there’s only one in Tallahassee.\n\nThe Florida A&M University COVID-19 testing site opened in April 2020 with the anticipation that it would operate for a couple of weeks. At first, the site only had the capacity to test 200 people a day.\n\nIts solid reputation quickly grew, and while other testing sites dealt with long lines and lagging test results, FAMU persevered.

But it also goes to Cynthia M. Harris, associate dean for public health at FAMU.\n\nThen there's Tracy Pleiss, the lead nurse.

That morning, the site opened at 7:20 a.m. because there was already a line.\n\nThe COVID symptoms that she said she's seeing are similar to the common cold: stuffy nose, runny nose or sore throat.

The site also now tests for Influenza A and B for people who are symptomatic.\n\nThe streamlined process is a result of months of trial and error. Different variants mean different configurations to keep people safe.

It has claimed more than 6,000 lives, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe United States was swept up in the outcry over Ebola when a Liberian national, Thomas Eric Duncan, became the first Ebola patient diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil.\n\nDuncan, who contracted the disease in Liberia before traveling to the U.S., died in a Dallas hospital in October. Two nurses who treated him were infected, but recovered.\n\nThe Time cover story takes an close-up look at people on the front lines of the fight against Ebola, from Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control, to ambulance supervisor Foday Gallah.\n\nFrieden says there was initially friction with the World Health Organization when the CDC sent in a team to West Africa.\n\n\"Essentially, people thought it was going to be controlled, and they didn't want us there. So I had to tell WHO, 'Let our team in, this is ridiculous,'\" Frieden says. \"They wanted to do it themselves. There was resentment. They didn't want to feel like they were dependent on the CDC. We left, and then Ebola came roaring back.\"\n\nGallah, an ambulance drive, explaining his work, says, \"I am going to get on that ambulance.

Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home. CNN\n\nThe walk from the shoreline of Sanibel Island to Emig and Paskaly’s home was less than a mile along a windy, sandy road. On the way, the couple saw a familiar bright blue street sign lying mangled in the mud in a pile of twisted gutters, blankets and branches. They also passed a large banyan tree that had many of its branches twisted and snapped, with one large branch lying in front of a neighbor’s garage.\n\nAs they neared their home, Paskaly said with a heavy sigh: “I’m afraid to turn the corner.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly saw this mangled sign on Sanibel Island as the couple returned to check on their home. CNN\n\nSanibel’s reopening to residents came the same day President Joe Biden visited Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, was also briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island.

Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky.\n\n“Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.”\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nJessica Hernstadt, a resident of Fort Myers Beach in Lee County, said the community “looked like an apocalyptic disaster” when she made her way there after Ian slammed the shore, with cars, pots, pans and clothing littering the area.\n\nHomes the storm tore from their foundations blocked the streets leading to her house, which she found ablaze when she arrived, she told CNN in an interview Wednesday.\n\nLater, combing through the ashes, Hernstadt found just one item unscathed: a candlestick holder her great-grandmother carried in her pockets as she emigrated from Poland to the US.\n\n“It was the simplest, most prized possession that I had, and it gave me a sense of hope, especially today being Yom Kippur,” she said Wednesday. Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year in Judaism.\n\n“We will survive. Our town will survive, and there’s hope to rebuild,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Randi Kaye Laura Dolan", "Amir Vera", "Randi Kaye", "Laura Dolan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/covid-booster-flu-shot-timing-explained-wellness/index.html", "title": "Getting your Covid booster and flu shot at the same time: everything ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFall and winter are around the corner, which means not only is it time to get your flu shot, but US health officials are urging everyone who is eligible to get their updated Covid-19 booster, too.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the updated Covid-19 vaccine boosters this month, after the US Food and Drug Administration’s authorization. The updated Pfizer/BioNTech booster is authorized for people 12 and older, and Moderna’s is authorized for 18 and older.\n\nAt the same time, health officials stress the recommendation to get your seasonal flu vaccine. Some disease forecasters worry that the upcoming flu season could be a tough one for North America, as nations in the Southern Hemisphere that already had their flu seasons – like Australia and New Zealand – saw higher-than-average peaks in cases. So, the United States could see flu make a comeback while Covid-19 is still circulating at higher levels.\n\nBarring any new and concerning coronavirus variants, some officials predict that the updated Covid-19 shots could be the start of recommended boosters for Americans each year, similar to how updated annual flu vaccines are given.\n\n“For a majority of Americans, one shot a year will provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness, and that’s what we’ve got to be focused on,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN last week. “Maybe for some high-risk people – the elderly, the immunocompromised – they may need protection more than once a year, but for a majority of Americans, that’s where it is, and I think that’s a really good place to be.”\n\nWhere and when to get Covid-19 booster and flu shot\n\nThe updated Covid-19 vaccine booster and seasonal flu vaccines are available at most pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health care clinics.\n\nNot only are US health officials encouraging people to get both shots this year, some local public health departments are planning to schedule joint vaccine clinics, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“Jurisdictions are going to be standing up joint flu and Covid vaccine clinics and other opportunities for people to get both their flu vaccine and their Covid updated booster together,” Freeman said, adding that there is “no problem at all” with getting both shots at or around the same time.\n\nThe hope is for joint clinics to make it more convenient and accessible for people to get their vaccinations – but not everyone might be interested or even eligible to get both vaccines at the same time. Plus, some say it’s still early to get a flu shot.\n\nA single dose of the updated Covid-19 booster is recommended at least two months after the initial vaccine series or your most recent booster.\n\n“Now, suppose you’ve recovered from Covid – and many people of course have had Covid this summer – wait three months, at least,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nHe added that it’s important to get your booster as soon as you are eligible.\n\n“It’s clear that whether you’re vaccinated or you’ve had Covid, if you get this booster, you will get much higher levels of antibody and they are thought to help us get more prolonged protection,” he said. “The other thing that happens is that the immune system responds more broadly, and it looks as though we will get more broad coverage against other variants.”\n\nAs for the flu shot, the recommended timing of vaccination for this flu season is similar to last season, according to the CDC’s website.\n\n“For most people who need only one dose for the season, September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated,” according to the CDC, adding that while “ideally” it’s recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October, vaccination after October can still provide protection during the peak of flu season.\n\n“The ideal time is during the month of October and maybe the first couple of weeks of November – and the reason I say that is, particularly for older people and people who are frail, that will help their protection extend well through February into March, and that’s when flu often peaks in the United States in February,” Schaffner said. “Everyone ages 6 months and older should get influenza vaccine.”\n\nAs for children younger than 12, who are not eligible for the updated Covid-19 booster, Schaffner said parents should focus on getting their youngsters vaccinated with the primary series or booster they can get now.\n\n“I would say, maintain the current schedule,” he said. “Because it’s quite clear the original still does a good job in protecting us against hospitalizations and more severe disease.”\n\nSchaffner added that some people have asked him whether the Covid-19 vaccine protects against flu or vice versa. They do not.\n\n“You do have to get both vaccines,” he said. “The Covid vaccine will not protect against flu. The flu vaccine will not protect against Covid.”\n\nBracing for possible Covid-19 surge\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced its plan to manage Covid-19 this fall as there is the potential for an increase in infections, in part due to waning immunity from vaccines and infection.\n\n“Additionally, as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, contagious viruses like COVID-19 can spread more easily,” the announcement says. “And, as we saw last fall with the emergence of Omicron, we must continue to stay prepared for the possibility of a potential new variant of concern.”\n\nThe White House continues to call on Congress to pass additional funding for Covid-19 response, having asked for an updated $22.4 billion last week. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said that passing that funding would be “a very hard lift.”\n\nThe administration’s plan to manage Covid-19 this fall includes focusing on encouraging updated booster vaccinations and making them easy to access, as well as ensuring that people have easy access to at-home rapid tests and treatments. That includes the purchase of 100 million additional at-home rapid tests from domestic manufacturers, the White House said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services “will launch a paid media campaign aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on those over age 50, as well as Black, Hispanic, rural, Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native audiences through TV, radio, digital and print outlets.”\n\nThe administration is also boosting “easy access to Covid-19 testing and treatments” but warned, “While the lack of additional COVID-19 funding from Congress puts constraints on what we are able to do, the Administration will do everything in its power to ensure that tests and treatments remain widely available and easy to access, and will encourage Americans to use them.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

Heck, I even wrote a book about all the things that are more important than the resume. Yes, you do need a one, but what most experts don’t tell you is that resumes only account for 10% of the hiring decision.\n\nThat said, it would take a lot to wow a tough critic like myself. A few years ago, however, I was surprised to find a resume that actually managed to impress me.\n\nIn fact, it was one of the best resumes I had ever seen in my 20 years of hiring and interviewing. It had no gimmicks, no Fortune 500 company listed and wasn’t folded into an origami airplane. Needless to say, I hired the candidate.\n\nHere’s what made it stand out from the rest:\n\n1. It was easy to read\n\nThis resume had plenty of white space and was two pages long, which is expected if you have more than 10 years of experience.\n\nEverything was nicely organized: Line spacing was just right, company names in bold, titles italicized and job details arranged in bullet points. Oh, and not a single typo to be found.\n\nSocial Security tips:You need to know how much income you can expect\n\nI liked that the font was nothing fancy. Too many candidates waste time obsessing over which font to use. I won’t weigh in on Times New Roman versus Calibri, but I will say that it should always be simple and easy to read.\n\n2. It told a story\n\nThis resume told a story about the candidate’s career journey. There were no information gaps (i.e., a missing summer). From top to bottom, there was a clear “before and after.” In just a few seconds, I was able to see a “staircase pattern” of the candidate’s career growth.\n\nIn other words, the chronological list of work history – in order of date, with the most recent position at the top – showed a clear progression of more senior roles and more advanced responsibilities.\n\n3. It listed accomplishments, rather than just responsibilities\n\nI’m not interested in reading what you copied and pasted from the original job description listing. What employers really want to know is whether you’re an above-average candidate who’s capable of delivering quantifiable results – and this person did a great job of proving that they were.\n\nIt’s always better to highlight your responsibilities by detailing your most impressive accomplishments:\n\nExamples:\n\nInstead of “expanded operations to international markets,” say, “expanded operations to eight new countries in Latin America. ”\n\nInstead of “led marketing and sales team,” say, “supervised marketing and sales team and achieved 15% annual growth vs. 0.5% budget. ”\n\n4. It told the truth\n\nThere weren’t any discrepancies that raised red flags. Everything was believable and the numbers weren’t exaggerated.\n\nEven better, the resume had links to the person’s LinkedIn page and professional website, which included a portfolio of their work. This made it easier for me to fact-check the resume, which in turn made the candidate seem like an honest person.\n\nWomen, minorities receive less benefits:Politicians are looking to change that\n\nMy advice? Tell the truth – period. A colleague once told me about someone who listed “convicted felon” on her resume. The candidate submitted her resume, then called the hiring manager and asked, “Would you hire an ex-convict?” After a series of questions and some due diligence, they offered her the job. And based on what I’ve heard, she ended up being an excellent hire.\n\nWhile big accomplishments and recognizable company names will give you an advantage, make no mistake: Employers will do a reference check – and if they find out that you lied about something, it’s game over.\n\n5. It didn’t have any cliché claims\n\nThere were no generic and high-level claims such as “creative,” “hard-working,” “results-driven,” “excellent communicator” or, my least favorite, “team player.”\n\nIncluding any of these cliché terms will make your hiring manager roll their eyes in less than a second. Skip the cheesy adjectives and overused terms and go for action verbs instead.\n\nExamples:\n\nInstead of “excellent communicator,” say, “presented at face-to-face client meetings and spoke at college recruiting events. ”\n\nInstead of “highly creative,” say, “designed and implemented new global application monitoring platform.”\n\n6. It came through a recommendation\n\nNot everyone will have a connection at their dream company, but knowing someone who can refer you is the most effective way to get an employer’s attention.\n\nThe fact that this resume came through a recommendation from a respected colleague played a significant role in getting me to open the PDF file. That, in addition to the few seconds I spent skimming it, was the one-two punch that made me want to know more about the candidate.\n\nMillennials are about to turn 40:Time for a financial checkup\n\nBlasting your resume everywhere won’t get you anywhere. I get sent dozens of resumes on the daily from people I don’t know, and the vast majority of them go unopened.\n\nThat might seem harsh, but here’s the truth: You should always go out of your way to get a warm introduction. If you don’t have a connection, do some research and find a friend of a friend who knows someone who has an “in.”\n\nThen, ask your potential referral out for a coffee date. Once you’ve established a genuine relationship, tell them about the job opening you’re interested in and ask if they can recommend you. If you can make this happen, I guarantee your resume will get read.\n\nGary Burnison is the CEO of Korn Ferry, a global consulting firm that helps companies select and hire the best talent.

Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nBiden, his top officials and fellow Western leaders have spent the past several months debating what steps Putin may take as his troops suffer embarrassing losses on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWhether Putin is acting rationally has been a subject of intense debate as leaders work to predict his next steps. While Biden said Tuesday he believed Putin himself was rational, he characterized the Russian leader’s aims in Ukraine – which Putin laid out in an angry speech as he launched the war in February – as ridiculous.\n\n“You listen to what he says. If you listen to the speech he made after when that decision was being made, he talked about the whole idea of – he was needed to be the leader of Russia that united all of Russian speakers. I mean, it’s just I just think it’s irrational,” Biden said.\n\nGoing further, Biden said Putin wrongly believed Ukrainians would submit to Russian invasion – a misjudgment that’s been disproved by fierce resistance inside the country.\n\n“I think the speech, his objectives were not rational. I think he thought, Jake, I think he thought he was going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was the home of Mother Russia in Kyiv, and that where he was going to be welcomed, and I think he just totally miscalculated,” Biden said.\n\nIndeed, a counteroffensive launched by Ukraine last month was successful in retaking territory previously held by the Russians, including critical transportation hubs. The losses proved the latest major embarrassment for Russia, whose military has struggled over the course of the seven-month war.\n\nThis week, however, Russia launched one of its fiercest bombing campaigns since invading in late February. At least 19 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded across the country, as far away as the western city of Lviv, hundreds of miles from the war’s main theaters in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nAsked whether he would meet Putin at next month’s Group of 20 summit in Indonesia, Biden said he didn’t see a good reason for a sit-down.\n\n“It would depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about,” Biden said, adding if Putin wanted to discuss the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner then he would be open to talking.\n\n“But look, he’s acted brutally, he’s acted brutally,” Biden said. “I think he’s committed war crimes. And so I don’t, I don’t see any rationale to meet with him now.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nNuclear ‘mistakes’ or ‘miscalculation’\n\nAfter Biden warned last week the risk of nuclear “Armageddon” was at its highest point since the Cuban Missile Crisis, he told Tapper he didn’t believe Putin would ultimately take that step.\n\n“I don’t think he will,” Biden said when asked by Tapper whether the Russian leader would use a tactical nuclear weapon – a prospect US officials have watched with concern as Russian troops suffer embarrassing losses on the battlefield.\n\n“I think it’s irresponsible for him to talk about it, the idea that a world leader of one of the largest nuclear powers in the world says he may use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine,” Biden added.\n\nBiden said even Putin’s threats have a destabilizing effect, and warned of the potential errors in judgment that could ensue.\n\n“The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome,” he told Tapper. “And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war or anything, but just once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the miscalculations, who knows what would happen.”\n\n“He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do,” Biden added later. “The mistakes get made. And the miscalculation could occur, no one can be sure what would happen and could end in Armageddon.”\n\nBiden refused to disclose what a US response would look like should Putin follow through on his nuclear threats. But he said the Department of Defense had proactively developed contingencies should the scenario come to pass.\n\n“What is the red line for the United States and NATO, and have you directed the Pentagon and other agencies to game out what a response would be if he did use a tactical nuclear weapon or if he bombed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine or anything along those lines?” Tapper asked.\n\n“There’s been discussions of that, but I’m not going to get into that. It would be irresponsible of me to talk about what we would or wouldn’t do,” Biden said.\n\n“Have you asked the Pentagon to game it out, though?” Tapper asked.\n\n“The Pentagon didn’t have to be asked,” Biden said.\n\nBiden spoke to Tapper a few hours after meeting virtually with members of the Group of 7 industrialized nations, who heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the need to bolster his country’s air defenses amid the new Russian bombardments.\n\nZelensky told the meeting that “common efforts to create an air shield for Ukraine” must be intensified amid a barrage of Russian cruise missile and drone attacks.\n\nWhite House officials have said the US is prepared to further bolster Ukraine’s air defenses, including through missile defense systems that Biden expedited delivery of over the summer.\n\nYet Russia’s intense aerial assault of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and on civilian infrastructure suggested Putin could be employing new tactics meant to terrorize Ukrainians as the winter approaches.\n\nBiden speaks Tapper during the interview. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\n‘Consequences’ for Saudi Arabia\n\nBiden told Tapper he believed it was time to “rethink” the US relationship with Saudi Arabia after the kingdom partnered with Russia to cut oil production, a rebuke after intensive White House efforts to prevent such a decision.\n\n“I am in the process, when the House and Senate gets back, they’re going to have to – there’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done with Russia,” Biden said.\n\nThe decision by the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel to cut production last week prompted anger at the White House, where officials said Biden was personally disappointed by what they called a “shortsighted” decision.\n\nThe move, which came three months after Biden visited Saudi Arabia and met its de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has the potential to raise gas prices in the weeks ahead of November’s midterm elections.\n\n“Let’s get straight why I went,” Biden said. “I didn’t go about oil, I went about making sure that we made sure that we weren’t going to walk away from the Middle East.”\n\nAfter reaching highs over the summer, gas prices had been steadily decreasing, providing Biden and his top aides a potent talking point in the lead-up to the elections.\n\nBut a combination of factors, including rising demand and maintenance at some US refineries, has caused prices to begin ticking back up. The OPEC+ decision is poised to aggravate those factors.\n\nFor Biden, the decision was a particular affront because of his efforts over the summer to repair ties with Saudi Arabia, despite the kingdom’s woeful human rights record and bin Salman’s role in the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThis story has been updated with more from the interview with Biden.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/entertainment/dave-chappelle-transgender-controversy-timeline-cec/index.html", "title": "Dave Chappelle on 'SNL': A timeline of the controversy around his ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTonight Dave Chappelle will host “Saturday Night Live” for the third time – an appearance that is courting controversy before he even takes the stage.\n\nThe comedian has drawn increasing ire in recent years for making jokes aimed at transgender people, and the outcry grew louder last fall when Netflix released a Chappelle special, “The Closer,” in which he doubled down on his comments.\n\nNetflix stood by Chappelle, who went on a national tour after the special and largely ignored the controversy after addressing it in his act.\n\nBut his comments were criticized by fellow comics, fans, trans advocates and some Netflix employees, and a Minnesota venue canceled a Chappelle show this year over the controversy.\n\nGiven that context, it was surprising to some “SNL” viewers to see him invited back to Studio 8H. Here’s a look at Chappelle’s recent history of jokes about trans people – and the resulting backlash.\n\n2017\n\nAugust: In a series of stand-up shows at New York City’s Radio City Music Hall, Chappelle made jokes aimed at trans people for at least 20 minutes, Vulture reported.

But he delivered them in New York after drawing some backlash for earlier comments.\n\n“That joke and others in this section suffer from the same problems as those from his specials – they are rooted in disgust and generalization,” Vulture wrote of a Chappelle joke about ISIS fighters being horrified by transgender soldiers. “They’re just not good.”\n\n2019\n\nAugust 26: Netflix released a stand-up special, “Sticks and Stones,” in which Chappelle performed more material about trans people, including some content from his Radio City shows. In an epilogue to the special, he brought up his friend Daphne Dorman, a trans comedian, whom he said laughed hardest at his jokes about trans people.\n\n2021\n\nOctober 5: Netflix released Chappelle’s special “The Closer.” In it, he goes on an extended tangent about transgender people and makes several jokes at their expense. He misgenders a trans comedian, once again makes explicit jokes about trans women’s bodies and defends TERFs, or trans-exclusionary radical feminists.\n\nHe also referred to trans people as “transgenders,” states that “gender is a fact” and later says that Dorman died by suicide shortly after she was criticized by other trans people for defending Chappelle after “Sticks and Stones.”\n\nAt the time Chappelle’s special was released, at least 33 states had introduced anti-transgender legislation, much of it aimed at young trans people.\n\nOctober 13: Amid calls from LGBTQ advocates, fellow comedians, Netflix employees and social justice organizations to pull the special, Netflix stood by Chappelle.\n\nIn a letter obtained by the Verge and Variety, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told employees that the special will remain available to stream.\n\n“We don’t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe ‘The Closer’ crosses that line … Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it’s an important part of our content offering,” Sarandos wrote.\n\nNetflix suspended three employees for attending a virtual meeting of directors to discuss the special without notifying the meeting organizer in advance. Among them was Terra Field, a trans senior software engineer who had publicly criticized the special and Netflix. Her suspension was later reversed.\n\nDave Chappelle attends the UK premiere of \"Dave Chappelle: Untitled\" at Cineworld Leicester Square on October 17, 2021, in London. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images\n\nOctober 19: Sarandos told Variety he “screwed up” his communications with Netflix employees but reaffirmed he did not believe the special qualifies as “hate speech.”\n\nOctober 20: Around 65 demonstrators, including Netflix employees and trans advocates, participated in a walkout in protest of Netflix’s support of “The Closer.” The demonstrators called on Netflix to hire more trans and non-binary executives and fund more trans and non-binary talent.\n\nOctober 24: Three trans stand-up comics told CNN they were disappointed by Chappelle’s jokes, even though all three said they once considered the celebrated performer as a comedy inspiration. While all of them agreed that jokes about trans people aren’t inherently offensive, they said Chappelle’s set was infused with the same hateful rhetoric and language used by anti-transgender critics.\n\n“When he talks about the trans community, he’s not talking about them, he’s speaking out against them,” comedian Nat Puff told CNN. “And that’s the difference between saying something funny about the trans community and saying something offensive about the trans community.”\n\nA fourth comic, Flame Monroe, one of the only trans comics whose material is streaming on Netflix, told CNN she believes Chappelle should be allowed to joke about trans people, even though she initially was taken aback by some of his comments.\n\nOctober 25: Chappelle addressed critics at a show in Nashville, appearing alongside Joe Rogan, the podcast host who’s been criticized for dismissing the effectiveness of vaccines and using racial slurs, among other controversies.\n\nChappelle released videos on his official Instagram account from the set, in which he seemingly addressed the trans employees at Netflix who participated in the walkout over “The Closer.”\n\n“It seems like I’m the only one who can’t go to the office anymore,” he said.\n\n“I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it as though it’s me versus that community, that’s not what it is,” Chappelle went on. “Do not blame the LBGTQ (sic) community for any of this s—. This has nothing to do with them. It’s about corporate interest and what I can say and what I cannot say.”\n\n“For the record – and I need you to know this – everyone I know from that community has been nothing but loving and supportive. So I don’t know what all this nonsense is about.”\n\n2022\n\nJuly 12: “The Closer” was nominated for two Emmys, including “outstanding variety special (pre-recorded).” Adele later won the category.\n\nJuly 21: A Minneapolis venue canceled Chappelle’s sold-out show hours before its doors were set to open, apologizing to “staff, artists and our community” after receiving criticism for hosting Chappelle.\n\n“We believe in diverse voices and the freedom of artistic expression, but in honoring that, we lost sight of the impact this would have,” wrote First Avenue, the venue famous for being featured in Prince’s “Purple Rain” film.\n\nNovember 5: “Saturday Night Live” announced Chappelle would be its post-midterms host. The backlash was swift.\n\nField joked on Twitter: “Wait I thought I cancelled (sic) him. Is it possible cancel culture isn’t a real thing??”\n\nNovember 10: After the New York Post reported that several “SNL” writers are boycotting Saturday’s episode, Chappelle’s representatives told CNN there are no issues with writers or cast members. “SNL’s” current staff includes nonbinary cast member Molly Kearney and nonbinary writer Celeste Yim.\n\nChappelle will take the stage live Saturday at 11:30 p.m. ET.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

She was 90.\n\nLynn’s family said in a statement to CNN that she died Tuesday at her home in Tennessee.\n\n“Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,” the statement read.\n\nThey asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial will be announced later.\n\nLynn, who had no formal music training but spent hours every day singing her babies to sleep, was known to churn out fully textured songs in a matter of minutes. She just wrote what she knew.\n\nShe lived in poverty for much of her early life, began having kids by age 17 and spent years married to a man prone to drinking and philandering – all of which became material for her plainspoken songs. Lynn’s life was rich with experiences most country stars of the time hadn’t had for themselves – but her female fans knew them intimately.\n\n“So when I sing those country songs about women struggling to keep things going, you could say I’ve been there,” she wrote in her first memoir, “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” “Like I say, I know what it’s like to be pregnant and nervous and poor.”\n\nLynn scored hits with fiery songs like “Don’t Come Home A’ Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ On Your Mind)” and “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),” which topped the country charts in 1966 and made her the first female country singer to write a No. 1 hit.\n\nHer songs recounted family history, skewered lousy husbands and commiserated with women, wives and mothers everywhere. Her tell-it-like-it-is style saw tracks such as “Rated X” and “The Pill” banned from radio, even as they became beloved classics.\n\n“I wasn’t the first woman in country music,” Lynn told Esquire in 2007. “I was just the first one to stand up there and say what I thought, what life was about.”\n\nShe grew up dirt-poor in the Kentucky hills\n\nShe was born Loretta Webb in 1932, one of eight Webb children raised in Butcher Hollow in the Appalachian mining town of Van Lear, Kentucky. Growing up, Lynn sang in church and at home, even as her father protested that everyone in Butcher Hollow could hear.\n\nLoretta Lynn wears a cowboy hat and a fringe western style jacket while holding an acoustic guitar as she poses for a portrait in circa 1960 in Nashville, Tennessee. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nHer family had little money. But those early years were some of her fondest memories, as she recounts in her 1971 hit, “Coal Miner’s Daughter”: “We were poor but we had love; That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of.”\n\nAs a young teenager, Loretta met the love of her life in Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn, whom she affectionately called “Doo.” The pair married when Lynn was 15 – a fact cleared up in 2012, after the Associated Press discovered Lynn was a few years older than she had said she was in her memoir – and Lynn gave birth to their first of six children the same year.\n\n“When I got married, I didn’t even know what pregnant meant,” said Lynn, who bore four children in the first four years of marriage and a set of twins years later.\n\n“I was five months pregnant when I went to the doctor, and he said, ‘You’re gonna have a baby.’ I said, ‘No way. I can’t have no baby.’ He said, ‘Ain’t you married?’ Yep. He said, ‘You sleep with your husband?’ Yep. ‘You’re gonna have a baby, Loretta. Believe me.’ And I did.”\n\nThe couple soon headed to Washington state in search of jobs. Music wasn’t a priority for the young mother at first. She’d spend her days working, mostly, picking strawberries in Washington state while her babies sat on a blanket nearby.\n\nBut when her husband heard her humming tunes and soothing their babies to sleep, he said she sounded better than the girl singers on the radio. He bought her a $17 Harmony guitar and got her a gig at a local tavern.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1960 that she’d record what would become her debut single, “Honky Tonk Girl.” She then took the song on the road, playing country music stations across the United States.\n\nAfter years of hard work and raising kids, telling stories with her guitar seemed like a break.\n\nLoretta Lynn performs in 2016 during South By Southwest in Austin, Texas.

Al Wagner/Invision/AP Loretta Lynn's life in pictures Prev Next\n\n“Singing was easy,” Lynn told NPR’s Terry Gross in 2010. “I thought ‘Gee whiz, this is an easy job.’ ”\n\nThe success of her first single landed Lynn on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and, soon, a contract with Decca Records. She quickly befriended country star Patsy Cline, who guided her through the fame and fashion of country stardom until her shocking death in a plane crash in 1963.\n\nCline “was my only girlfriend at the time. She took me under her wing, and when I lost her, it was something else. I still miss her to this day,” Lynn told The Denver Post in 2009. “I wrote ‘You Ain’t Woman Enough to Take My Man,’ and she said, ‘Loretta, that’s a damn hit.’ It shocked me, because you don’t expect somebody like Patsy Cline to tell you that you have a hit. Right after she passed, I put the record out, and it was a hit.”\n\nHer best-known songs drew from her life and marriage\n\nLynn’s struggle and success became the stuff of legend, an oft-repeated story of youth, naivete and poverty.\n\nFrom “Fist City” to “You’re Lookin’ at Country,” Lynn always sang from the heart, whether she was telling off a woman interested in Doo or honoring her Appalachian roots. But her music was far from conventional.\n\nShe rankled the conservative country establishment with songs like “Rated X,” about the stigma fun-loving women face after divorce, and “The Pill,” in which a woman toasts her newfound freedom thanks to birth control – “They didn’t have none of them pills when I was younger, or I’d have been swallowing them like popcorn,” Lynn wrote in her memoir.\n\nShe documented her upbringing in the bestselling 1976 memoir “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” co-written with George Vecsey. A 1980 biographical film by the same name won an Academy Award for actress Sissy Spacek and brought Lynn wider fame. Lynn’s success also helped launch the music careers of her sisters, Peggy Sue Wright and Crystal Gayle.\n\nLynn’s legend faced questions in 2012 when The Associated Press reported that in census records, a birth certificate and marriage license, Lynn was three years older than what most biographies stated. It didn’t mar Lynn’s success, but did make the oft-repeated tales of her teen marriage and motherhood less extreme.\n\n“I never, never thought about being a role model,” Lynn told the San Antonio Express-News in 2010. “I wrote from life, how things were in my life. I never could understand why others didn’t write down what they knew.”\n\nLynn always credited her husband with giving her the confidence to first step on stage as a young performer. She also spoke in interviews, and in her music, about the pain he caused over their nearly 50 years of marriage. Doolittle Lynn died in 1996 after years of complications from heart problems and diabetes.\n\nIn her 2002 memoir, “Still Woman Enough,” Lynn wrote that he was an alcoholic who cheated on her and beat her, even as she hit him back. But she stayed with him until his death and told NPR in 2010 that “he’s in there somewhere” in every song she wrote.\n\n“We fought one day and we’d love the next, so I mean … to me, that’s a good relationship,” she told NPR. “If you can’t fight, if you can’t tell each other what you think – why, your relationship ain’t much anyway.”\n\nLynn won numerous awards throughout her career, including three Grammys and many honors from the Academy of Country Music. She earned Grammys for her 1971 duet with Conway Twitty, “After the Fire is Gone,” and for the 2004 album “Van Lear Rose,” a collaboration with Jack White of the White Stripes that introduced her to a new generation of fans.\n\nThen President Barack Obama awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Loretta Lynn in 2013. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nShe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and her song “Coal Miner’s Daughter” was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, and in 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Lynn “gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about.”\n\nHer career and legend only continued to grow in her later years as she recorded new songs, toured steadily and drew loyal audiences well into her 80s. A museum and dude ranch are dedicated to Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.\n\n“Working keeps you young,” she told Esquire in 2007. “I ain’t ever gonna stop. And when I do, it’s gonna be right on stage. That’ll be it.”\n\nLynn was hospitalized in 2017 after suffering a stroke at her home. The following year she broke a hip. Her health forced her to quit touring.\n\nIn early 2021, at the age of 89, she recorded her 50th album, “Still Woman Enough.”\n\nThe title song, which she sang alongside successors Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire, sounded like a mission statement that captures the ethos of her career:\n\n“I’m still woman enough, still got what it takes inside;\n\nI know how to love, lose, and survive;\n\nAin’t much I ain’t seen, I ain’t tried;\n\nI’ve been knocked down, but never out of the fight;\n\nI’m strong, but I’m tender;\n\nWise, but I’m tough;\n\nAnd let me tell you when it comes to love;\n\nI’m still woman enough.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht Scottie Andrew", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/politics/senate-midterm-election-mitch-mcconnell-facebook/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Mitch McConnell is right. Senate Republicans have a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWe’ve become used to displays of braggadocio by politicians (see former President Donald Trump). That’s why it’s notable when a politician admits that the political winds might not be going their way.\n\nSuch was the case when Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said this week that Republicans had a better chance of taking back the House than the Senate. “Candidate quality has a lot to do with [it],” he noted.\n\nMcConnell’s comments are where we begin our roundup of the news of the week that was.\n\nDisliked candidates could cost Republicans the Senate\n\nDemocrats’ chances of holding the Senate didn’t look so great when 2022 began. They weren’t in as bad of shape as they were in the House (as is still the case), but they were clear underdogs.\n\nToday, an average of different forecasts and political betting odds indicate that Democrats are slightly favored to hold on to Congress’ upper chamber. The change in Senate fortune comes as the party continues to poll far better than expected in a number of states while several Republican candidates struggle to connect with the voters.\n\nIn other words, McConnell seems to be exactly right.\n\nRecent polls from Arizona and Wisconsin are a case in point. President Joe Biden won both states in 2020 by less than a point, four years after voters there backed Trump. Republicans should be in a strong position in these states, if 2022 featured the normal midterm backlash against the president’s party.\n\nInstead, the Democratic candidates (Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin) have led in all the polls. In Arizona, Kelly was up 8 points over Republican Blake Masters in a Fox poll. In Wisconsin, Barnes was ahead by 7 points in a Marquette University Law School poll and by 4 points in a Fox poll over Republican Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nThe results were especially noteworthy because in all those polls, Biden was underwater in his net favorability rating (favorable minus unfavorable).\n\nThe reason Democrats were ahead in both states was in large part because the Republican candidates were also underwater. Masters’ net favorability rating was -4 points, while Johnson’s were -6 and -9 points in the Fox and Marquette polls respectively.\n\nThe Democratic candidates in both states, on the other hand, had positive net favorability ratings.\n\nThese aren’t the only purple states where we see the phenomenon of Democratic candidates being relatively popular, while Biden and Republican Senate candidates are unpopular. The same is true in Georgia and Pennsylvania, which Biden won by about a point or less in 2020 and that Trump took in 2016.\n\nDemocrats (Sen. Raphael Warnock and Lt. Gov John Fetterman) led the Republican candidates (Herschel Walker and Mehmet Oz) by 4 points and 11 points in late July Fox polls from Georgia and Pennsylvania respectively.\n\nThe cause, again, was unpopular Republican candidates. Walker’s net favorability rating was -5 points, while Oz’s was -20 points. The Democratic nominees in both states had positive net favorability ratings, which made up for the fact that Biden was underwater in his net favorability rating in both states.\n\nKeep in mind that these four states (Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) make up the majority of the truly competitive races on this year’s Senate map. Were Democrats to win all four, Republicans would need an upset in a state they aren’t currently expected to win to take back the Senate.\n\nIf anything, it seems like Republicans are the ones who are fighting off challengers in unexpected territory. A super PAC with ties to McConnell just had to reserve $28 million in advertising in Ohio, a state Trump won by 8 points in 2020. The polls there have been surprisingly close.\n\nNow, it is possible that Democrats’ current polling advantage ends up fading. Biden may ultimately be a drag on Senate Democratic candidates, and their advantage may be gone by Election Day. The national environment has historically worsened for the White House party as November approaches.\n\nMoreover, Republicans have outperformed Senate polling in recent years. In 2014, 2016 and 2020, Republican Senate candidates outperformed their final polls by an average of 3 to 5 points. (Neither side, on average, did better than their final polls in 2018.) Put another way, it’s plausible that even if Democrats continue to lead in the polls through Election Day, Republicans could still take back the Senate.\n\nBut if the Republican candidates continue to be unpopular, it shouldn’t be surprising to see their Democratic opponents maintain their leads, even with Biden’s unpopularity. Republicans blew their chance at taking control of the Senate during Barack Obama’s first midterm because of poor candidate quality, even though the President was unpopular.\n\nAnd a look at 2020 data from the American National Election Studies reveals that the few voters who disliked the President (Trump) and the Senate candidate of the opposition party (the Democrat) but liked the Senate candidate of the President’s party (the Republican) almost always voted for the candidate they liked.\n\nDemocrats would more than welcome that pattern in 2022.\n\nFacebook faces a youth revolt\n\nOne group of Americans who won’t be voting in this year’s midterms are teenagers under the age of 18. They represent, however, the pool of potential future voters and reaching them will be important to both political parties.\n\nIf Democrats and Republicans want to impart their message to today’s youth, Facebook doesn’t look like the way to go. This is the finding of a new Pew Research Center study that I briefly spoke about in my last column.\n\nIn a rather stunning development for this millennial, Facebook’s popularity with teenagers has plummeted. According to the Pew poll, just 32% of 13-17-year-olds use Facebook. That’s down from 71% in a 2014-2015 poll.\n\nA big problem for Facebook is that it seems to not be addictive enough. Only 10% of teens say they check Facebook multiple times a day.\n\nCompare that to the most popular social media sites: Snapchat, Instagram (owned by Facebook), Tiktok and YouTube. Multiple site or app visits per day ranged from 37% for Instagram to 60% for YouTube.\n\nAll of these sites and apps are known for letting you quickly scan many pictures and videos. While Facebook has many of those characteristics, it can have a lot of writing on it too.\n\nNot surprisingly, the most addictive sites are the most popular social media sites and apps as well. Almost all teens in the country (95%) say they use YouTube at least a little bit. TikTok comes in second at 67%. Snapchat and Instagram come in third and fourth. Since 2014-2015, both Snapchat (41% to 59%) and Instagram (52% to 62%) have seen growth among teenagers.\n\nThe good news for Facebook is that it is still used by about 70% of American adults. But certain trends are troubling. Google search traffic for Facebook in the US is half as high as it was four years and about a fifth as high as it was about a decade ago.\n\nThe bottom line is that the once cool kid on the block may have turned old and uncool like a lot of us.\n\nFor your brief encounters: National Senior Citizens Day!\n\nSpeaking of older Americans, Sunday marks a day to celebrate the young at heart among us. And for those younger than 65, realize that you too will hopefully grow to be that old.\n\nIndeed, senior citizens make up a larger share of the US population than they used to. They were 17% of the population last year, compared with less than 10% back in 1960.\n\nAnd we’re just going to get older as a society. Seniors are projected to make up 23% of the population by 2060, according to the US Census Bureau. They’re expected to outnumber children by 2034.\n\nLeftover data\n\nCovid-19 vaccines and the youngest: A new Gallup report reveals that a majority of US parents say they do not plan on having their children under age 5 vaccinated against Covid-19. Just 14% have already done so, while 29% say they plan to. Polling shows that about 80% of all US adults are vaccinated.\n\nThe lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic: A new Pew poll shows that 26% of Americans say that keeping healthy has become more important since the pandemic began. Americans are far more split on whether socializing outside the home has become more important (21%) or less important (35%).\n\nIt’s always Alabama in college football: In comforting news to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Alabama ranks No. 1 in both the AP’s top 25 and AFCA Coaches Poll.

The growth of zero-fee trading apps, including Robinhood, E-Trade and others, have made stock splits much more important in recent years.\n\nAmazon’s move may also be aimed to get it included in the famed Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tends to include less expensive stocks. Apple (AAPL), for example, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014 and got included in the Dow in 2015. Amazon’s split is no guarantee that it will be included in the Dow, but the index may want the world’s most valuable retailer, which is also a major cloud provider and media giant.\n\n“This split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,” Amazon said in a statement.\n\nIn case potential shareholders weren’t convinced, the company threw in another incentive to buy: a repurchasing program for $10 billion of its stock.

He was 94.\n\nClint Watson, press secretary for the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, confirmed to CNN that Poitier died Thursday evening.\n\nPoitier overcame an impoverished background in the Bahamas and softened his thick island accent to rise to the top of his profession at a time when prominent roles for Black actors were rare. He won the Oscar for 1963’s “Lilies of the Field,” in which he played an itinerant laborer who helps a group of White nuns build a chapel.\n\nMany of his best-known films explored racial tensions as Americans were grappling with social changes wrought by the civil rights movement. In 1967 alone, he appeared as a Philadelphia detective fighting bigotry in small-town Mississippi in “In the Heat of the Night” and a doctor who wins over his White fiancée’s skeptical parents in “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner.”\n\nPoitier’s movies struggled for distribution in the South, and his choice of roles was limited to what White-run studios would produce. Racial taboos, for example, precluded him from most romantic parts. But his dignified roles helped audiences of the 1950s and 1960s envision Black people not just as servants but as doctors, teachers and detectives.\n\nAt the same time, as the lone Black leading man in 1960s Hollywood, he came under tremendous scrutiny. He was too often hailed as a noble symbol of his race and endured criticism from some Black people who said he had betrayed them by taking sanitized roles and pandering to Whites.\n\n“It’s been an enormous responsibility,” Poitier told Oprah Winfrey in 2000. “And I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.”\n\nAs a young actor he overcame enormous challenges\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Sidney Poitier was born several months premature in Miami on February 20, 1927, so tiny he could fit in his father’s hand. His parents were tomato farmers who often traveled to and from Florida and the Bahamas.\n\nHe was not expected to live. His mother consulted a palm reader, who assuaged her fears.\n\n“The lady took her hand and started speaking to my mother: ‘Don’t worry about your son. He will survive,’ ” Poitier told CBS News in 2013. “And these were her words; she said, ‘He will walk with kings.’ ”\n\nSidney Poitier as a teacher who must win over his students in a still from the 1967 film \"To Sir, with Love.\" Columbia TriStar/Moviepix/Getty Images\n\nWhen he was 15, Poitier’s parents sent him from the Bahamas to live with an older brother in Miami, where they figured he would have better opportunities. His father took him to the dock and put $3 in his hand.\n\n“He said, ‘take care of yourself, son.’ And he turned me around to face the boat,” Poitier told NPR in 2009.\n\nPoitier didn’t like Miami and soon headed north to New York, where he tried his hand at acting. It did not go well at first. With limited schooling, he had trouble reading a script.\n\nBut he got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where a fortuitous encounter changed his life. An elderly waiter took an interest in the teen and spent nights after work reading the newspaper with him to improve his comprehension, grammar and punctuation.\n\n“That man, every night, the place is closed, everyone’s gone, and he sat there with me week after week after week,” Poitier told CBS News. “And he told me about punctuations. He told me where dots were and what the dots mean here between these two words, all of that stuff.”\n\nSoon after, Poitier landed work with the American Negro Theatre, where he took acting lessons, softened his Bahamian accent and landed a stage role as an understudy to Harry Belafonte. This led to roles on Broadway and eventually caught the attention of Hollywood.\n\nActor Sidney Poitier, left, with actor Tony Franciosa, talk show host David Susskind, singer Harry Belafonte and actress Shelley Winters on the talk show \"Open End\" in 1960 in New York City. Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nHe refused to take roles he felt were demeaning\n\nPoitier’s first movie was 1950’s “No Way Out,” a noir film in which he played a young doctor who must treat a racist patient. That led to increasingly prominent roles as a reverend in the apartheid drama “Cry, the Beloved Country,” a troubled student in “Blackboard Jungle” and an escaped prisoner in “The Defiant Ones,” in which he and Tony Curtis were shackled together and forced to get along to survive. With that 1958 film, Poitier became the first Black man to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nBut for a dark-skinned actor in the 1950s, finding complex roles was difficult.\n\n“(Blacks) were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,” Poitier told Winfrey. “I had in mind what was expected of me – not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.”\n\nSidney Poitier with Lilia Skala in 1963's \"Lilies of the Field.\" The role earned him an Oscar. Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nEarly on, Poitier made a conscious decision to reject roles that weren’t consistent with his values or that reflected badly upon his race. He told Winfrey that as a struggling young actor, he turned down a role that paid $750 a week because he didn’t like the character, a janitor who didn’t respond after thugs killed his daughter and threw her body on his lawn.\n\n“I could not imagine playing that part. So I said to myself, ‘That’s not the kind of work I want.’ And I told my agent that I couldn’t play the role,” Poitier said. “He said, ‘Why can’t you play it? There’s nothing derogatory about it in racial terms,’ and I said, ‘I can’t do it.’ He never understood.”\n\nStill, by the late 1950s, Poitier was landing regular acting work. He appeared in the first Broadway production of “A Raisin in the Sun” in 1959 and starred in the movie version two years later. Then came “Lilies of the Field,” biblical epic “The Greatest Story Ever Told” and the drama “A Patch of Blue,” in which his character had a chaste romance with a blind white woman.\n\nSpurred by his friendship with the more outspoken Belafonte, Poitier also began embracing the civil rights movement. He attended the 1963 March on Washington and in 1964 traveled to Mississippi to meet with activists in the days following the infamous slayings of three young civil rights workers.\n\nSidney Poitier during a break in filming of \"In the Heat of the Night\" on location in Tennessee on April 11, 1967. He said the role was one of the most intense he ever played. AP\n\nBut Poitier sometimes bristled when interviewers questioned him too much about his experiences with racism.\n\n“Racism was horrendous, but there were other aspects to life,” he told Winfrey. “There are those who allow their lives to be defined only by race. I correct anyone who comes at me only in terms of race.”\n\nA year like no other\n\nThen came 1967, and one of the most remarkable years any Hollywood star has had before or since. Poitier starred in three high-profile films, starting with “To Sir, With Love,” a British drama about an idealistic teacher who must win over rebellious teenagers in a tough East London school.\n\nBy this time, Poitier was commanding $1 million a movie, and the filmmakers weren’t sure they could afford to hire him. So they struck a deal to pay the actor scale – the minimum legal amount – in exchange for a percentage of the movie’s box-office grosses. Although common in Hollywood today, it was a radical idea at the time – and a savvy one for Poitier. “To Sir, With Love” became a big hit, earning him a huge payday.\n\nSidney Poitier with Rod Steiger on the set of \"In the Heat of the Night,\" directed by Norman Jewison. United Artists/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nNext up was Norman Jewison’s “In the Heat of the Night,” which gave Poitier his most enduring role. He played Virgil Tibbs, a homicide detective passing through Mississippi when he is detained by a bigoted White police chief (Rod Steiger) as a possible suspect in a slaying. Tibbs reluctantly agrees to stay and help solve the case, and the two men eventually find a grudging mutual respect.\n\nThe movie gave Poitier his most famous line – “They call me Mister Tibbs!” – an indignant cry for respect after a demeaning slur by Steiger’s character.\n\nIn another memorable scene, Tibbs is slapped in the face by a racist plantation owner and then slaps him right back. Before agreeing to do the film, Poitier requested a script change to add the retaliatory slap and even rewrote his contract to prohibit the studio from cutting the scene.\n\n“And of course it is one of those great, great moments in all of film, when you slap him back,” CBS News’ Lesley Stahl told Poitier in 2013. He replied, “Yes, I knew that I would have been insulting every Black person in the world (if I hadn’t).”\n\nPoitier followed that film with Stanley Kramer’s “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” another message movie about racial tolerance, in which his doctor character must persuade Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn’s characters to let him marry their daughter. The movie was released only six months after the Supreme Court made interracial marriage legal in all 50 states.\n\nSidney Poitier with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in a scene from the 1967 film, \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.\" Michael Ochs Archives/Moviepix/Getty Images\n\nHowever, around the same time some Black people began grumbling that Poitier’s saintly, non-sexualized characters bore little resemblance to the complex realities of African-American life. Black playwright Clifford Mason, in a 1967 New York Times column, argued that Poitier played essentially the same character in every movie: “a good guy in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman to love or kiss, helping the white man solve the white man’s problem.”\n\nThis criticism stung Poitier so much that he retreated to the Bahamas for months.\n\n“I lived through people turning on me. It was painful for a couple years. … I was the most successful Black actor in the history of the country,” Poitier told Winfrey. “The criticism I received was principally because I was usually the only Black in the movies. Personally, I thought that was a step (forward).”\n\nLater he became a director and turned to TV\n\nIn the 1970s, Poitier scaled back on acting and turned to directing, which he felt gave him more control over his film projects. He teamed up with his pal Belafonte for the Western “Buck and the Preacher,” his directorial debut. He directed and co-starred with Bill Cosby in the comedy caper “Uptown Saturday Night,” which, along with its spiritual sequels “Let’s Do It Again” and “A Piece of the Action,” featured largely Black casts.\n\nAnd in 1980, he directed “Stir Crazy,” the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder prison-break comedy, which became one of his biggest hits.\n\nSidney Poitier signals to the audience to sit after being presented with a Hall of Fame Tribute at the 32nd Annual NAACP Image Awards in Los Angeles in 2001. Lucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlthough he faded as a big box-office draw, Poitier continued to appear onscreen sporadically into the 1990s, most notably with Tom Berenger in the 1988 action-thriller “Shoot to Kill,” with Robert Redford in the 1992 caper film “Sneakers” and with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere in 1997’s “The Jackal,” his final film role.\n\nHe also belatedly turned to television, where he was nominated for Emmys for playing US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and South African leader Nelson Mandela in two miniseries. He also was considered for the role of President Josiah “Jed” Bartlet on TV’s “The West Wing,” which eventually went to Martin Sheen.\n\nBy 2000, Poitier had retired from acting, choosing instead to play golf and pen a memoir, “The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography,” in which he described his lifelong attempt to live according to principles instilled in him by his father and others he admired.\n\nIn his later years, as Hollywood sought to recognize a man whose example had opened doors for so many other Black actors, the accolades poured in. In 2001, Poitier received an honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema. The following year, in accepting his best actor Oscar for “Training Day,” Denzel Washington said, “Forty years I’ve been chasing Sidney. … I’ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I’ll always be following in your footsteps.”\n\nSidney Poitier at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar night party on March 2, 2014, in West Hollywood, California. Adrian Sanchez-Gonzalez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, President Obama awarded Poitier the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, saying, “It’s been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones … milestones of artistic excellence, milestones of America’s progress.”\n\nThe Film Society of Lincoln Center bestowed its highest award on Poitier in 2011. Among the speakers praising him was filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who said, “In the history of movies, there’ve only been a few actors who, once they gained recognition, their influence forever changed the art form.\n\n“There’s a time before their arrival, and there’s a time after their arrival. And after their arrival, nothing’s ever going to be the same again. As far as the movies are concerned, there was pre-Poitier, and there was Hollywood post-Poitier.”", "authors": ["Brandon Griggs"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/07/22/star-wars-jaws-titantic-hollywoods-high-grossing-films-inflation/1796847001/", "title": "Top 10 films at the box office when adjusted for inflation", "text": "Sarah Whitten\n\nCNBC\n\nAs “Avengers: Endgame” has raced its way to and beyond the highest-grossing film record held by “Avatar,” questions have arisen about how Hollywood determines what movie is considered the biggest earner.\n\nAfter all, “Avatar” was released in 2009, so wouldn’t a fairer comparison to 2019's “Endgame” be adjusted for inflation?\n\nWell, it’s not that simple.\n\nThere’s a reason the film industry doesn’t measure the success of modern movies against those of the past – movie ticket inflation isn’t an exact science. There are so many factors behind what makes a movie a box-office success and those factors have changed since the earliest days of cinema.\n\nFrom Hollywood to Seoul:How #MeToo is upending Asian entertainment industries\n\nDisney bought Marvel for $4 billion:It’s made over $18 billion since\n\nFor one, consumers have many more choices of what to spend their money on when it comes to entertainment. Even if you exclude sporting events, concerts and at-home entertainment such as streaming services and video games, just the sheer number of options of what movie to see in theaters is so much larger than 50 years ago.\n\nFor that reason, a film like “Gone With the Wind” sold more than 200 million tickets over the course of its initial release and additional seven re-releases in the U.S. For comparison, Disney’s “Endgame” sold around 94.8 million tickets domestically since its release in April.\n\nThe content of movies has also changed drastically. Three-hour dramas about the lives of Southerners during the Civil War wouldn’t be as popular in 2019 as they were in, say, 1939. So, it would be difficult to say with certainty that a film that thrived decades ago would still do so today.\n\nAnother major reason that Hollywood doesn’t adjust for inflation is the number of foreign markets films are now released in. Analysts would have to dive into each global market to determine the inflation rate in each country, a task that is nearly impossible considering most films are released in more than 100 markets during their initial run.\n\nStill, it’s an interesting exercise. So, CNBC contacted Comscore, a media measurement and analytics company, to work out how an adjusted figure could be determined. Paul Dergarabedian and his team devised a method wherein they divided the average ticket price for the year a film was released into the film’s gross to determine the estimated number of tickets the film would have sold. Of course, this gets tricky, especially considering so many high-grossing films are re-released long after their initial debut.\n\nFor instance, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” was released in theaters in 1937, 1983, 1987 and 1993. So for these films, Comscore used the average ticket price for each of those different years and divided them into the gross for each re-release.\n\nTo be sure, this isn’t a perfect method. Average ticket prices are just that, an average. There’s no way to break down the price of IMAX screenings and 3D screenings, or pricing based on region.\n\nNot to mention, ticket prices vary by year. In 2017, the average ticket price was $8.97. In 2018, it was $9.11. This year, it is $9.01. So if this adjustment had been done last year, the numbers would have been significantly higher.\n\nThat being said, here are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the U.S. if Hollywood did adjust the box office, based on modern ticket prices:\n\n10. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937)\n\nEstimated admissions: 109 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $982 million\n\nSince 1937, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” has garnered around $184.9 million at the domestic box office. The film was the first full-length animated feature from Disney.\n\nThe film has been re-released at least three times and made more money from those re-releases than it did from its initial 1937 release.\n\nComscore determined that since its debut, around 109 million tickets have been sold. At today’s average ticket price, the film would have made nearly $1 billion in the U.S.\n\n9. 'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nEstimated admissions: 116.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.04 billion\n\nOne of only six horror films to be nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, “The Exorcist” has hauled in more than $232.9 million since its 1973 debut.\n\nThe film made the bulk of its money during its initial release. It was brought back to theaters in 2000 and 2010 with extended scenes.\n\nAdjusted for today’s ticket prices, “The Exorcist,” which sold an estimated 116.5 million tickets, would have made around $1.04 billion.\n\n8. 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 124.6 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.12 billion\n\nReleased only in 1965, “Doctor Zhivago” earned $112.1 million during its run in theaters and won five Academy Awards.\n\nIt’s estimated that around 124.6 million tickets were sold for the film. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, that would be around $1.12 billion at the box office.\n\n7. 'Jaws' (1975)\n\nEstimated admissions: 128 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.15 billion\n\nSteven Spielberg’s “Jaws” was released in theaters in 1975 and earned $260 million. Like “The Exorcist,” it is one of six horror movies to be nominated for best picture. It did not win the award, however.\n\nComscore estimates that around 128 million tickets were sold during the film’s run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.15 billion at the box office.\n\n6. 'The Ten Commandments' (1956)\n\nEstimated admissions: 131 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.18 billion\n\nThe 3-hour-and-40-minute feature debuted in 1956 and earned $65.5 million.\n\nThe iconic film, which featured famed actors Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses II, sold an estimated 131 million tickets during its run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.18 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n5. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nEstimated admissions: 143.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.29 billion\n\n“Titanic” is regarded as one of the best films in industry history and is also one of the highest-grossing. Without adjusting for inflation, James Cameron’s masterpiece is the sixth highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the third-highest grossing film globally.\n\nThe film has been re-released twice in addition to its initial run, once in 3D and once to celebrate its 20th anniversary. During those runs, the film earned $658.6 million domestically.\n\nIt’s estimated that “Titanic” sold around 143.5 million tickets. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.29 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n4. 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' (1982)\n\nEstimated admissions: 147.9 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.33 billion\n\nThe four-time Academy Award-winning “E.T.” hauled in $434.9 million since it was first released in 1982. Although it was re-released twice, once in 1985 and once in 2002, the film made the bulk of its earnings during its debut.\n\n“E.T.” sold an estimated 147.9 million tickets, which translated to around $1.33 billion in ticket sales using today’s average ticket price.\n\n3. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 157.2 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.41 billion\n\n“The Sound of Music” was released twice in theaters. Once was its 1965 debut, where it made the bulk of its $158.8 million haul in the U.S., the other was a 2018 re-release.\n\nComscore estimated that the film, which won five Academy Awards, sold around 157.2 million tickets. That is around $1.41 billion when adjusted for today’s ticket prices.\n\n2. 'Star Wars' (1977)\n\nEstimated admissions: 178.1 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.6 billion\n\n1977′s blockbuster “Star Wars” has been reissued at least twice since its initial debut and has earned $460.9 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nIn the last four decades, the film has sold an estimated 178.1 million tickets, which equates to around $1.6 billion at the modern domestic box office.\n\n1. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nEstimated admissions: 201 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.81 billion\n\n“Gone With the Wind” has been re-released at least seven times since its initial debut in 1939, Comscore said.

Several days after Putin’s draft order, he bid his grandmother a tearful farewell and left his home in Moscow – potentially forever.\n\nVadim, 28, an engineer from Moscow. Rebecca Wright/CNN\n\nVadim and his friend Alexei traveled as fast as they could to Russia’s border with the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, where they waited in line for three days to cross.\n\n“We ran away from Russia because we want to live,” Alexei says. “We are afraid that we can be sent to Ukraine.”\n\nBoth men asked not to be identified, to protect loved ones left behind in Russia.\n\nLast week, in Kazakhstan’s commercial capital Almaty, they stood in line with more than 150 other recently-arrived Russians outside a government registration center – part of an exodus of draft dodgers.\n\nRussian arrivals queuing at a registration center in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

Every hour, it seems, young Slavic men emerge from the train wearing backpacks, looking slightly dazed while consulting their phones for directions.\n\nThey arrive from cities across Russia: Yaroslavl, Togliati, St. Petersburg, Kazan. When asked why they have left they all say the same thing: mobilization.\n\n“It’s not something I want to participate in,” says a 30-year old computer programmer named Sergei. He sat on a bench outside the train station with his wife, Irina.

According to the Kremlin, Russia is conducting a “special military operation” against its Ukrainian neighbor.\n\nRussian citizens are currently able to enter Kazakhstan for short periods with their national ID cards – and the Central Asian country’s President has urged his compatriots to welcome the new arrivals.\n\n“Most of them are forced to leave because of the hopeless situation. We must take care of them and ensure their safety,” said President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in late September.\n\nAn informal grassroots effort has sprung up across Kazakhstan to help temporarily feed and house the Russians.\n\n“They are running, they are afraid,” says Ekaterina Korotkaya, an Almaty-based journalist who helped coordinate assistance to newly-arrived Russians.\n\nAlmira Orlova, a nutritionist based in Almaty, says she has helped find housing for at least 26 Russians.\n\n“They would arrive to my apartment, stay for a while, then stay in the apartments of my friends,” she says.\n\nBut she points out that she did not receive the same hospitality when she moved with her Russian husband to Moscow several years ago.\n\nThen, Russian landlords repeatedly refused to rent her apartments because she was “Asian,” she said.\n\n“When I told them that I’m Kazakh, they said ‘I’m sorry I really cannot.’ And we weren’t able to find an apartment for two months,” Orlova says.\n\n“Citizens of Central Asia who went to Russia for labor migration purposes face some serious discrimination in Russia,” says Kadyr Toktogulov, former ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to the United States and Canada.\n\nThe former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan has also seen a large “reverse migration” of Russians fleeing the draft.\n\n“I don’t think that Russians coming to Central Asia that are fleeing the draft will be having the same kind of problems or facing the kind of discrimination that citizens of Central Asian republics have been facing for years in Russia,” says Toktogulov.\n\nToktogulov says his own family recently rented out an apartment in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek to a newly-arrived Russian man.\n\nBrain drain\n\nReal estate experts say the flood of Russian exiles have already sent rents skyrocketing in Almaty, the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek and other cities in the region.\n\nThe impact is also being felt in commercial real estate, as many Russians seek to work remotely.\n\n“It’s not only individuals coming, the big [Russian] companies and corporate business, they are moving their companies to Kazakhstan,” says Madina Abilpanova, a managing partner at DM Associates, a real estate firm based in Almaty.\n\nMadina Abilpanova, managing partner at DM Associates in Almaty.

Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly called for Bout’s release, slamming his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased.”\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry said Thursday that Bout was returned to Russia after the exchange at Abu Dhabi Airport. Footage shared by Russian state television later showed Bout walking on a tarmac in Abu Dhabi, then boarding and sitting down inside a plane, which later landed in Moscow.\n\n“For a long time, the Russian Federation has been negotiating with the United States on the release of V. A. Bout,” the ministry said in a statement. “Washington categorically refused dialogue on the inclusion of the Russian [citizen] in the exchange scheme. Nevertheless, the Russian Federation continued to actively work to rescue our compatriot.”\n\nIt added that as a result of Russia’s negotiations with the US, Bout had been “returned to his homeland.”\n\nBout’s US lawyer, Steve Zissou, said that Bout was with his wife and daughter. “We are grateful that after 15 long years, Viktor has finally been reunited with his family,” he added.\n\nGriner – who had for years played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nThe swap, which US President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16-years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair.\n\nGriner and Whelan’s families had urged the White House to secure their release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary.\n\nAt the center of their bid was Bout, a man who eluded international arrest warrants and asset freezes for years.\n\nOn the same day, Griner testified in Russian court as part of her ongoing trial on drug charges following her February arrest at a Moscow airport. Whelan was arrested on alleged espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16-years in prison in a trial that US officials have called unfair.\n\nThe Russian businessman, who speaks six languages, was arrested in a sting operation in 2008 led by US drug enforcement agents in Thailand posing as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the acronym FARC. He was eventually extradited to the US in 2010 after a protracted court proceeding.\n\n“Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,” said Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan when Bout was sentenced in New York in 2012.\n\n“He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans.”\n\nThe trial honed in on Bout’s role in supplying weapons to FARC, a guerrilla group that waged an insurgency in Colombia until 2016. The US said the weapons were intended to kill US citizens.\n\nBut Bout’s history in the arms trade extended much further afield. He has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s, fueling bloody conflicts from Liberia to Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted US authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and blocked any US transactions.\n\nBout has repeatedly maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and acted as a mere logistics provider. He is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents.\n\nViktor Bout is pictured in a temporary cell ahead of a hearing at a court in Bangkok in August 2010. Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“His early days are a mystery,” Douglas Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center who co-authored a book on Bout, told CNN in 2010.\n\nFarah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. He said that Bout graduated from the Military Institute on Foreign Languages, a well-known feeder school for Russian military intelligence.\n\n“He was a Soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the USSR and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from Moscow to Kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional Soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from Africa to the Philippines,” Farah told the magazine.\n\nBout has said that he worked as a military officer in Mozambique. Others have said it was actually Angola, where Russia had a large military presence at the time, Farah told CNN. He first became known when the United Nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the United States began to get involved.\n\nBout – who reportedly has used names including “Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,” “Victor But,” “Viktor Butt,” “Viktor Bulakin” and “Vadim Markovich Aminov” – is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms-dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie “Lord of War.”\n\nIn 2002, CNN’s Jill Dougherty met with Bout in Moscow. She asked him about allegations against him – did he sell arms to the Taliban? To al Qaeda? Did he supply rebels in Africa and get paid in blood diamonds? – and he denied each claim.\n\n“It’s a false allegation and it’s a lie,” he said. “I’ve never touched diamonds in my life and I’m not a diamond guy and I don’t want that business.”\n\n“I’m not afraid,” he told Dougherty. “I didn’t do anything in my life I should be afraid of.”", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/brittney-griner-released/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner, WNBA star, released from Russian detention in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention, President Joe Biden said Thursday.\n\nGriner was released in a prisoner swap that involved Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\n“She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home,” Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner’s wife, Cherelle. “After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that Griner’s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan’s family “have to have such mixed emotions today.”\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nGriner’s February arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the same time that the US enacted crippling sanctions in response to the Ukraine war, US diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations to try to secure the release of both Griner and Whelan.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said.\n\nThe prisoner swap occurred in Abu Dhabi Thursday, according to senior Biden administration officials. A joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nAsked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next “24 hours.” As for what he would say to Whelan’s family, he said, “We’re speaking to them.”\n\nCherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”\n\nBoth she and Brittney Griner “will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,” she added.\n\nThe Griner family echoed those sentiments in a statement Thursday night.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers - including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the family said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch President Biden give remarks after Brittney Griner release 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nWhelan told CNN in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where is being held in a remote part of Russia that he was “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far – and didn’t rule out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.”\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\n“This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,” tweeted House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable.”\n\nGriner – who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\n‘The only deal we could make right now’\n\nMonths and months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in Thursday’s prisoner swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in recent weeks that an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s release.\n\nThe final deal itself came together over the past 48 hours, the officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence.\n\nThat opening, while a significant breakthrough, was still a “painful” one, the officials said: in exchange for a convicted arms dealer, Russia would only agree to release Griner, leaving another American – Whelan – behind. In multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nBiden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official said. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brittney Griner's wife speaks about WNBA star's release 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said, because Russia said it has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.\n\nThe Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nIn the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.\n\n“It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,” the US official said.\n\nThe official says that was a “difficult decision” for Biden, but again, one he felt he had to make.\n\nGriner was moved from the penal colony to Moscow within the last 48 hours. Thursday morning, she boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates. Upon arriving there, she was met on the tarmac by US officials, including special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens. She was in “an extremely upbeat mood” and “all smiles” and “grateful.”\n\nWhelan family ‘devastated’\n\nWhelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a “sweatshop.”\n\nWhelan’s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are “devastated” that he was left behind.\n\n“It’s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, said on “CNN This Morning.” “But we do worry about what’s in Paul’s future. I think it’s become clear that the US doesn’t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I’m not really sure what the future holds.”\n\nThe Biden administration told Whelan’s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.\n\nIn an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was “devastated” at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won’t survive the rest of his sentence.\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news, according to senior administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, after the US secured the release of Trevor Reed, another American who’d been detained in Russia since 2019, Paul Whelan expressed frustration through a statement shared by his parents.\n\n“Why was I left behind?” Whelan said in April. “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in Russia 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of Death’ included in swap\n\nBout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nIt was a US decision to have the exchange happen in Abu Dhabi, an official familiar with the discussion said. “Russia was happy with it,” then UAE facilitated and provided the venue.\n\nWhen Putin and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, met in Russia in October, one of the issues they discussed was prisoner exchanges, and there was an agreement that the UAE could be helpful on the topic, a senior UAE official told CNN.\n\nThe US was aware that MBZ planned to raise the topic with Putin and there was nothing but encouragement from the US side, the official said.\n\n“There was criticism of the Putin meeting at the time. But that meeting is part of the reason that Griner was released today,” the official said.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Biden thanked the United Arab Emirates for its help with the exchange.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap. The statement said that the “success of the mediation efforts is a reflection of the mutual and solid friendship that connects both countries with the United States of America, and the Russian Federation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch interview with Viktor Bout 13 years ago from Thai jail after US sting operation 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked about the role of Saudi Arabia, US officials suggested a number of countries were involved.\n\n“We have and I’m sure we’ll continue to lean on partners around the world to work this through with us and to give us their ideas and to impress upon the Russians how important it is to us to resolve these sorts of cases.

The Biden administration had been working to secure Griner’s release along with another American, Paul Whelan, who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. CNN first reported in July that a potential deal for a prisoner exchange of Bout for Griner and Whelan had been offered by the Biden administration.\n\nHere is what we know about Griner’s detention and the prisoner exchange that resulted in her release.\n\nWhy was she jailed and where was she being held?\n\nGriner, 32, was arrested on February 17, 2022, after having less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage while at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and Russian authorities accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance, which the Russian government says is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nGriner’s lawyers told Russian judges during a hearing in July that the cannabis oil was medically prescribed for “severe chronic pain,” and not for recreational use. She pleaded guilty to the charges in July and one month later was convicted and sentenced to nine years in jail. Her attorneys appealed the conviction in October and asked for a more lenient sentence but a Russian judge upheld her conviction while modifying her sentence to count the time she spent in pretrial detention after her February 17 arrest.\n\nAfter being held in a detention center in Iksha, in November she was transferred to a penal colony in Yavas in the western Russian region of Mordovia.\n\nThere had been concern about the health and well being of Griner, who is Black and a lesbian, while detained in Russia. Though Russia decriminalized homosexuality in 1993, homophobia and discrimination still persists. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill that expanded anti-LGBTQ laws.\n\nConditions vary among Russian penal colonies, but political prisoners are often placed in harsh conditions where they can be subjected to “solitary confinement or punitive stays in psychiatric units,” according to a recent human rights report from the US State Department. Russian law also allows forced labor in penal colonies, and in some cases, inmates have been tortured to death, the report says. There also are reports of prison authorities recruiting inmates to abuse other inmates, the report also says.\n\nHow did her release come about?\n\nThe prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, Russian state media said. Saudi Arabia and the UAE said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap.\n\nThe Biden administration had been working to secure Griner’s release in a two-for-one exchange with Whelan, but the Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said. That is because Russia has been handling their cases differently based on what each person has been accused of. The Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of the deal with Griner, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter has told CNN, adding that the president was updated on the swap as it took place.\n\nA senior administration official also told CNN Griner’s release was the right deal to make, while adding that it was “the only deal we could make right now.”\n\nThe decision to exchange Griner for a figure nicknamed the “Merchant of Death” is controversial. Bout, a former Soviet military officer, was serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nWhat’s next for Griner now that she has been released?\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nThough White House officials have said Griner is in “good spirits” she is likely to undergo a thorough medical evaluation. National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby told CNN on Thursday the first priority right now is “to make sure that she gets the adequate care she needs” after being detained and under “intolerable conditions.”\n\n“We suspect that there will be a need here for her to have access to proper health care before she’s ready and fit to get back home. I don’t think that that will take a very long time,” Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “But again, that is going to be up to the doctors to work with the family on. That is going to be the main focus now, is just making sure that we look after her well being before she’s able to, you know, to get on her way.”\n\nWhat has Paul Whelan said?\n\nThe former marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen and was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 for allegedly being involved in an intelligence operation, on Thursday told CNN he was happy that Griner was released but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where he is being held in a remote part of Russia, Whelan also told CNN he was surprised not to have been included in the swap with Bout and that he is “greatly disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release.\n\n“I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four year anniversary of my arrest is coming up. I was arrested for a crime that never occurred,” he said. “I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here.”", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/biden-griner-whelan-decision/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: Inside Biden's agonizing decision to take a deal that ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden had already personally informed Cherelle Griner that her wife was being released from Russian detention when aides arrived with more news: Brittney Griner was now securely out of Russia – and on the telephone.\n\n“It’s Joe Biden,” the president said when the call was patched through. “Welcome, welcome home!”\n\nNearly ten months after Brittney Griner was arrested at a Moscow airport, the jubilant moment in the Oval Office on Thursday amounted to the culmination of prolonged, frustrating negotiations and one painful decision that left another detained American disappointed and wondering what his fate may be.\n\nIn conversations across an array of government channels, Russian officials were clear with their American counterparts: they would release Griner – and only Griner – in exchange for a convicted Russian arms dealer nicknamed the “merchant of death.”\n\nBecause of the matter’s exceedingly high profile, it was certain those conditions had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, one US official said.\n\nDespite Biden’s attempts to link Griner’s case to that of Paul Whelan, a former US Marine arrested on espionage charges in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison two years later, it became plain recently that Putin would not budge.\n\n“The choice was bringing Brittney Griner home right now, or bringing no one home right now,” one senior administration official said.\n\nWith winter approaching at the penal colony where Griner was being held, Biden faced a singularly presidential decision. Welcoming Griner home would fulfill a promise and end the nightmare endured by her and her family.\n\nBut any victory would be tempered by the inability to secure Whelan’s freedom and inevitable blowback over the release of one the most prolific arms dealers of the past decades.\n\nThe situation was complicated further when senior law enforcement officials, angry at the prospect of releasing a notorious figure it had taken years to capture and alarmed by the precedent Bout’s release would set, raised strong objections.\n\nBiden took the deal.\n\n“Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones and – and she should have been there all along,” the president said from the Roosevelt Room, where he was joined by Griner’s wife. “This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time.”\n\nMoments earlier in Abu Dhabi, Griner had stepped from her transport plane into the Middle East air – fifty degrees warmer than Moscow – and smiled, a US official said.\n\nDeal comes together\n\nBy the start of this week, US officials had grown confident a resolution to Griner’s case was not only possible, but probable. Biden gave final approval to the parameters of the deal and set in motion the prisoner swap.\n\nThe decision was shared with only a tight knit group of US officials to prevent the news from breaking before Griner was in US custody, one US official explained. US officials were concerned about Russia pulling back on the promise after repeated warnings from the Kremlin that the matter should not be discussed in public. They were also cognizant of the ongoing war in Ukraine, wary that any major escalations had the potential to derail the plan. So concerned were White House officials that the fragile deal could collapse that Biden didn’t sign the commutation papers for Bout until Griner was on the ground in Abu Dhabi and in the sight of a US greeting party.\n\nGriner’s wife, who arrived in Washington on Wednesday, was invited to an early morning meeting at the White House set for Thursday. She was initially scheduled to meet with national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who had briefed her several times over the course of the negotiations.\n\nGriner, by that point, had been moved from the penal colony where she’d been held to Moscow: a concrete sign of an imminent resolution. When Cherelle Griner arrived at the White House for the meeting with Sullivan, it had become apparent the critical question was no longer if her wife would be released, but when.\n\nCherelle Griner waited at the White House for a short period of time before it became clear the planned meeting with Sullivan had shifted. One person in particular wanted to deliver the official news that Griner’s nearly 10-month ordeal had come to an end.\n\nShe was led into the Oval Office, where Biden was waiting to tell her Griner was officially on her way home.\n\nGriner’s flight to freedom marked a moment officials acknowledged was only the first step of what will likely be a difficult and emotionally jarring process for the professional athlete in the weeks and months ahead. A range of support programs, developed across the US government over years to address the needs of detainees and hostages returning to US, have been prepared for Griner to utilize.\n\nBiden, who has been briefed on what may lie ahead, according to officials, made his own public plea as he announced Griner’s release.\n\n“The fact remains that she’s lost months of her life, experienced a needless trauma, and she deserves space, privacy, and time with her loved ones to recover and heal from her time being wrongfully detained,” he said.\n\nCases intertwined\n\nA star athlete with an outspoken wife and a dedicated base of supporters, including several fellow celebrities, Griner’s case captured public attention and heaped pressure on Biden to secure her release over the past year. The White House described her suffering “intolerable circumstances” during her detention. And there had been concern about the health and wellbeing of Griner, who is Black and a lesbian, while detained in Russia.\n\nHer case also served to amplify the plight of Whelan, whose arrest on espionage charges led to a conviction in 2020 and a 16-year prison sentence. US officials have called the trial unfair and say the charges are manufactured.\n\nIn July, Griner wrote a letter to Biden saying she was “terrified I might be here forever.” She asked him to do all he could to bring her home. At the White House, Biden met with Griner’s wife for the first time to show her the letter he was sending in response.\n\nIt was later that month the White House made the unusual decision to reveal publicly it had placed a significant offer on the table to secure both Griner’s and Whelan’s release. For Griner and Whelan, they were willing to exchange Viktor Bout, who was convicted in 2011 on charges including conspiring to kill American citizens.\n\nAmerican officials voiced intense frustration that Russia seemed to reject the proposal.\n\nBehind the scenes, Russian officials told their counterparts that releasing two detained Americans for one Russian prisoner was a non-starter. Yet when American officials sought to raise other options that would secure Whelan’s release alongside Griner’s, they were met with significant resistance.\n\nA senior administration official said the US had “tried to articulate other options, other categories of options, to create the space to really have the haggling that we want to have,” describing the other categories as involving individuals in US custody.\n\n“If you’re haggling, you’re getting closer,” the official said. “And instead we have had no change or softening of a response that is simply a demand for something we just can’t provide because it’s not something in our control.”\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news. Another senior US official spoke at length Thursday with Whelan himself.\n\nIn a phone call with CNN on Thursday, Whelan voiced his frustration that more has not been done to secure his release.\n\n“I was arrested for a crime that never occurred,” he said from the penal colony where he is being held in a remote part of Russia. “I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here.”\n\nPaul Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth Whelan spoke with Biden on Thursday afternoon, she told CNN.\n\nShe described it as a “good call.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback John Kirby lays out reasons why Griner case was different from Whelan 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of death’\n\nAs the outlines of the deal emerged over the past week, White House officials briefed other US government agencies that the Russians would only agree to swap Bout for Griner. Justice Department officials, who were always opposed to releasing Bout, expressed frustration that an earlier deal that included Whelan had, in their view, gotten worse.\n\nOne official said law enforcement officials raised strenuous objections but were told the decision had been made. For law enforcement officials from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which spent years and elaborate efforts to try to capture Bout, the release of Bout raised additional concerns about the precedent the deal could set.\n\nThe Biden administration conducted a security assessment in the lead-up to Biden giving the final green light to accept the deal to trade Griner for Bout. Ultimately, the assessment’s conclusion was that “Bout was not a security threat to the US,” a US official told CNN.\n\nOne reality the assessment took into account, the official said, is the fact that Bout has been in prison for over a decade and has not been actively engaged in any recent criminal activity.\n\nOther than to say that the security assessment conducted on Bout was “thorough,” the official would not elaborate further on how the US was able to be certain that the Russian arms dealer wouldn’t pose a future risk to the country.\n\nThe publicity surrounding Griner, including celebrities posting criticism of the Biden White House on social media for not moving more quickly to secure her release, appeared to raise the Russian price for Griner’s release, law enforcement officials said.\n\nThat added to concerns that the deal increases the likelihood that Russia, Iran and other countries could use the arrest of Americans to try to use the publicity to gain concessions the US otherwise wouldn’t give.\n\nSpeaking Thursday, an administration official rejected the notion that Bout’s release set a new precedent for securing the release of Americans and said hostile governments would be mistaken if they interpreted Thursday’s swap that way.\n\n“Any inference that somehow this has become the norm would be mistaken, and I don’t think governments around the world would be wise to draw that inference,” the official said. “But in the rare case when there is an imperative to Americans home, which is a real priority for this president, there sometimes are no alternatives left, and a heavy price has to be paid.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2022/12/08/brittney-griner-released-from-russia-prisoner-swap-for-viktor-bout/69711353007/", "title": "Brittney Griner released from Russia in prisoner swap for Viktor Bout", "text": "Phoenix Mercury center and WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian penal colony and is in United States custody after a prisoner exchange for arms dealer Viktor Bout, President Biden confirmed Thursday morning.\n\nSenior administration officials said Griner had been released from the penal colony within the last 48 hours and taken to Moscow before flying to the United Arab Emirates and is currently on her way back to the United States.\n\nCBS News was first to report the exchange.\n\nIn a news conference at the White House, Biden said the exchange had been in the works for the past two weeks, and that he had given the final go-ahead.

Griner was sentenced to a Russian penal colony for possession of a single gram of cannabis oil. Bout is allegedly the most prolific arms dealer of the past decades, fuelling conflicts in Africa and beyond – and more specifically being convicted in a US court of plotting to kill Americans.\n\nBut the circumstances and political pressure on both sides reversed this imbalance. Griner gained a significance to Americans – based on her claims of innocence and her blatant seizure as a geopolitical pawn on the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – that mandated the Biden administration to begin negotiations with the Kremlin at the worst point of US-Russian relations since at least the end of the Cold War.\n\nBout’s outsized importance to Russia has always been the bigger puzzle. How can one man be so valuable to Moscow they spend decades seeking his release at whatever level they can, and also be just an innocent and unfortunate global pilot and tradesman, as he has claimed? Who is this guy who denies everything?\n\nI interviewed Bout in 2009 after months of negotiations while he was imprisoned in Bangkok. He is a polyglot who is loquacious, charming and can rhapsodize endlessly about the list of political characters he has personal relationships with globally.\n\nI have seen videos of Bout in the Congo and across Africa, where he was pretty close to the conflicts there. He is accused, by multiple analysts and UN investigations, of proliferating small arms across that continent during the 90s and early 00s, which he denied. There were accusations he even armed al Qaeda, which he also denied. There was little he was not accused of doing, and few things he didn’t deny. He became a bogeyman of sorts, and the focus of a film starring Nicolas Cage called “Lord of War.”\n\nThat is the career history: the reputation as the man who became known as the “Merchant of Death.” What he spent 14 years in jail for, and was extradited to the United States over, was a complex sting by the US Drug Enforcement Agency, in which he was duped into agreeing to supply weapons to US agents pretending to be Colombian terrorists – weapons intended in the sting to kill Americans. It is an oddity that after all the crimes Bout was accused of, the one he did jail time for was a conspiracy – a plot, rather than an act.\n\nFor sure, he is a pilot and an entrepreneur. He was a military translator with a Soviet past. But there are allegations he worked in Russian intelligence and became an asset for them in the supply of weapons around the world to bolster Moscow’s geopolitical aims. There were suggestions too that he had served alongside senior Russians who are now close to President Vladimir Putin. This might have explained the intensity with which the Americans sought him. He was never a nobody.\n\nThere was always a curious mystique to Bout and his entourage. Yes, he was innocent, of everything, he would say. But also yes, he had had an interesting life. There was always the wink-wink you often get when someone knows there is more to a story than is being said openly.\n\nThe larger surprise today is how this exchange happened during the Russian invasion and brutalizing of Ukraine. It says two things: that Moscow and Washington are able to do business even as Russian bombs kill innocent Ukrainian civilians, and the United States provides arms to Ukraine that are killing Russian soldiers, and that nuclear powers can work on other thorny issues while bullets are flying. This is a good thing for everyone on the planet. It means some cool heads prevail, and basic interests win out.\n\nIt also shows some weakness on the side of Putin. At a time when he is hawkishly flaunting nuclear rhetoric against the West, he is also agreeing to high profile diplomatic deal to get back a figure of outsized, complex importance to Russia’s elite, the intelligence community, and national pride.\n\nThis is a man who many ordinary Russians may have heard of, and he certainly is of mythological importance to the Russian elite. He is not someone Moscow would – to paraphrase the ugly slogan of Russia’s invasion in which hundreds of soldiers’ bodies have remained strewn on the battlefield – “leave behind.”\n\nThese are the very people that Putin wants to curry favor with now. The deal may also have been more self-serving: Many believe that when Bout served in Africa, he had close ties to members of the Russian elite now close to Putin (though Bout has denied this too). Was this why the US spent such time and money to detain him? Did they think he would turn? We may never know.\n\nYes, it is a win for Putin, but one that comes at the cost of exposing his weakness and his need to keep the military elite he relies upon content.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the number of years Bout spent in jail following the DEA sting operation in 2008.", "authors": ["Nick Paton Walsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/us/brittney-griner-us-arrival-monday/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner is back in the US and dunking again after almost 10 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFresh off her elated return to the US after months in Russian custody, two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is back on a basketball court.\n\nBut her reintegration into American life is far from over, as is the fight by WNBA players for equity as US professional athletes. The issue was highlighted by the 10-month detention of Griner, who’d gone to Russia to play basketball in the WNBA offseason.\n\nGriner’s first move on a Texas basketball court Sunday was a dunk, her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told CNN on Monday.\n\nConfirming news first reported by ESPN, Colas said Griner wore a pair of black Chuck Taylor shoes, Phoenix Suns shorts and a T-shirt touting Title IX as she played. Months ago, in pre-trial detention in Russia, Griner was offered a basketball and a hoop, but she declined to play, Colas said.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say that her picking up a ball voluntarily and the first thing being a dunk … it was really encouraging,” Colas said. “She was really excited.”\n\nThe 32-year-old had arrived two days earlier at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio for routine evaluation after her release Thursday from what US officials deemed wrongful detention. She was freed amid Russia’s war in Ukraine in a prisoner swap for notorious convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nIt’s not clear how long Griner will stay at the medical center, Colas said.\n\n“She’s had a lot of psychological support,” Colas said. “The resources are very robust. It’s very supportive and very BG centered. It’s about her developing agency.”\n\nGriner’s agent believes she will try to “utilize her fame for good” but did not detail what that would look like. Colas said Griner opted into the Department of Defense’s Post Isolation Support Activities, or PISA, program that has served other wrongfully detained Americans.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether the Phoenix Mercury center will return to the WNBA. The 2023 regular season begins May 19, with training camps typically opening a month before.\n\n“If she wants to play, it will be for her to share,” Colas told ESPN’s T.J. Quinn. “She has the holidays to rest and decide what’s next without any pressure. She’s doing really, really well. She seems to have endured this in pretty incredible ways.”\n\nBut the fact that Griner typically plays basketball in Russia during her WNBA offseasons highlights the inequities faced by professional female athletes in the US, fellow WNBA players said.\n\nFor many years, WNBA players have spent their offseasons playing in international leagues, where they often can earn more money.\n\n“We’ve been talking about the pay disparity for a long time, and players have been going overseas for a long time,” Elizabeth Williams, a Washington Mystics player and secretary for the Women’s National Basketball Players Association, told CNN on Monday.\n\n“I think this is when people are realizing … the dangers and perils of people going overseas and the impact of what those pay equity issues are.”\n\n‘A horrendous experience’\n\nBrittney Griner spent most of the 18-hour flight from Russia speaking with a US presidential envoy for hostage affairs. RIA\n\nGriner was arrested on drug charges at a Russian airport in February and sentenced to nine years in prison. As concerns grew that Griner was being used as a political pawn, efforts to negotiate her release took months.\n\nNow back on US soil, it’s not clear how long Griner will stay in Texas for medical evaluation.\n\n“I’m understanding that it’s going to be a few more days before she gets out,” former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson told CNN on Sunday.\n\nRichardson and his center privately work on behalf of families of hostages and detainees. He previously traveled to Russia to discuss Griner’s release, as well as Paul Whelan, a US Marine veteran who was wrongfully detained and remains in custody.\n\nRichardson said it’s important to give former detainees like Griner ample time to get settled.\n\n“We’ve got to give them a little space, a little time to readjust because they’ve had a horrendous experience in these Russian prisons,” said Richardson, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations in the Clinton administration.\n\nWhile held in a Russian penal colony, Griner was unable to perform the work done by many female prisoners due to her size, Griner’s Russian lawyer Maria Blagovolina told ESPN and confirmed to CNN.\n\nMost of the women in the penal colony worked sewing uniforms, but the 6-foot-9 Griner was too tall to sit at a work table, and her hands were too big to manage the sewing. So instead, she carried fabric all day, her attorney said.\n\n‘I’m here to take you home’\n\nOn the day of her release, Griner had a feeling she would be going home, said Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, who led the prisoner exchange mission in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut it didn’t feel real until he boarded the plane and told her: “On behalf of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, I’m here to take you home,” Carstens recalled to CNN.\n\nHe described Griner as an intelligent, compassionate, humble and patriotic person who immediately wanted to thank all the crew members who helped her.\n\n“When she finally got onto the US plane, I said, ‘Brittney, you must have been through a lot over the last 10 months. Here’s your seat. Please feel free to decompress. We’ll give you your space,’” Carstens recalled.\n\n“And she said, ‘Oh no. I’ve been in prison for 10 months now listening to Russian, I want to talk. But first of all, who are these guys?’ And she moved right past me and went to every member on that crew, looked them in the eyes, shook their hands and asked about them and got their names, making a personal connection with them. It was really amazing,” Carstens said.\n\nGriner spent 12 hours of an 18-hour flight talking with Carstens “about everything under the sun,” he said.\n\nWhen the government plane landed at Kelly Field, the person who emerged from the plane looked very different. Her long, signature dreadlocks had been cut while in captivity. Griner continuously battled the flu while detained because her hair kept freezing and she was unable to dry them, Colas said.\n\nThe new do was not a surprise to her family, though, as she sent word home weeks earlier about her decision to cut her hair, Colas said.\n\nIn San Antonio this weekend, she received a real hair cut to clean up her “Russian fade” as her friends and family jokingly call it. After that, she hit the basketball court.\n\nA challenging journey ahead\n\nGriner’s life has been forever altered, and adjusting to everyday life could be difficult.\n\nJorge Toledo – one of the “Citgo 6” – was released in October as part of a prisoner swap after being detained during a 2017 business trip to Venezuela with other oil and gas executives from the Citgo Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAfter returning home, Toledo told CNN, he’s had trouble sleeping and felt anxiety during normally mundane tasks such as driving.\n\nBut Toledo said he was part of a program in San Antonio that involved six days with a group of psychologists. He said the program was “extremely important” for his reintegration and hopes Griner can take advantage of similar resources.\n\nWhelan still held in Russia ‘for totally illegitimate reasons’\n\nWhile many celebrate Griner’s return, the fate of another American held in Russia remains uncertain.\n\nWhelan – a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen – is imprisoned in a Russian penal colony after he was arrested in December 2018 on espionage charges, which he has denied. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nWith Griner back in the US, Richardson said he’s optimistic about Whelan’s release – noting Russia previously offer a trade for Whelan.\n\nThe US tried to persuade Russia to swap both Griner and Whelan for Bout, but Russian officials would not budge on the matter. Russia said the Americans’ cases were handled differently based on the charges each of them faced.\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said last week. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nWhelan said he was happy Griner was released, but told CNN, “I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up.”\n\nGriner is eager to use power and influence to help others, her agent said, especially Whelan.\n\n“It was one of the first things she asked me about,” Colas said. “She’s very, very concerned about that. And will be sending a message to Paul.”", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Holly Yan", "Nouran Salahieh", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/us/brittney-griner-release-us-arrival-friday/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner in 'good spirits' and getting an evaluation at a US ...", "text": "San Antonio CNN —\n\nFor the first time in almost 300 days, Brittney Griner, the American basketball star detained by Russian authorities in February, will spend the night in a bed in her home country.\n\nGriner, 32, returned to the United States early Friday after being released from custody in an exchange for an international arms dealer.\n\nGriner was “in good spirits” and “incredibly gracious,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.\n\nTexas Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said on CNN Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a WNBA superstar, was able to call her father from the plane.\n\n“They all want to see her and might even want to see her back here at home, but I know that was a happy phone reunion to hear his daughter’s voice,” Jackson Lee said.\n\nGriner went to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for a routine evaluation, a State Department official told CNN.\n\nThe facility will be a big change from the penal colony where her life was “grueling,” according to Jackson Lee, and according to one of her Russian lawyers, made more miserable by her unusual size.\n\nGriner’s release was secured after a prisoner swap between the US and Russia, which involved international arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was arrested in 2008 in Thailand and extradited to the US in 2010.\n\nBout’s commutation was finalized only after US officials on Thursday saw Griner on the Abu Dhabi airport tarmac where the exchange happened, the White House said; President Joe Biden had signed Bout’s official commutation on December 2, the document posted on the Justice Department website shows.\n\nA joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nThe exchange is not a sign of improvements in US-Russian relations, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday.\n\nGriner’s arrest and conviction played out against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and added further attention to the plights of other Americans in Russian custody, including Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. Whelan’s release could not be secured in the latest prisoner swap, while Reed returned to the US in April after a nearly three-year ordeal.\n\nThe Biden administration will continue negotiating with Russia to secure Whelan’s release, it said Friday. Russians “have things they want in this world,” and Moscow knows ultimately the two sides will reach “a mutually acceptable arrangement if they keep talking to us,” a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said Thursday.\n\nThe final deal came together over 48 hours, senior US administration officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence. Biden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBout has returned to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nGriner’s family thanked Biden and his administration Thursday in a statement, as well as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, whose Richardson Center worked on behalf of the family to help secure Griner’s release. They also expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public support they’ve received.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers – including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the statement said.\n\n“We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\n‘We will never give up’ on Whelan, Biden says\n\nAs Griner’s return is heralded as a diplomatic achievement, officials and supporters have expressed disappointment Whelan also couldn’t come home.\n\nA US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, Whelan was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. The US State Department has declared him wrongfully detained.\n\nRussia has handled Whelan’s and Griner’s cases differently based on what each has been accused of, it has said, and signaled recently it only would negotiate over Griner, even as the Biden administration made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal.\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said Thursday. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nWhelan was happy Griner was released but “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release, he told CNN Thursday by phone from a penal colony in a remote part of Russia.\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” to try with the Russians to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday. There is a recognition the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered thus far, the official said, not ruling out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said.\n\nWhelan’s family was happy Griner was headed home but “devastated” he was left behind, they said Thursday. The Biden administration told Whelan’s family of her release ahead of the Griner announcement, Paul’s brother David Whelan told CNN.\n\nScenes from Griner’s time in Russia released\n\nGlimpses of Griner’s time in Russian custody emerged Friday via video released by RIA News Telegram.\n\nA small card bearing Griner’s photo is zip-tied to a white metal bed frame in a what appears to be a bunk room, an undated video shows. There is no location given. The bed is covered by white sheets, one with a deep blue stripe, and is among five beds seen in the room with pink walls and sheer white curtains along four windows.\n\nIn another clip, Griner wears a short haircut – without her now-famous dreadlocks – while pushing along a food line a tray bearing two dishes, apparently from among dozens of small plates and bowls seen on open serving shelves. Griner then sits next to a woman at a small square table, raising a utensil to her mouth, a still image shows.\n\nNext, in a different, bright room, Griner wears a dark headscarf while sitting across from a woman and writing with a pen on paper, the RIA News Telegram reel shows. Again in a headscarf, the US basketball star in another frame holds a phone and, after an exchange with a woman, raises her head and smiles.\n\nIn a final outdoor scene, Griner leans over a table to write on a paper while a woman wearing a hat with earflaps speaks, the video shows.\n\nGriner’s Russian lawyer said she had cut her hair while in a penal colony to make life easier during the Russian winter. Maria Blagovolina, partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan and Dyakin, told ESPN – and confirmed to CNN – Griner had cut her hair nearly two weeks ago upon arrival at the prison. Griner had told her attorneys when she washed her hair she would get cold and would get a chill, Blagovolina said.\n\nMost of the women in the penal colony worked during the day sewing uniforms, but Griner was unable to sit at a work table due to her height (she is 6-feet-9) and her hands were too large to manage the sewing. Instead, Griner carried fabric all day, her attorney said.\n\nPhoenix Mercury owner hopes players won’t ‘have to go overseas’\n\nGriner plays for the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA and is a six-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the year.\n\nFor years, she played in the offseason for a Russian women’s basketball team, until she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February.\n\nGriner testified she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage. She was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nOn Friday, Phoenix Mercury President Vince Kozar addressed the issue of whether players should continue playing in certain countries during the WNBA offseason.\n\n“The players have incredible agency with how they choose to make their livings and where they choose to play,” he said on CNN. “It’s fair to say that a lot of players, you know, have to consider their safety when they look at where they go to make their living overseas.”\n\n“My goal is for no players to have to go overseas,” he said. “My goal is for players to be able to play here in the WNBA and make their living, and that’s what we here in Phoenix and 11 markets around the country are working for.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Tina Burnside Rosalina Nieves Rosa Flores", "Travis Caldwell", "Tina Burnside", "Rosalina Nieves", "Rosa Flores"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/us/brittney-griner-departs-medical-military-facility/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner returns home to Arizona after release from Russian ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrittney Griner departed a medical military facility in Texas on Friday and returned home to Arizona, vowing in an Instagram post to play in the WNBA this season as she took another step in her reintegration into American life after her detention in Russia.\n\n“It feels so good to be home! The last 10 months have been a battle at every turn,” she wrote in her post. “I dug deep to keep my faith and it was the love from so many of you that helped keep me going. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for your help.”\n\nBrittney Griner embraces her wife, Cherelle Griner, upon her return to the US from Russia last Friday. Miguel Negron/US Army South\n\nGriner, 32, said she was “grateful to each person who advocated for me” and thanked the staff at the Texas military facility she briefly called home. She also remembered another foreign prisoner in Russia whose release could not be secured in the prisoner swap that secured her freedom.\n\n“President Biden, you brought me home and I know you are committed to bringing Paul Whelan and all Americans home too,” she said. “I will use my platform to do whatever I can to help you. I also encourage everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home. Every family deserves to be whole.”\n\nGriner plans to return to WNBA’s Mercury\n\nGriner took off from San Antonio around 11 a.m. on Friday, CNN confirmed via her agent Lindsay Kagawa Colas.\n\nAs she boarded the plane, Griner was greeted by Phoenix Mercury GM Jim Pitman, team president Vince Kozar and teammate Diana Taurasi. They made a surprise appearance to welcome her home.\n\nGriner was headed back to Arizona, though her representatives would not confirm exactly where, citing security concerns. CNN previously reported that Griner and her wife, Cherelle, had already made plans to move upon her return to the United States.\n\n“I also want to make one thing very clear: I intend to play basketball for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury this season, and in doing so, I look forward to being able to say ‘thank you’ to those of you who advocated, wrote, and posted for me in person soon,” Griner said.\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medalist was released last week in a prisoner swap after nearly 300 days in Russian custody.\n\nHer detention, after Russian officials found vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, became an international cause during a tense time in relations between Washington and Moscow. US officials deemed it a wrongful detention.\n\nShe had traveled to Russia to play basketball in the WNBA offseason and was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region on February 17.\n\nDespite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil in her luggage, Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\nA delicate diplomatic dance between US and Russia\n\nThe Mercury center became a pawn in Russia’s war in Ukraine and returned to the US on December 9 after the prisoner swap for notorious convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nFor months, a delicate diplomatic dance played out between the US and Russia, which waged war in Ukraine. The US enacted sanctions in response to the conflict while diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations.”\n\nIn a scene out of a spy thriller, the one-for-one prisoner swap occurred on a tarmac in Abu Dhabi on December 8.\n\nOnce on US soil, one of Griner’s first moves was a dunk on a Texas basketball court, according to Colas.\n\nShe donned a pair of black Chuck Taylor shoes, Phoenix Suns shorts and a T-shirt touting Title IX as she returned to the court after a long hiatus. Months ago, in pre-trial detention in Russia, Griner was offered a basketball and a hoop but declined to play, Colas said.\n\nGriner also got a haircut to clean up what family and friends jokingly called her “Russian fade.” Her long, signature dreadlocks were cut while in captivity as she continuously battled the flu because her wet hair kept freezing, according to Colas.\n\nA bittersweet return\n\nStill, her return has been somewhat bittersweet. Griner is heartbroken that Whelan is still detained, her agent said.\n\nWhelan is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen who is imprisoned in a Russian penal colony after he was arrested in December 2018 on espionage charges, which he has denied. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nLike Griner, Whelan has been declared wrongfully detained by US officials.\n\nGriner is eager to use her power and influence to help others, especially Whelan, according to her agent.\n\n“She is thinking about his family and talked about her intention to call them as soon as she gets home,” Colas told CNN. “She’s really committed to telling this story and making sure that this population of wrongfully detained Americans, that people know their names.”\n\nGriner stayed at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio for a week for routine evaluation. She stayed with her wife in a residential facility on the base. A Christmas tree decorated their living space.\n\n“I appreciate the time and care to make sure I was okay and equipped with the tools for this new journey,” she wrote on Instagram, referring to staff at the San Antonio base.\n\nHer arrest and conviction brought attention to the plight of other Americans in Russian custody, including Whelan and Trevor Reed.\n\nWhelan’s release could not be secured in the latest prisoner swap, while Reed returned to the US in April after a nearly three-year ordeal.\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\nIn multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nHer flight to Arizona Friday is just one more step in her reintegration.\n\nShe opted into the Department of Defense’s post-isolation program, which other wrongfully detained Americans, including Reed, have participated in, according to Colas. The program focuses on helping formerly captive people regain a sense of control over their lives after lengthy detentions.", "authors": ["Abphillip Ray Sanchez", "Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}]}

Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nPopularity causes tensions with other royals\n\nThe couple said their popularity with the public caused issues within the royal household, with their tour in Australia being described in the documentary as a turning point.\n\nHarry said Meghan’s popularity in particular caused problems at the palace, recalling similarities with his mother Diana, who married into the royal family and was beloved by the public.\n\n“The issue is when someone who’s marrying in, who should be a supporting act is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than the person who is born to do this. That upsets people. It shifts the balance,” Harry said.\n\nThe couple recalled how media coverage started to turn negative, with Meghan increasingly associated with racist tropes such as drugs, criminality or terrorism.\n\nHarry and Meghan pictured during their tour of Australia in October 2018. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nMeghan contemplated suicide\n\nDoria Ragland, Meghan’s mother, recounted how her daughter told her she had thought about taking her own life after being constantly “picked at by these vultures” in the media.\n\n“That she would actually think of not wanting to be here … That’s not an easy one for a mom to hear,” said Ragland.\n\nHarry said he “never thought that it would get to that stage,” and the fact it did left him feeling “angry and ashamed.”\n\nMeghan said she wanted to get help but was prevented from doing so amid concerns that it could affect the image of the institution.\n\nThe duchess later discussed her struggles in an official royal documentary, thanking a journalist who asked her how she’d been feeling. “Not many people have asked if I’m OK,” she said.\n\nMore controversy around Archie’s birth\n\nThe couple recalled how their desire to keep some privacy around the birth of their first child caused a significant backlash.\n\n“The amount of abuse we got … for not wanting to serve our child up on a silver platter was incredible,” said Harry.\n\nA narrative developed that the couple were being selfish for not doing a traditional photo call shortly after the birth of a royal baby, and Harry remembers seeing a post on social media of a couple walking either side of a chimpanzee alongside the caption: “Royal baby leaves hospital.”\n\nMeghan ‘fed to the wolves’\n\nThe duchess said she did everything she could to make the royal family “proud,” but at one point “the bubble burst” and there was a flood of negative media coverage.\n\n“I realized that I wasn’t just being thrown to the wolves, I was being fed to the wolves,” she said.\n\nHarry said he believes that the press understood that the palace wasn’t going to protect Meghan, and once that happens “the floodgates open.”\n\nDuchess received death threats\n\nThe documentary touches on how a hate campaign against the couple built on social media, with the primary focus on Meghan.\n\n“The seriousness of what has happened to her and what … happened to us, and what continues to happen to her, that needs to be acknowledged,” said Harry.\n\nMeghan recalls how the family’s security team has a protocol for when a tweet such as “Meghan just needs to die” is spotted online.\n\n“That’s, like, what’s actually out in the world because of people creating hate. And I’m a mom,” she said. “That’s my real life.”\n\n“And that’s the piece when you see it and you go, ‘You are making people want to kill me,’” added the duchess. “It’s not just a tabloid. It’s not just some story. You are making me scared. Right?”\n\n‘Terrifying’ row at Sandringham\n\nHarry recalled how he traveled to the royal residence Sandringham for a meeting to discuss the couple’s future role in the family.\n\n“It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me and my father say things that simply weren’t true, and my grandmother quietly sit there and sort of take it all in,” said Harry.\n\nAnd the relationship between the two brothers continued to worsen.\n\n“The saddest part of it was this wedge created between myself and my brother so that he’s now on the institution side,” said Harry.\n\nHarry spoke about a joint statement issued in January 2020, in which the brothers denied a newspaper story alleging that a rift in the royal family was caused by William’s “bullying attitude.”\n\nIn this Netflix episode, Harry claims he was not aware of the statement. “No one had asked me permission to put my name to a statement like that,” he said.\n\n“They were happy to lie to protect my brother and yet for three years they were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,” he added.\n\nMedia coverage blamed for miscarriage\n\nHarry blamed the media for placing undue stress on his wife.\n\nMeghan recounted how she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020 after moving to Santa Barbara, California, recalling how she was stressed about how UK newspaper the Mail on Sunday had published a private letter to her father, Thomas Markle.\n\n“I was pregnant. I really wasn’t sleeping. The first morning that we woke up in our new home is when I miscarried,” said Meghan.\n\n“I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what the Mail did,” Harry added. “I watched the whole thing.”\n\n“Now, do we absolutely know the miscarriage was created, caused by that? Course we don’t. But bearing in mind the stress that that caused, the lack of sleep, and the timing of the pregnancy, how many weeks in she was, I can say, from what I saw, that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her,” he added.\n\nCNN has contacted the Mail on Sunday and its publisher Associated Newspapers Limited for comment.\n\nHollywood move meant six weeks without press coverage\n\nHarry said it took reporters six weeks to find out that the couple had moved into director and screenwriter Tyler Perry’s home in Hollywood, before eventually publishing the location of their new home.\n\nHe also recalled measures taken to prevent paparazzi from snapping photos of the couple.\n\n“These large poles are basically the construction of a fence to stop paparazzi from taking photographs from three, four hundred meters away,” said Harry. “And as ridiculous and as absurd as this is, you kind of have to laugh about it, because it is madness.”\n\nPerry then claims the fence around the property would be cut, people would sneak in and there were “helicopters 24/7.”\n\n‘No accountability’\n\nHarry talks about going home for his grandfather Prince Philip’s funeral in April 2021.\n\nWhile Harry says that neither he nor the rest of the family wanted to talk about the situation around Harry and Meghan that day, he did discuss it with his father and brother. He said Prince William and King Charles were “focused on the same misinterpretation of the whole situation.”\n\n“I’ve had to make peace with the fact that we’re probably never going to get genuine accountability or a genuine apology,” said Harry.\n\nCalifornia is now ‘home’\n\nHarry reminds viewers that Archie spent only the first five months of his life in the UK before the family relocated to California, and daughter Lilibet was born in the US.\n\n“This is home to him, this is home to Lili, and this is our home,” said Harry, who added that life is very different for the family in the US. “I get to do things with our kids that I would never be able to do in the UK.”", "authors": ["Jack Guy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/entertainment/harry-meghan-netflix-miscarriage-scli-intl/index.html", "title": "Harry blames media coverage for Meghan's miscarriage | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nPrince Harry has blamed the media for placing undue stress on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, leading to her having a miscarriage and suffering suicidal thoughts.\n\nHe made the comments in the final episodes of the six-part Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary, which aired on Thursday.\n\nThe fourth, fifth and sixth episodes of “Harry & Meghan” cover the pair’s challenges since their 2018 wedding, Meghan’s deteriorating mental health and her 2020 miscarriage, and ultimately their decision to quit as working members of the family.\n\nIn the sixth episode, Meghan discusses her widely publicized miscarriage in July 2020.

And her ultimate mission and goal, responsibility, is the institution … she’s going to go on the advice that she’s given,” Harry said.\n\nThe pair describe throughout the new episodes how, in their view, their position within the royal family became untenable after constant hounding from Britain’s media and repeated disregard for the couple’s wellbeing inside palace walls.\n\nBuckingham Palace reiterated it will not comment on the documentary on Thursday. Royal engagements are meanwhile continuing, with King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, set to visit a community kitchen in London and attend a carol service with the Prince and Princess of Wales and other members of the family.\n\nHarry hinted that there was jealousy from other royals towards Meghan given the amount of media attention she was initially receiving. “The issue is when someone who is marrying in, who should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than the person who is born to do this,” he said.\n\n“That upsets people. It upsets the balance. Because you have been led to believe that the only way that your charities can succeed and your mission can grow is if you are on the front pages of those newspapers.”\n\nThe series also touches on Meghan’s deteriorating mental health and her miscarriage in July 2020. “I was pregnant. I really wasn’t sleeping. The first morning that we woke up in our new home is when I miscarried,” Meghan said.\n\nShe described experiencing suicidal ideation, telling the filmmakers she believed “all of this will stop if I’m not here. And that was the scariest thing about it, it was such clear thinking.”\n\n“The lies, that’s one thing. You kind of get used to that when you live within this family,” Harry added. “But what they were doing to her, and the effect it was having on her… enough. Enough of the pain, enough of the suffering.”\n\n“I just did everything I could to make them proud, and to really be a part of the family,” Meghan said in the fifth episode, speaking of her relationship with the other royals. “And then the bubble burst.”\n\n“I realized that I wasn’t just being thrown to the wolves, I was being fed to the wolves,” she said.\n\nThe couple described the breakdown in their relationship with the royal institution. Courtesy of Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\n\nA family and business ‘in direct conflict’\n\nThe highly anticipated Netflix documentary marks the Sussexes’ latest attempt to reclaim the narrative surrounding their departure from royal life.\n\nIt features details on the increasingly tense relationships between Harry and his brother, WIlliam, and his father, King Charles III. And it emphasizes the suggestion that the royals wanted to sideline and isolate the couple, often through the planting of negative media reporting, rather than have them dwarf more senior royals in popularity.\n\n“My dad said to me: ‘Darling boy, you can’t take on the media. The media will always be the media,” Harry said, describing the palace’s relationship with news outlets as a “dirty game.”\n\nThe culmination of the breakdown between the royal institution and Harry and Meghan, who were once touted by parts of the media as the modernizing force the monarchy needed, was their historic and controversial decision in early 2020 to quit as working royals and leave the UK.\n\nHarry said he spoke to Queen Elizabeth II and arranged to meet her, with Meghan, before that split was finalized.\n\n“She knew that we were finding things hard. I’d spoken to her many times about it,” Harry said. But as the meeting approached, Meghan said they received a message from an aide telling them they were not allowed to see the monarch.\n\n“I’ve actually been told that I’m busy all week,” the Queen then told Harry, according to his recollection. “I was like, wow,” Harry said. “This is when a family and a family business are in direct conflict … really what they’re doing is blocking a grandson from seeing his grandmother,” added Meghan.\n\nThe couple were critical of the Queen’s aides but again were again complimentary of the late monarch herself, who died aged 96 in September, shortly after filming concluded for the series.\n\nTheir documentary, and Harry’s upcoming memoir, focus more attention on the difficult relationship between the prince and his father, King Charles.\n\nThursday’s release follows last week’s batch of episodes, in which Prince Harry criticized “unconscious bias” inside the family.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the venture will enhance the reputation of the couple as they look to sculpt their post-royalty personas.\n\nSix in 10 Brits believe it was a bad idea for the duke and duchess to release the Netflix documentary, according to a Savanta poll of 2,250 British adults carried out online between December 9 and 11, between the release of the first and second parts of the series.\n\nThe same poll found that Harry and Meghan both have negative approval ratings among the British public – -3 and -19 respectively, when subtracting those with a negative opinion from those with a positive one – unlike the high popularity of Prince William (+60) and Charles III (+36).\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to connect with a trained counselor or visit the NSPL site.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nLet’s just stipulate that racism probably played a role in the scurrilous press coverage and barely-disguised slights – including from some within the royal family – that Meghan Markle has been subjected to in Britain.\n\nAndrew Sample Photography\n\nEven one of the organizations governing media in the United Kingdom conceded last year that “there is a lot of work to be done” when covering issues related to race. That statement was issued amid an outcry from journalists of color over the unflattering coverage that Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, received in the aftermath of their famous sit down with Oprah Winfrey. The current firestorm over their new Netflix docuseries suggests to me that the media’s work in confronting this bias remains unfinished.\n\nBut the decidedly chilly reception that the Duchess of Sussex received as a “mixed-race” American divorcee – one of the major through lines of the six-part series in which she and Harry bare their souls – wasn’t really the main point of the project.\n\nUltimately, this series is about freeing oneself from family dysfunction, healing and moving forward.\n\nHarry and Meghan’s Netflix documentary series debuted last week with three initial installments. The last three episodes, which debuted this week, offered a powerful reminder that sometimes the best thing we can do is walk away from our family members in hopelessly toxic situations, even though we still love them. Sometimes you have to choose yourself over those relatives, even if they are part of a powerful and exalted institution.\n\nIt’s a vivid lesson in how to look after oneself when the people around you not only don’t seem to care if you survive, but also seem to be secretly, actively making sure you don’t thrive. And it provides an in-depth window into surviving familial conflict, navigating outsize personalities and cavernous gulfs dividing close relatives. That can be especially hard when you’re struggling to maintain your sense of autonomy and your own integrity while trapped in a system that affords you very little of either.\n\nAt least, that’s the plot line that resonates most for me, because I have lived aspects of their story, although on a much more modest scale. In fact, my guess is that many of the millions of people who have watched the series can relate. We’ve had to learn over the years that no matter how much you may want to heal broken relationships, you have to know ultimately when to walk away and how to take care of yourself.\n\nI “get” Harry and Meghan. I’ve experienced some of the very same lessons in my own sometimes tumultuous, dysfunctional family, which is why I wrote my latest book, “Be the One You Need: 21 Life Lessons I Learned Taking Care of Everyone but Me.” What I find fascinating is how clueless many people seem to be about family estrangement and break-ups, rife as they are in these modern times.\n\nThe Sussexes both experienced unhappiness in childhood because of divorce. Meghan describes a lonely childhood shuttling between her mother’s home in California and her dad’s.\n\nHarry’s story is not just sad, but tragic: The second son born to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, he marched solemnly behind her coffin, showing Britain that even as a 12-year old, he was already a perfect, stoic member of the royal family. That’s a lot to ask of any child.\n\nI’m surprised at how shocked some people seem to be that as members of a millennial generation famous for sharing and sometimes oversharing, Meghan and Harry did not hold back when it came to airing their dirty laundry about the dysfunction within the royal fold.\n\nTheirs is a generation that does not want to be hamstrung by the strictures of tradition, even if it comes adorned with a tiara and conveyed in a golden carriage. When millennials spill the tea, they do so publicly – in videos and on social media.\n\nNow these most famous members of their generation have bared their souls in Netflix’s most-viewed documentary in the first week of its debut. And in the parlance of today – language not apparently familiar to their royal betters – the Sussexes are speaking their truth.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Harry’s grandmother Elizabeth II, beloved as she was, Britain’s royal family was never known for being open and forthcoming. By contrast, Meghan, very much a child of her generation, explains in the the documentary that “a big part of life is connecting and communicating.” A culture clash if ever there was one.\n\nShe was remarking on an interview a few years back in which a reporter had simply asked her, “Are you OK?” Her response, as tears welled in her eyes, made world headlines: “Thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I’m OK.”\n\nThose comments went viral, because they gave us insights into the toll of being a new Duchess. They were also eerily reminiscent of remarks made by a young Princess Diana, who in a now infamous BBC interview described how she too had been hung out to dry in a family that does not always warmly welcome outsiders who marry into their ranks.\n\nWe’ve all read the headlines about how Meghan recounted even considering taking her own life as she unsuccessfully tried to navigate what Harry called a “drip feed of constant attack.” He also described what he called “institutional gaslighting” that he and his wife endured. And in one of the most quoted lines from the Netflix series, Meghan described feeling that she had been not just “thrown to the wolves – I was being fed to the wolves.” Buckingham Palace has declined to respond to the allegations made in the series.\n\nAt various points in the documentary series, Harry describes ways in which Meghan reminds him of his mother, a woman known for being open, caring and empathic. He seems to suggest that in casting his lot with Diana and Meghan, he understands that he has sealed his fate as an outsider to his royal kin.\n\nWhat Harry and Meghan are doing is telling their own story, not repeating the royal family talking points as they were required to do while living within its purview. Yes, they are “outing” the royals for their flaws and failings, its secret machinations and disingenuousness.\n\nHarry is also exposing the monarchy’s longstanding tradition of courting the media and blaming it at the same time. But he is also saying, in so many words: History will not repeat itself. I will protect my wife, my children and my own emotional and mental wellbeing – even if it means breaking with the only family I have ever known.\n\nOne irony raised by various subjects during the series, is that the royals had a golden opportunity to truly embrace and protect both Harry and Meghan – and use their unique love story, their star power and their readiness to confront outdated traditions to modernize the 1,000-year-old institution.\n\nMeghan might have been the very addition to the family who could have helped build a bridge to the next generation of Britons – and to the overwhelmingly Black and brown inhabitants of Britain’s Commonwealth nations. It’s an opportunity that has been squandered.\n\nAnd here’s another unpleasant truth that the series makes plain – one that will be hard for some to stomach: The British royal family seems unlikely to survive as an institution in its current form. Its survival is in doubt because – as we saw confirmed in this documentary – it is dusty, creaky and out-of-step with the times. It can also be cruel, unkind, and hopelessly unwilling to adapt or embrace the new views about human connection and diversity that is the source of vitality in many countries around the world.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

Even the young royals, Kate and William, received a chilly reception in majority-Black Jamaica this year, as the island contemplates exiting the Commonwealth. It also showed William’s father King Charles III – at the time still Prince of Wales – sitting stony-faced in Barbados, as that Caribbean island ended its membership in the body.\n\nIn short, Harry and Meghan are not villains, nor are they trying to tear down the royal family. In the language of today, they are speaking their truth, as unpleasant as it might be, judging from the reaction of some critics.\n\nLooking for freedom from his family’s longstanding and very public dysfunction, Harry has found it with his American wife Meghan and their two children.

We know the full truth, the institution knows the full truth, and the media knows the full truth because they’ve been in on it,” Harry said. He said he considers it his “duty” to “uncover this exploitation and bribery that happens within our media.”\n\nA still from the documentary shows Meghan in tears. From Netflix\n\nThe series comes over a year and a half after the couple’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which contained a flurry of criticisms of members of the royal family and caused turmoil at the palace.\n\nIt marks a first major public relations test for the monarchy under King Charles III, who himself has been tacitly criticized by Harry since their split from the family, and whose relationship with his son has frayed.\n\n‘Skeletons’ in the royals’ closet\n\n“I accept that there will be people around the world who fundamentally disagree with what I’ve done and how I’ve done it,” Prince Harry said of the watershed decision to leave the royal family in early 2020, which set the stage for years of revelations from the couple and turned their relationships with Harry’s relatives frosty.\n\n“But I knew that I had to do everything I could to protect my family, especially after what happened to my mum,” Harry continued.\n\nThe couple have spoken before about the constraints placed on them while members of the royal family, and that frustration re-emerged repeatedly in the documentary.\n\nMeghan described her engagement announcement in 2017 as an “orchestrated reality show,” calling their first interview as an engaged couple “rehearsed.” And speaking of the media’s initial fascination with the prince’s then-girlfriend, Harry recalled how other members of the royal family struggled to share his concern.\n\n“As far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything that she was being put through, they had been put through as well. So it was almost like a rite of passage,” Harry said. “My wife had to go through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?,” he said, paraphrasing their arguments.\n\n“I said the difference here is the race element,” Harry added. The pair have frequently railed against racist undertones in tabloid coverage of Meghan, who is biracial.\n\n“These are the skeletons in the closet that frequently make an unwelcome appearance in daily life in this family – sometimes, you know, you’re part of the problem rather than part of the solution and there is a huge level of unconscious bias,” Harry said.\n\n“The thing with unconscious bias – it is actually no one’s fault. But once it has been pointed out, or identified within yourself, you then need to make it right,” he said.\n\nElsewhere in the first batch of episodes, Harry commented on some previous marriages among his relatives and ancestors. “I think for so many people in the family, especially the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with,” he said.\n\nAnd the pair recall Meghan’s first meetings with the Queen, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and other senior royals.\n\n“I remember my family first meeting her and being incredibly impressed. Some of them didn’t quite know what to do with themselves,” Harry said.\n\n“They were surprised … the fact that I was dating an American actress was probably what clouded their judgement more than anything else at the beginning,” he added. “The actress thing was the biggest problem, funnily enough,” Meghan added.\n\nMeghan is ‘so similar’ to Diana\n\nThroughout the first three episodes of the series, the couple spoke of their frustration at the hands of the notoriously boisterous British media.\n\n“My face was everywhere, my life was everywhere, tabloids had taken over everything,” Meghan said of her early encounters with the press.\n\nHarry also compared Meghan to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a car crash while being chased by paparazzi in 1997. “So much of what Meghan is and how she is is so similar to my mum … She has the same confidence, she has this warmth about her,” he said in the first episode.\n\nThe first three episodes were released on Thursday, with three more scheduled for next week. Interviews were completed in August, the month before the Queen’s death, according to the series.\n\nIts release follows a period of seemingly thawing relations between Harry and his family following the death of the Queen in September. Harry and William re-united for a walkabout and other public appearances in the period of mourning that followed, and King Charles III used his first speech as monarch to “express (his) love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas.”\n\nBut new tensions could arise when the second part of the documentary airs next week, which is expected to detail their split from the family and move to the US. Harry’s memoir, titled “Spare,” is meanwhile due to be released in January.\n\nBuckingham Palace said on Thursday that it will not be commenting on the documentary.\n\nA royal source initially CNN that neither Buckingham Palace nor Kensington Palace, nor any members of the royal family, were approached for comment on the content of the series. The Netflix documentary noted within the series that members of the British royal family “declined to comment on the content.”\n\nCNN understands that Kensington Palace did receive an email purporting to be from a third-party production company, via a different, unknown organization’s email address, seeking comment on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s new docu-series that was released on Netflix on Thursday.\n\nThe palace contacted Archewell Productions and Netflix to attempt to verify the authenticity of the email but received no response, CNN understands.

But a lucky group of Texas State University students will get to parse the particulars of the British pop star for a grade.\n\nLouie Dean Valencia, associate professor of digital history at Texas State, announced last week that he’ll helm a spring 2023 class entitled “Harry Styles and the Cult of Celebrity: Identity, the Internet and European Pop Culture.” Styles’ legion of fans quickly took notice, prompting many to contemplate transferring to Texas.\n\nBut this sojourn through Styles’ career is no fluff-filled blow-off class. The course centers the ever-popular Brit in a wider discussion on the “cultural and political development of the modern celebrity as related to questions of gender and sexuality, race, class, nation and globalism, media, fashion, fan culture, internet culture and consumerism,” according to a flier for the class Valencia shared.\n\nPhew. That’s complex stuff for the man who once wholeheartedly serenaded a love interest by telling her she didn’t know she was beautiful. But as Styles’ musical gifts have evolved, so has his place in the cultural lexicon, Valencia told CNN in an email.\n\n“I can’t tell you how many conversations I’ve had with students over the last two years that started with a shared love of Harry’s music, but that quickly went into larger societal questions about gender, sexuality, race, gun control, sustainability because of Harry’s art,” he said.\n\nMaterials for the class will span One Direction’s early albums to Styles’ solo outings and his growing filmography, Valencia said, as well as the art that inspired Styles, from the writing of Susan Sontag to the philosophy of Alain de Botton, among other subjects.\n\nValencia, who’s been a fan of Styles since his One Direction days, said that Styles, like The Beatles, Billie Holiday and even Shakespeare, provides a lens through which students can better understand their world. Styles’ major tenets are positivity and self-love, he said.\n\n“Self-expression, and comfort with oneself, is a big part of Harry’s message – along with treating people with kindness,” Valencia said. “A lot of people, myself included, feel like they’ve grown up with him – and so there is a connection.”\n\nHe said he hopes that students who take this course, one that invites them to consider history as they’re living through it with one of the world’s biggest musical superstars, will inspire the same self-acceptance and unbridled joy that a Styles concert does.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/harry-meghan-netflix-docuseries/index.html", "title": "'Harry & Meghan' docuseries trailer debuts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet ready for a more intimate look into the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nNetflix has released the first official trailer for the couple’s forthcoming docuseries, “Harry & Meghan.”\n\n“Why did you want to make this documentary?” they’re asked in the trailer, followed by a series of photos of the couple in both public and private moments.\n\n“No one sees what’s happening behind closed doors,” Prince Harry is heard saying. “I had to do everything I could to protect my family.”\n\nMeghan is later shown saying, “When the stakes are this high doesn’t it make more sense to hear our story from us?”\n\nNetflix refers to it as “an unprecedented and in-depth documentary series.”\n\nHarry & Meghan | Official Teaser | Netflix\n\n“Across six episodes, the series explores the clandestine days of their early courtship and the challenges that led to them feeling forced to step back from their full-time roles in the institution,”a press release for the series states. “With commentary from friends and family, most of whom have never spoken publicly before about what they witnessed, and historians who discuss the state of the British Commonwealth today and the royal family’s relationship with the press, the series does more than illuminate one couple’s love story, it paints a picture of our world and how we treat each other.”\n\nNo release date has been announced but the project is “coming soon,” according to Netflix.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside William and Harry's rollercoaster relationship 01:51 - Source: CNN\n\nSign up for CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/03/entertainment/harry-styles-copenhagen/index.html", "title": "Harry Styles cancels Copenhagen show after shooting near venue ...", "text": "1.

Doug Lamborn of Colorado misused official resources and Democratic Rep. Marie Newman of Illinois promised federal employment to a primary opponent to get political support.\n\nBoth Newman and Lamborn have denied the allegations, each alleging that the complaints were political in nature.\n\nA spokesman for Newman stated that a “right-wing organization filed a politically-motivated complaint” with the Office of Congressional Ethics, adding, “The materials produced during the OCE’s review overwhelmingly demonstrate that the ethics complaint is completely meritless.”\n\nLamborn’s spokeswoman, Cassandra Sebastian, said the congressman will cooperate with the House Ethics Committee and that he “expects to be fully exonerated.”\n\n“It is extremely disappointing that two disgruntled former staffers have weaponized the ethics process for political and personal purposes,” she said.\n\nMarie Newman\n\nThe board of the Office of Congressional Ethics unanimously voted to recommend further review of allegations that Newman “may have promised federal employment to a primary opponent for the purpose of procuring political support,” and determined that “there is substantial reason to believe” that this may have occurred.\n\nDue to redistricting, Newman will likely face off against her Democratic colleague Rep. Sean Casten in 2022.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics report alleges Newman promised her campaign’s foreign policy adviser Iymen Chehade a job in her congressional office, and both parties signed a contract acknowledging this. Chehade sued to enforce the contract after the job did not materialize, “claiming that he decided not to run for the 2020 congressional seat in reliance of her promise to hire him as a foreign policy advisor and either District Director or Legislative Director in her congressional office.”\n\nNewman and Chehade settled the case, but during the legal proceedings the congresswoman acknowledged that any contract promising him such a job violates House employment and federal contracting rules, the report states.\n\nChehade has not cooperated with the board’s investigation, and it has recommended that the committee subpoena him.\n\nDoug Lamborn\n\nThe committee is extending its review on Lamborn after the board voted unanimously on a report that it has “substantial reason to believe” that Lamborn misused official resources for personal and non-official purposes.\n\nFive witnesses, comprised of current and former Lamborn staffers, testified that at various points and in different instances they were instructed to perform a host of activities including running personal errands, performing campaign work, picking up mail, moving furniture, scheduling Zoom calls, putting together a naturalization celebration for Lamborn’s daughter-in-law and in one case helping Lamborn’s son with a federal job application process.\n\n“The OCE uncovered evidence showing a pattern and practice in Rep. Lamborn’s office of official staff conducting personal and campaign-related tasks for Rep. Lamborn, his wife, and other family members during official work hours, and using official resources,” the report from the committee reads.\n\nWhile Lamborn sat for an initial interview and provided preliminary documents to the committee, the committee stated that Lamborn refused to provide additional office daily reports, which is where staffers documented their unofficial errands. Therefore, the committee said that Lamborn “did not cooperate with this review.”\n\nThe committee also revealed that the congressman’s chief of staff, Dale Anderson, did not cooperate with its investigation.\n\nThe board recommended that the next step is for the committee to issue subpoenas to Lamborn, Anderson, Peter Holland, Margaret Thrailkill and Wesley Harkins.\n\nThe report describes the role Lamborn’s wife plays in the office as “exceeded what is permissible for spouses.” She has an official email account, but went beyond normal protocol, and according to testimony “regularly” requested staff help with campaign-related matters or personal errands during the workday. Staffers also testified that she was involved in the hiring, firing and promotion decision-making process.\n\nFor example, Witness 1, a former district director, recalled that Anderson said of Mrs. Lamborn asking for assistance during the workday, “If anybody asked, it was – we took it on our own lunch but it would last like two or three hours.”\n\nA former staffer explained that Anderson made it clear that “Mrs. Lamborn had precedence and that, if – no matter – there were certain things that we were doing that were – we needed all hands helping, and she would always overrule those situations.”\n\nThe former staffer added that after Anderson would explain that “then Mrs. Lamborn would say, if mama ain’t happy, nobody’s happy.”\n\nRep. Lamborn was asked specifically about whether his wife instructed a congressional staffer to move furniture at his home during personal time and Lamborn recalled this happening “on at least one or maybe per – perhaps two occasions.”\n\nWhen asked whether his wife has asked staffers for assistance with personal errands, the congressman told the committee, “My – my understanding is that my wife would not do that because that’s not really allowed under the congressional rules of – of ethics and she wouldn’t want to run afoul of that. You know, we try to follow the rules very carefully and very sincerely. So I don’t think she would knowingly do that. I just don’t think she would knowingly do that,” according to the report.\n\nIn 2020, when Lamborn’s daughter-in-law became a naturalized citizen, the Lamborns and Anderson instructed staff to plan and host a celebration in Lamborn’s district office, the report states.\n\n“The day of, I was like, how am I going to get compensated for this? And, again, Dale Anderson just laughed,” Witness 1 said.\n\nIn 2020, Witness 5 testified that Anderson instructed him to assist Lamborn’s son with his job application process before the son was ultimately hired at the Pentagon. Witness 5 stated that he spent “several hours providing extensive guidance,” which included reviewing his resume, evaluating federal job postings and assisting with mock interview questions. Witness 5 even recalled helping Lamborn’s son with interview preparations over a weekend.\n\nThe investigation also found that staffers said they were instructed to host celebrations in the office for special occasions such as Christmas and birthdays, which included a gift from all staffers in both the district and DC office.\n\nWitness 5 testified that he would receive an email from Anderson before the holidays or the congressman’s birthday instructing him to provide a gift and that he did not interpret it as a voluntary request. Witness 1 stated that Anderson told each office to provide a gift valued between $125 and $200 and that gifts related to beer and food were preferable.\n\nAlthough current and former staffers testified that there might have been glitter and balloons or cake and ice cream for staff, the committee found that staffers did not receive gifts “with the same frequency or of equal or similar value to that of the Lamborns.”\n\nThe committee did acknowledge in its report that there were “some inconsistencies” among the witnesses and how they each described the pervasiveness of the issue.", "authors": ["Morgan Rimmer Annie Grayer", "Morgan Rimmer", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/09/13/ron-desantis-resignation-house-ends-ethics-issue-donors/1290779002/", "title": "DeSantis resignation ends dormant ethics complaint that raised ...", "text": "TALLAHASSEE – When Republican Ron DeSantis resigned from Congress this week, his departure shut down an ethics complaint that had not advanced to the level of an investigation since it was filed five months ago.\n\nThe complaint, which alleged DeSantis rented out a Palm Coast beachfront condo at a \"well below fair market value,\" did not advance to the U.S. House Committee on Ethics, which reviews claims against congressional members if warranted.\n\nBut it raised questions about the three-term congressman's close ties to two campaign donors, who work as top executives at Total Military Management, a Jacksonville-based defense contractor that has spent more than $700,000 since 2012 lobbying the federal government.\n\nAllies of DeSantis argue the complaint was a political stunt against the former congressman, who is now running against Democrat Andrew Gillum, a candidate who continues to face questions about trips with a lobbyist to Costa Rica and New York.\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, was slapped with an ethics complaint last year because of those travel arrangements that could also be tied to an ongoing FBI investigation into the city.\n\nWhile Gillum has not been directly implicated in the federal investigation, DeSantis’ political team often tries to highlight his connections to it.\n\n“When it comes to Andrew Gillum’s Tallahassee dealings, his dizzying web of deception is quickly entangling his bid for governor,” DeSantis’ camp said in a written statement this month.\n\nThe DeSantis living arrangement, first reported by Politico Florida, that led to the ethics complaint filed against him was for a five-month period in 2016 when he was running for re-election.\n\nThe courts had recently approved new district maps that drew DeSantis' house in St. Johns County out of his congressional district. That prompted DeSantis to rent the beachfront Palm Coast condo from Kent Stermon and Matt Connell while he looked for a house in Flagler County in his congressional district.\n\nDeSantis paid $2,000 a month to stay there. But Miami lawyer Richard Ruben, who filed a complaint against DeSantis with the U.S. House Office of Congressional Ethics, said he was “troubled that Rep. DeSantis was potentially gifted, by a close campaign contributor and lobbyists, a condominium to reside in.”\n\nRuben declined to comment this week and hung up the phone when contacted for an interview.\n\nMore:Andrew Gillum leads Ron DeSantis for Florida governor, says Chamber of Commerce poll\n\nU.S. House rules state members are not allowed to knowingly accept gifts, a term broadly defined as a “favor, discount, hospitality … or any other item having monetary value.”\n\nThe rent paid by DeSantis, however, is in line with market value estimates of $2,000 a month for the condo, according to Zillow.com, which tracks real estate sales and rental data.\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics forwards complaints to the Committee on Ethics if the claims warrant review.\n\n“He was never notified about any investigation” by either the Office of Congressional Ethics or the Committee of Ethics, campaign spokesman Stephen Lawson said.\n\nWith DeSantis out of Congress, those entities have now lost jurisdiction over the complaint.\n\nAs the FBI investigation clouds Gillum’s candidacy, DeSantis’ ethics complaint has barely impacted his race, even though Stermon and Connell continue to keep their close ties to DeSantis.\n\nSince February, both have given a total of $19,000 to the gubernatorial candidate's campaign and political action committee.\n\nSince DeSantis' first House race in 2012, Stermon and Connell each have given $10,500 in political contributions to him. The defense company’s political action committee, which cites Stermon as the treasurer, also contributed more than $18,000 to DeSantis in the six-year period, according to federal campaign finance records.\n\nMore:Ron DeSantis resigns from Congress to focus on Florida's gubernatorial campaign\n\nLobbying disclosure forms also show the defense company spent more than $700,000 to lobby the federal government on Department of Defense issues since 2012.

The purchase was finalized about a week before the November 2016 election, which DeSantis won.\n\nIn May 2018, DeSantis and his wife, Casey, sold it to former GOP Kansas U.S. Rep. Marc Rhoades and his wife, Denise.\n\nMonths before the house was sold, in December 2017, DeSantis moved back to his house in St. Johns County, and out of his congressional district.\n\nWhile the U.S. Constitution does not require members of Congress to live in their districts, they often are criticized if they do not.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/politics/madison-cawthorn-house-ethics-investigation/index.html", "title": "House Ethics Committee launches investigation into Madison ...", "text": "1.

John Rutherford over multiple late disclosures of stock transactions, a matter that Rutherford said he believed he'd already put behind him by paying fines.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee's leaders announced Tuesday they would open the investigation after receiving a referral from the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nRutherford, R-Jacksonville, serves on the bipartisan, 10-member House Committee on Ethics, so the committee is reviewing one of its own members.\n\nThe committee on Tuesday released a February report by the Office of Congressional Ethics that said Rutherford did not cooperate because he would not sit down to answer questions.\n\nRutherford's attorney disputed that finding, saying in a March letter to the ethics committee that Rutherford had provided all documents sought by the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nThe investigation centers on the STOCK Act that requires members of Congress to disclose stock transactions in excess of $1,000. The law is aimed at cracking down on lawmakers using nonpublic information gained from their positions in order to benefit financially from their investments.\n\nRutherford said Friday after taking part in a groundbreaking ceremony in Jacksonville that he had paid fines for seven overdue reports.\n\n\"Everything is done as far as I know,\" he said. \"I paid the fine that they asked for, and I'm done with it.\"\n\nThe STOCK Act requires members of Congress to report any transaction of more than $1,000 no later than 45 days. The frequency of the reporting is crucial to the effectiveness of making such information public, according to the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nEach overdue report of a transaction can trigger a $200 fine.\n\nRutherford said the stock trades were handled by the manager of his IRA account for his retirement fund, so he didn't think that falls under the reporting requirements of the STOCK Act.\n\n\"My contention is my IRA never fit that category because I don't have direct authority,\" Rutherford said. \"I've got a manager somewhere. I don't even know who it is who makes those purchases of stock. I'm not involved with that.\"\n\nHe said the argument for him falling under the STOCK Act is that he gets investment reports identifying what stock he owns.\n\n\"So I said, OK, I'm going to move all of mine into a mutual fund,\" he said, referring to the type of investment that bundles many stocks into a single fund.\n\nRaytheon stock purchased same day Russia invaded Ukraine\n\nRutherford's financial disclosure reports show a purchase of Raytheon Technologies Corp. stock on Feb. 24, the same day Russia invaded Ukraine. Raytheon, a major defense contractor, manufactures the shoulder-fired Stinger missiles that Ukraine has used to defend itself from Russia's attacks by air.\n\nRutherford said the decision to purchase Raytheon stock was made by the IRA fund manager. The financial disclosure puts the value of the Raytheon transaction at between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nThe invasion had been expected for weeks, as the White House held regular news briefings. President Biden predicted the invasion in January after Russia amassed troops on the border.\n\nRutherford urged holding Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable. \"The U.S. and our allies must impose the maximum possible sanctions & leave nothing off the table,\" he said in a tweet the same day as the invasion.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee's investigation does not make any reference to the purchase of the Raytheon stock.\n\nInvestigation spans reports of stock trades back to 2018\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics, which referred the mattered to the committee in February, concluded in its report there is \"substantial reason to believe\" Rutherford failed to file timely disclosure reports as required by federal law and House rules.\n\nThe report says that from January 2017 when he took his seat in Congress until December 2021, Rutherford's publicly available reports disclose 157 late reports of transactions valued between $652,000 and $3.5 million.\n\nThe report said the majority of the late filings occurred during Rutherford's first two-year term, but he continued to file late disclosures \"in more recent years, including after several trainings on his disclosure obligations\" and while serving on the House ethics committee, which he joined in February 2021.\n\nThe report shows an $800 payment by Rutherford in November 2021 for fines related to late disclosures.\n\nThe report questions whether a full accounting has been done for what the fine amount should be and says the Office of Congressional Ethics could not determine whether Rutherford had been \"properly penalized for his repeated violations of federal law and House rules\" because he and his chief of staff Jen Bradley did not cooperate.\n\nThe report recommended the House ethics committee issue subpoenas to Rutherford and Bradley.\n\nKate Belinski, an attorney for Rutherford, said in a March 18 letter to the ethics committee the past late disclosures were \"an entirely inadvertent oversight\" by Rutherford and Bradley based on a \"simple misunderstanding of the requirements\" and human error.\n\nShe said Rutherford has since fully and accurately disclosed every transaction, \"paid all fines owed\" and put a new system in place for tracking and filing the transactions covered by the STOCK Act.\n\n\"Despite the fact that there was and is literally nothing to investigate, OCE (Office of Congressional Ethics) launched an unnecessary investigation at taxpayer expense and administrative burden,\" Belinski wrote.\n\nShe said Rutherford would continue to work with the ethics committee to resolve any outstanding questions but believes there are no remaining \"unresolved issues\" and \"this matter has already extended well beyond its logical conclusion.\"\n\nShe asked the committee to dismiss the referral and take no further action, but the committee's announcement Tuesday shows it wants to look more deeply into the matter.

The report even suggests possible witness tampering with the committee’s investigation.\n\nThe committee repeatedly uses forceful language to describe Trump’s intent: that he “purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud” in order to aid his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to successfully solicit about $250 million in political contributions. “These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.”\n\nThe full report, based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation by the nine-member bipartisan committee, will be released Wednesday, along with along with transcripts and other materials collected in the investigation.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report summary:\n\nThe committee thinks Trump and others committed crimes, and is referring them to DOJ\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Trump attorney John Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and John Eastman\n\nThe committee says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nIn addition, several others are named as being participants in the conspiracies the committee is linking to Trump, including then-DOJ attorney Jeffrey Clark and Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump-tied lawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nSeveral of the individuals named by the committee – including Trump, Eastman and Giuliani – had their own responses Monday.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the summary states.\n\nThe committee revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt also notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” the summary states, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nTrump’s belief that the election is stolen is no excuse, lawmakers say\n\nSources familiar with Trump’s legal strategy in the Justice Department probe have told CNN that his attorneys believe prosecutors face an uphill battle in proving he did not believe the election was stolen despite being told as much by senior members of his own administration.\n\nIn making its case for a Justice Department prosecution of Trump, the House committee took aim at that possible defense.\n\nIn describing why the committee believes Trump’s conduct meet the prongs of each criminal statute, the summary stresses evidence that Trump had been warned that his schemes were unlawful.\n\nTrump raised about $250 million by crying fraud\n\nThe committee says it gathered evidence indicating that Trump “raised roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in fundraising efforts between the election and January 6th. Those solicitations persistently claimed and referred to election fraud that did not exist.”\n\n“For example, the Trump Campaign, along with the Republican National Committee, sent millions of emails to their supporters, with messaging claiming that the election was ‘rigged,’ that their donations could stop Democrats from ‘trying to steal the election,’ and that Vice President Biden would be an ‘illegitimate president’ if he took office,’” the summary states.\n\nSeveral members of Congress are being referred to the House Ethics Committee\n\nThe select committee is referring several Republican lawmakers who refused to cooperate with the investigation to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy speaks to reporters at the US Capitol in Washington in November. Michael A. McCoy/Reuters\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, as well as Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona, could all face possible sanctions for their refusal to comply with committee subpoenas.\n\nConcerns about witness credibility and Trump-allied attorneys\n\nThe committee raised concerns that attorneys paid by Trump’s political committee or allied groups were incentivized to protect the former president, saying, “lawyers who are receiving such payments have specific incentives to defend President Trump rather than zealously represent their own clients. The Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney have been provided with certain information related to this topic.”\n\nIn one instance, a witness whose lawyer was being paid by a Trump-allied group was told she could “in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them.” When the witness raised concerns with her lawyer about that approach, the lawyer said, “They don’t know what you know, [witness]. They don’t know that you can recall some of these things. So you saying ‘I don’t recall’ is an entirely acceptable response to this,” according to the report summary.\n\nWhen it came to a specific issue that reflected negatively on Trump, the lawyer told his client, “No, no, no, no, no. We don’t want to go there. We don’t want to talk about that.”\n\nThe committee notes both Trump and his allies attempted to contact witnesses ahead of their committee testimony.\n\n“The Select Committee is aware of multiple efforts by President Trump to contact Select Committee witnesses. The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,” according to the summary.\n\nIvanka Trump and Kayleigh McEnany\n\nThe committee also, in its final report, highlighted two high-profile witnesses – Ivanka Trump and then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany – as being less cooperative than others. They and others “displayed a lack of full recollection of certain issues, or were not otherwise as frank or direct as Cipollone.”\n\nA video of Ivanka Trump is shown on screen during the seventh hearing held by the committee on July 12. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn another instance, Trump had an angry conversation with Pence in which he referred to the then-vice president as “The P word,” according to a committee interview with Ivanka Trump’s chief of staff, Julie Radford.\n\nIn Radford’s recollection, the name-calling was upsetting to Ivanka at the time, but when the committee asked Ivanka whether there were any “particular words” her father used in the conversation with Pence, “She answered simply: ‘No.’”\n\nThe summary states: “In several circumstances, the Committee has found that less senior White House aides had significantly better recollection of events than senior staff purported to have.”\n\nAs for McEnany, the committee called her testimony “evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points,” noting she was deposed early in the investigation and wasn’t as forthcoming as others from Trump’s press office.\n\nImpropriety by Trump Justice Department officials\n\nThe report points the finger at two Trump appointees at the Justice Department who the committee believes abused their positions and acted unethically.\n\nClark, the former acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, is already well known for trying to weaponize the Justice Department to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. The committee raises the prospect that Clark broke the law. The Justice Department is already investigating Clark and federal agents have searched his home.\n\nJeffrey Clark, speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington in September 2020. Susan Walsh/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most egregious things Clark did was draft a letter for the Justice Department to send to election officials in battleground states, urging them to essentially overturn their results. The letter, crafted with help from fellow Trump appointee Ken Klukowski, falsely asserted that the department believed there were problems with the results.\n\n“This was an intentional choice by Jeff Clark to contradict specific Department findings on election fraud, and purposely insert the Department into the Presidential election on President Trump’s behalf and risk creating or exacerbating a constitutional crisis,” the summary states.\n\nIn a new development, the panel flagged its concerns about Klukowski’s conduct.\n\nHe worked for the Trump campaign before joining the Justice Department during the final weeks of the administration. And while at the department’s civil division, he spent some of his time helping Clark with his attempts to overturn the election, “despite the fact that election-related matters are not part of the Civil portfolio,” the summary says.\n\nTrump and others may try this again, committee warns\n\nThe summary’s section outlining the referrals makes a case for why the Justice Department’s prosecutions should extend beyond the rioters who physically breached the Capitol.\n\nThe committee says that Trump “believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority.”\n\n“If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,” the summary says. “A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic.”\n\nThe summary revisits Trump’s infamous phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he begged Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to nullify Biden’s victory in the state. The summary also highlights that Trump doxed the leader of the Michigan Senate by tweeting out his cell phone number after he publicly said he wouldn’t undermine the election results.\n\nLawmakers also highlighted the plight of former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, who previously testified about the abuse they suffered when Giuliani and others in pro-Trump circles falsely accused them of rigging the results in Atlanta.\n\nLike Freeman and Moss, other officials who faced Trump’s ire received death and rape threats and an avalanche of phone calls and emails, and some of them feared for their safety.\n\nPardon requests show that Trump allies knew they were in possible legal jeopardy\n\nThe evidence that Trump allies sought pardons as the administration drew to a close shows that they knew their conduct was legally problematic, the committee argues.\n\nThe summary points to previously public accounts of pardon requests from members of Congress, while providing new details of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz’s alleged attempt for a pardon, which had been discussed in the public committee testimony of ex-White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson.\n\nCNN previously reported that the McEntee testimony linked Gaetz’s pardon request to a separate DOJ probe; Hutchinson, however, said Gaetz and others asked “blanket” pardons for participants at a meeting where election-related schemes were discussed.\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement agencies knew of threats of violence on January 6, but information didn’t get through\n\nThe summary of the report lays out how the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies were receiving information that January 6 was likely to be violent and shared that information with the White House and US Secret Service.\n\nFor example, on January 3, 2021, Department of Justice officials received an intelligence summary of plans to “occupy the Capitol” and “invade” the Capitol on January 6. According to testimony from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist predicted on a National Security Council call that the Capitol could be the target of violence.\n\n“I’ll never forget it,” Milley said in testimony revealed by the committee.\n\nThe panel suggests former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato failed to adequately serve as the intermediary between the intelligence community and the White House when it came to security updates ahead of January 6.\n\n“Ornato had access to intelligence that suggested violence at the Capitol on January 6th, and it was his job to inform Meadows and Trump of that. Although Ornato told us that he did not recall doing so, the Select Committee found multiple parts of Ornato’s testimony questionable,” the panel wrote.\n\nThe head of Trump’s security detail, Bobby Engel, testified to the committee that he shared critical information with Ornato as a means to convey messages to the White House.\n\nOrnato confirmed Engel’s understanding of information sharing, but when pressed on whether he talked to Meadows about concerns of the threat landscape going into January 6 said, “I don’t recall; however, in my position I would’ve made sure he was tracking the demos, which he received a daily brief, Presidential briefing. So he most likely was getting all this in his daily brief as well.”\n\nHope Hicks, former senior adviser to President Donald Trump, displayed on a screen during a hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022.

Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAides urged Trump to call for peaceful protests\n\nStaffers close to Trump told the committee they tried to get the then-president to act preemptively to quell concerns about January 6.\n\nHope Hicks, Trump’s former communications director, texted spokesman Hogan Gidley as the violence was unfolding on January 6 that she had “suggested…several times” on January 4 and 5 that Trump should publicly state that January 6 remain peaceful. Hicks also testified that Herschmann advised Trump to make a preemptive public statement ahead of January 6 calling for there to be no violence that day. No such statement was ever made.\n\nBy the time of Trump’s rally on January 6, the committee says testimony it received indicates that the former president had received a security briefing and that the Secret Service mentioned that there were prohibited items being confiscated from individuals trying to attend.\n\nMotorcade incident proves Trump’s intent to participate in overturning the election\n\nThe committee highlights Trump’s frustration with not being taken to the Capitol on January 6 as evidence that he intended to participate in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The Committee’s principal concern was that the President actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House Chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,” the summary of the report reads. “There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.”\n\nThe report details that the panel was ultimately unable to get Ornato to corroborate a bombshell moment during the public hearings, in which Hutchinson recalled Ornato describing Trump’s altercation with the head of his security detail when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol. The committee summary said both Hutchinson and a White House employee testified to the committee about the Ornato conversation. But “Ornato professed that he did not recall either communication, and that he had no knowledge at all about the President’s anger.”\n\nUltimately, the committee writes that it “has significant concerns about the credibility of this testimony” and vows to release his transcript publicly. Ornato did not recall conveying the information to Hutchinson or a White House employee with national security responsibilities, according to the report.\n\n“The Committee is skeptical of Ornato’s account.”\n\nThe panel writes that it has obtained evidence from “several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.” The panel cites multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police and national security officials in the White House who described Trump’s behavior as “irate,” “furious,” “insistent,” “profane” and “heated.”\n\nThe driver of Trump’s motorcade on January 6 testified to the committee:\n\nTrump’s former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after he returned to the White House.\n\n“So to the best of my recollection, I recall him being – wanting to saying that he wanted to physically walk and be a part of the march and then saying that he would ride the Beast if he needed to, ride in the Presidential limo,” McEnany said.\n\nAnother intent the committee’s report summary seeks to prove is that Trump’s call to his supporters to go the Capitol during his rally speech was pre-planned.\n\nFor example, the committee notes that January 6 rally organizer Kylie Kremer texted MyPIllow CEO Mike Lindell, “This stays only between us. … It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for it ‘unexpectedly.’”\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nTrump did, however, take the time to reach out to his attorney.\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states..\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nGOP lawmakers called for help\n\nThe committee also highlights real-time reactions from Republican members of Congress who have since downplayed the Capitol attack or defended Trump.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner described House GOP leader McCarthy as “scared” as McCarthy reached out to members of Trump’s family for help during the riot.\n\nIn a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote, “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” according to the summary.\n\nFILE - Violent rioters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nTrump’s reaction upon finding out the Capitol had been attacked: ‘Oh really?’\n\nThe committee reveals a conversation Trump had with a White House employee upon returning to the White House after his speech on January 6. Trump’s actions and conversations from when he returned to the White House to when he called off the rioters, referred to famously as the 187 minutes, continues to have huge gaps of information.\n\nHe asked the White House employee – whose identity the panel kept anonymous “to guard against the risk of retaliation” – if they had watched his rally speech on television. The White House employee responded, “Sir, they cut it off because they’re rioting down at the Capitol.”\n\nWhen Trump asked what they meant, the employee repeated:\n\nThe committee says DOJ has tools to get more information\n\nThe summary acknowledges the roadblocks the House committee ran into in its investigation and says the Justice Department has the tools – such as grand jury subpoena power – to knock down those obstacles.\n\nThe summary also notes the invocations of privilege made by former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone that prevented the committee from learning details about direct conversations with Trump. But the panels appears optimistic that a recent, under-seal court victory the DOJ secured will allow prosecutors to obtain that testimony from Cipollone.\n\n“Based on the information it has obtained, the Committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol,” the summary says.\n\nMore than 30 witnesses before the select committee exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused, on that basis, to provide testimony.

The House committee’s final report – to be released Wednesday – will provide justification from the panel’s investigation for recommending the charges.\n\nBut any move by the January 6 panel to approve a referral would be largely symbolic because a referral by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case.\n\nWith the federal investigation now being led by special counsel Jack Smith, it appears Justice Department investigators are already looking at much of the conduct that the select committee has highlighted.\n\nBut whether the department brings charges will depend on whether the facts and the evidence support a prosecution, Attorney General Merrick Garland has said. Garland will make the ultimate call on charging decisions.\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the January 6 committee, has said the panel could issue five to six other categories of referrals, such as ethics referrals to the House Ethics Committee, bar discipline referrals and campaign finance referrals.\n\nWhat are the crimes the January 6 committee is said to be considering for a Trump referral?\n\nThe committee is eyeing multiple alleged crimes for a referral of former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, CNN reported last week.\n\nAmong them are insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nFor the latter two, the lawmakers can rely on an opinion from a federal judge in California, who wrote earlier this year that there was evidence that Trump and his allies were plotting to defraud the US government and to obstruct an official proceeding. The opinion was handed down by US District Judge David O. Carter in a dispute over whether the House could access certain emails sent to and from former Trump attorney John Eastman.\n\nThe judge cited emails discussing Trump’s awareness that certain voter fraud claims being made in court were inaccurate as evidence of a plot to defraud the federal government. To explain his finding of evidence of obstruction, the judge pointed to emails that showed that the Trump team was contemplating filing lawsuits not to obtain legitimate legal relief, but to meddle in congressional proceedings.\n\nA House referral for an insurrection charge would be a more aggressive move. It’s a crime to assist or engage in “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws.” Judges have used the term “insurrection” to describe the January 6 attack on Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the Justice Department has not opted to bring the charge in its hundreds of US Capitol riot cases. Instead, prosecutors have relied on criminal statutes related to violence, obstruction of an official proceeding, and, in some limited cases, seditious conspiracy.\n\nWho else could be referred?\n\nThe panel has also weighed criminal referrals for a number of Trump’s closest allies including, Eastman, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, multiple sources told CNN earlier this month.\n\nAnother source cautioned at the time that while names were being considered, there was still discussion to be had before they were finalized.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/07/30/rep-david-schweikert-admits-11-ethics-violations-pay-50-000-fine/5362363002/", "title": "Rep. David Schweikert admits 11 ethics violations, to pay $50,000 fine", "text": "Rep. David Schweikert reached a deal announced Thursday to end a longstanding House Ethics Committee investigation by admitting to 11 rules violations, accepting a reprimand and agreeing to pay a $50,000 fine.\n\nThe committee found \"substantial evidence\" of violations by the five-term Arizona Republican stretching from 2010 into 2018 and faulted him for evasive, stalling tactics that helped him skirt more serious violations.\n\nAs it was, the violations the committee did find include undisclosed loans and campaign contributions; misuse of campaign funds for personal purposes; improper spending by his office; and an environment where office staffers were pressured to do political work.\n\nThe proposed deal caps an investigation that has cast a shadow over Schweikert’s political career since late 2017, when allegations of misspending first surfaced. The House of Representatives must adopt a resolution on the matter to make it final.\n\nIn a statement, Grace White, a spokeswoman for Schweikert, said he wanted to move ahead and didn't address the substantive issues in the probe.\n\n\"We are pleased the Committee has issued their report and we can move forward from this chapter. As noted in the review, all issues have been resolved and Congressman Schweikert will continue working hard for Arizona’s 6th District,\" she said.\n\nIn his response to the Ethics Committee, Schweikert acknowledged there were problems.\n\n\"I bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring that my congressional office and my campaign adhere to both the letter and spirit of the wide array of laws, rules, and regulations that govern our important work,\" he told the committee.\n\nBut the committee found that Schweikert was less than forthcoming and cooperative. His stonewalling tactics could be sanctioned by themselves, but the delays may have helped avert more serious problems for Schweikert, the committee wrote.\n\n\"Throughout the course of this investigation, Representative Schweikert made vague or misleading statements to the (investigative subcommittee) and (the Office of Congressional Ethics) that allowed him to evade the statute of limitations for the most egregious violations of campaign finance laws, his document productions were slow or non-responsive to several of the ISC’s requests for information regarding (Federal Election Commission) errors, and he gave self-serving testimony that lacked candor,\" the report said.\n\n\"Efforts like the ones Representative Schweikert undertook to delay and impede the ISC’s investigation were not only highly detrimental to the Committee’s work and reputation of the House, they were themselves sanctionable misconduct.\"\n\nThe committee’s report said Schweikert’s violations were a troubling example to avoid for other members of the House.\n\n\"While all of the violations detailed above were concerning, the Committee was disturbed by the events described in counts three and four … in particular. Those counts detailed how Representative Schweikert’s campaign committee falsely reported that he had loaned the campaign $100,000, when no such loan had been made, and then falsely reported making $100,000 in disbursements, which served to adjust the campaign’s reported cash on hand that was propped up by the fictitious loan,\" the report said.\n\n\"These errors were not only flagrant and egregious violations of campaign finance law, the falsely reported loan improperly inflated his campaign’s finances, thus making Representative Schweikert’s campaign appear to meet its financial goals while depriving the public of accurate and transparent accounting of the true state of his campaign.\"\n\nFor nearly two years, Schweikert publicly maintained the matter under investigation was little more than a bookkeeping dispute.\n\nAfter the separate Office of Congressional Ethics, which helps screen potential cases for the Ethics Committee, revealed its investigative findings against Schweikert's longtime former chief of staff, Oliver Schwab, in June 2019, Schweikert political adviser Chris Baker shifted tone. He acknowledged serious problems had existed and said Schweikert’s trust in Schwab \"was grossly misplaced.\"\n\nSchweikert struggled before report\n\nThe report deals another blow to Schweikert, whose Scottsdale-based congressional district is historically safe ground for the GOP. But the Republican-leaning district is the kind of suburban, relatively well-educated location that has drifted toward Democrats, especially in the Trump era.\n\nFor Schweikert, a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, the findings of misspending hit directly at the heart of his political persona as a budget and finance expert.\n\nIt also comes as Schweikert has struggled to mount a financially viable reelection campaign while Democrats have four candidates vying to challenge him in November.\n\nOne of them, Hiral Tipirneni, has $1 million more than Schweikert’s cash-strapped campaign.\n\nEntering July, only one House incumbent, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, had a larger cash deficit than Schweikert would if Tipirneni wins Tuesday’s Democratic primary.\n\nHis Democratic challengers seized on the report to argue his tenure should end.\n\nAnita Malik, who lost to Schweikert in 2018 and is again seeking the party's nomination, emphasized the 11 violations in a tweet.\n\n\"Finally admitting guilt is not enough. (Schweikert) has brought shame on #AZ06. His self interest and self preservation is the worst of politics,\" she wrote.\n\nTipirneni said Schweikert \"has violated his oath, abused his power, lied and misled, and betrayed the public trust.\"\n\n\"In using his taxpayer-funded congressional office in service of himself instead of our district, he has put his own interests above those of his constituents time and time again,\" Tipirneni said in a written statement.\n\nKarl Gentles said in a tweet the district has long known Schweikert's \"integrity and credibility was questionable at best. Now his colleagues have formally reprimanded him for his bad behavior. Voters must choose their next rep carefully, someone that will put #principlesoverpolitics and work for us not against us.\"\n\nEthics case snowballed\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates potential cases and refers them to the Ethics Committee, began scrutinizing Schweikert after the Washington Examiner published a story in November 2017 outlining spending problems involving Schwab.\n\nThe OCE investigation amassed a troubling paper trail, and passed that on to the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee has subpoena power and burrowed in even deeper.\n\nIn its 107-page report, the special subcommittee that examined Schweikert's case found that his \"campaign funds were used to reimburse staff for expenditures made for his personal use, including babysitting services, meals, dry-cleaning, and travel.\"\n\nAs the committee proceeded, Schweikert \"delayed responding to its requests and his testimony was punctuated by dissembling and incoherent statements.\"\n\nThe probe pored over Schweikert's personal, congressional and campaign finances, unspooling a trail of confusing transactions that effectively masked a candidate relying on his chief of staff to keep his campaign afloat.\n\nSchweikert's campaign committee disclosed a loan from him that wasn't made, and didn't disclose a loan or loan payments worth $205,000 that were made, the committee wrote.\n\nIn 2010, when Schweikert made his third run for Congress, he and his wife obtained a $75,000 line of credit using rental properties they owned to secure the deal. For several years, Schweikert used the credit to help fund his campaigns but didn't disclose the true nature of the money in his reports to the FEC.\n\nHe repaid the credit debt in full by 2015. While Schweikert created new campaign committees and turned to treasurers other than his wife, he didn't report the original line of credit, the committee found.\n\nEarly in the 2012 campaign cycle, when Schweikert defeated then-Rep. Ben Quayle, R-Ariz., in a hotly contested GOP primary, Schweikert's campaign reported a $100,000 loan from the candidate.\n\nBut he never made the loan. Schweikert told the committee he had been seeking another line of credit at the time.\n\n\"I had started the paperwork to do a credit line on the house, and in the chaos, maybe it just never got completed, and it [had] already been put down on the FECs. It should not have been done, it was a mistake,\" Schweikert told the committee.\n\nEven so, the loan wasn't taken off the books, the committee found.\n\nInstead, $100,000 was listed as paid out in four scattered amounts after the primary to a firm controlled by Schweikert's campaign consultant, Chris Baker. The payments were supposed to cover the costs of mailings, but those mailings were never made, the committee wrote.\n\nThe reports said Baker notified Schweikert in 2012 that his company had not received those payments.\n\nSchweikert told the committee the $100,000 payments were \"misreported,\" but the committee \"received no further explanation why the fictional disbursements were reported in the first place.\"\n\nA compliance firm that took over the campaign's books after the 2012 elections never learned about the nonexistent loan or the transactions that effectively erased it from the campaign's books, the report said.\n\nIn October 2013, Schweikert filed papers with the FEC saying the $100,000 he had loaned his campaign had been forgiven.\n\n\"If I was a better lawyer, but not having gone to law school, we probably should have done it a different way,\" he told the committee. \"But it still accomplishes the same thing, it cleaned it up.\"\n\nSchweikert didn't clear up the issue in more than a dozen FEC reports before closing the loan, and he didn't mention it to investigators for more than a year, the committee noted.\n\nThe committee said the fake loan suggested a more robust fundraising operation than actually existed.\n\nThe financial problems that dogged his early runs for Congress have continued to this day.\n\nIn three of the four quarters during the past year, Schweikert’s campaign spent more than it took in, a telltale sign of distress. Schweikert's campaign has spent heavily on legal fees throughout the investigation, cutting into his ability to run for reelection.\n\nLosing, winning, surviving\n\nSchweikert’s up-and-down congressional history includes debt-larded losses in 1994 and 2008 before he toppled former U.S. Rep. Harry Mitchell, D-Ariz., in the tea party-fueled wave election of 2010.\n\nSchweikert could not rest on his laurels with that victory because the state’s political lines were redrawn beginning with the 2012 elections.\n\nTo remain in office under the redrawn district lines, Schweikert had to defeat fellow GOP freshman U.S. Rep. Ben Quayle, the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle, in a 2012 primary.\n\nHe won, but the victory came at a high price.\n\nCampaign mailers raised questions of Quayle’s sexuality and a story in Politico citing unnamed sources said Quayle was among dozens of members of Congress who frolicked in the Sea of Galilee during a 2011 trip to Israel.\n\nSchweikert maintained he had not impugned Quayle the way many interpreted it, but to many Republicans, he had crossed a line.\n\nAt the same time, Schweikert had also weakened the political hand of then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, by voting against certain budget measures, among other acts of rebellion. After the 2012 elections, GOP leaders booted Schweikert and three other House Republicans from their committees.\n\nSchweikert, who lost a seat on the House Financial Services Committee, said at the time that the purge targeted “the more outspoken conservatives” and “there is retribution for voting your conscience now.”\n\nWhatever the reason, Schweikert was back on that committee after the 2014 elections and promoted to the Ways and Means Committee after the 2016 elections.\n\nBy then, Schweikert was a member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of activist conservatives who helped drive Boehner into retirement in 2015. Even so, Schweikert rarely bucked his party's leaders and was seen as a bridge to the party’s often-unruly right flank.\n\nA tougher road ahead\n\nAt the beginning of the Trump administration, Schweikert reliably stuck with his party’s two signature legislative efforts: the failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the successful passage of sweeping tax cuts that largely benefited corporations.\n\nEven with the cloud of the ethics investigation newly underway, Schweikert won a fifth term in 2018 by defeating Democrat Anita Malik by 10 percentage points. In three prior runs in the same district, Schweikert won by an average of 27 points.\n\nReach the reporter Ronald J. Hansen at ronald.hansen@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4493.

But health officials are seeing an increase in cases and hospitalizations since Thanksgiving, Walensky said. In the last week of November, the CDC reported:\n\n4,650 hospitalizations\n\n1,780 deaths\n\nRSV: Transmission remains high but appears to have \"peaked\" in the South and Southeast, and is \"leveling off\" in the mid-Atlantic, New England and Midwest, Walensky said\n\nInfluenza: Thirty-one jurisdictions in the United States, which includes states, major cities and territories, report a “very high” level of flu activity, and 16 report “high” levels, according to the CDC. So far this season, the agency has reported:\n\n8.7 million cases\n\n78,000 hospitalizations\n\n4,500 deaths\n\nFlu symptoms: What does flu feel like?\n\nFlu symptoms: Fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headache and fatigue.\n\nFlu strains: There are four types of influenza viruses – A, B, C and D – but the strains that typically cause seasonal flu illness are influenza A and B. The CDC says influenza C primarily causes mild disease and influenza D is normally seen in cattle, not people.\n\nHow long does the flu last?\n\nSigns and symptoms of the flu typically resolve after three to seven days, according to the CDC, but general weakness and fatigue can last up to two weeks.\n\nRead more vaccine news:\n\nFlu vaccine: Where to get the flu shot?\n\nThis year’s flu vaccine is a good match for the three strains Schaffner said he's seeing most often in Nashville. The prevalence of all three strains at the same time is what experts believe “accounts, at least in part, (for) why it is we’re having so much influenza,” he said.\n\nBut not enough people are getting vaccinated against the flu. About 40% of children were vaccinated as of Nov. 19 and about 36% of adults at the end of October, the latest data available from the CDC shows.\n\n“Here, as everywhere, the acceptance of the influenza vaccine has been disappointing,” he said. “People really have vaccine fatigue.”\n\nExperts say it's never too late to get a flu shot.

Patients can be tested simultaneously for COVID-19 and influenza with a single swab.\n\nHow to treat the flu\n\nExperts say most flu infections can be treated at home with rest and plenty of fluids. Doctors can, however, prescribe an antiviral to patients who are at risk of severe disease.\n\nFour antivirals are authorized for flu in the United States, but the most widely used is known by its brand name Tamiflu.\n\nBut antivirals work best when taken early in the disease, so it's important to discuss options with a doctor before getting sick, said Dr. Pedro Piedra, professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n\"We’re into the flu season now without a question, and there's a lot of it all around us,\" he said. \"Planning ahead is important.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub, USA TODAY.

Many children’s hospitals are overwhelmed after surges of RSV, while the level of influenza is the highest it has been at this point in the year for more than a decade. And after a lull in cases, new coronavirus infections are on the rise across the country as well.\n\nAll of this is happening as holiday season begins, with more people traveling and gathering indoors, likely with fewer precautions than in the previous two years.\n\nHow much should people be concerned? Which individuals should be the most cautious? Can people get all three viruses at the same time? What steps can be taken to reduce risk and stay safe? And should mandates such as masking and social distancing return?\n\nTo guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Seasonal flu: What you need to know 01:46 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN: Why should people be concerned about the convergence of RSV, influenza and Covid-19?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: There are several reasons to be concerned about this so-called tripledemic.\n\nOne is the impact at the societal level. Already, children’s hospitals across the United States are filled with kids infected with viruses, including RSV and influenza. Some experts speculate this is due to an immunity gap as a result of mitigation measures taken over the last two years. The situation is so bad that children’s health leaders have requested a formal declaration of emergency from the Biden administration to better assist these hospitals. (The administration has not declared an emergency, but the US Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter to governors last week saying it “stands ready to continue assisting you with resources, supplies, and personnel.”)\n\nWhen hospitals exceed capacity, care for patients suffers. People who come to the emergency department end up waiting much longer because there isn’t enough staff to care for them. Patients who need to be hospitalized may wait for days for a bed to open up. Some patients, especially in rural areas, may need to be transferred hours away for the care they need.\n\nThese delays could be harmful, even deadly. And this doesn’t just affect patients with respiratory ailments; it leads to delays in care for broken bones, asthma attacks and appendicitis, too, among other medical emergencies.\n\nAnother is the consequence for particularly vulnerable individuals. While most people who contract RSV, influenza, Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses will have mild symptoms, those most vulnerable could become severely ill, require intensive care and even die. The higher the rates of infection in their community, the more dangerous it becomes for vulnerable people.\n\nOf course, no one wants to be sick. Even a minor viral illness can cause inconvenience, such as missed work and school. And even if someone does not need to be hospitalized, they could still feel unwell and be contagious to others. So a high level of infection of these viruses is something that concerns all of us.\n\nCNN: Which people should be the most cautious during this period?\n\nWen: Individuals who should be most cautious are those are at the highest risk for severe illness. That includes older people, newborns and people with multiple chronic medical conditions. These are people most susceptible to viruses, and what is a mild infection to someone who is a healthy young adult could result in hospitalization for them.\n\nAnother group that should consider being cautious are those in direct contact with people at high risk. A spouse of someone who is immunocompromised, family members who live with elderly individuals, parents or caregivers to a newborn — these are all individuals who should reduce the risk of infection to themselves to prevent transmission to someone vulnerable in their immediate household.\n\nCNN: Can people contract all three viruses?\n\nWen: In theory, yes. Someone can certainly, over the course of a year, contract all three viruses. Generally, though, they don’t get them all at the same time. The “tripledemic” phrase refers to all three viruses surging in the population at once, not necessarily (and not usually) in the same person simultaneously.\n\nCNN: What steps can be taken to reduce risk and stay safe?\n\nWen: Vaccines exist for Covid-19 and for the flu to prevent severe disease and death. People should follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about staying up to date with their coronavirus and flu vaccine.\n\nThe coronavirus is airborne. Good ventilation helps to reduce spread, so gathering with others outdoors will be safer than indoors. Indoor settings can be lower risk if there is improved ventilation, for example, through open doors and windows and the use of HEPA filters.\n\nTesting for the coronavirus remains an important tool in combating the pandemic. Lindsey Wasson/Reuters\n\nInfluenza and RSV are spread primarily through droplets. People should stay away from those who are coughing and sneezing (and individuals with symptoms should avoid public settings). Everyone should wash their hands frequently — and well. That is especially important for young children who often put their hands in their mouths.\n\nThere are other important tools, too, including testing and masking. Taking a Covid-19 test before gathering can reduce risk, as can wearing a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask (KN95 or KF94).\n\nCNN: Is a cloth mask or regular medical mask enough?\n\nWen: No. The virus that causes Covid-19 is spread through microscopic droplets that can pass through cloth and regular medical masks. The N95 mask is the gold standard and will offer the best protection against respiratory viruses.\n\nThere will be some people who cannot tolerate an N95. Those individuals can wear two medical masks or a cloth mask on top of a medical mask. But these options are still not as protective as a well-fitting N95 or equivalent.\n\nCNN: Should mandates like masking and social distancing return?\n\nWen: I think it will be very difficult to ask everyone to return to masking, distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings with loved ones — especially over the holidays. My view is that top-down mandates from the any level of government should be reserved for truly dire situations for which there are no other options — for example, if a new highly transmissible variant emerges that is far more dangerous and resistant to existing vaccines. That’s not the situation at the moment.\n\nThat said, just because mandates across the board aren’t likely doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t take care themselves. Individuals — especially those vulnerable to severe illness and their household contacts — should choose to wear well-fitting N95s or equivalent while in crowded indoor spaces. They can choose additional protective measures, including staying outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces when possible. And everyone should make sure, again, that they are vaccinated with the vaccines that currently are available against Covid-19 and influenza.", "authors": ["Alex Rees"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/us/covid-rsv-flu-viruses-trifecta-hospitals/index.html", "title": "Covid, RSV and flu: A trifecta of respiratory viruses is taxing ...", "text": "Los Angeles CNN —\n\nAcross the country, overflow health care workers are struggling to catch their breath as hospitals fill with sick patients battling a trifecta of respiratory illnesses – Covid-19, RSV and the flu.\n\n“We’ve seen a real increase in cases … particularly since Thanksgiving,” said Dr. Christopher Longhurst, chief medical officer at UC San Diego Health, who added that the hospital is facing a respiratory surge. “Covid is up. The flu is up and other respiratory viruses are up as well.”\n\nThe situation is so overwhelming at UC San Diego Health, the hospital had to create space to triage patients by setting up tents in parking lots and using other unconventional spaces. The hallways in the emergency department are also full of temporary beds for patients who were admitted but are awaiting hospital beds.\n\n“We have not had to reconfigure conference room space to care for patients even during the Covid pandemic,” said Longhurst, who explained that UC San Diego Health has experienced an equal number of Covid patients as patients with other respiratory viruses. “These are really unprecedented times.”\n\nLast week, hospitals across the nation were the fullest they have been throughout the pandemic, reaching 80% capacity, which is an 8 percentage-point jump in two weeks. That’s also the highest level since the Omicron surge in January. This week, hospital capacity has improved slightly.\n\nWhile RSV appears to have peaked in the US, both Covid and flu infections are on the rise.\n\nAll but seven states are experiencing high or very high respiratory virus activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC advises that people in areas with high Covid-19 community levels wear a mask.\n\nDr. Jeff Smith, executive vice president and chief operating officer for hospital operations at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said the “extreme, rapid rise” of RSV from October into November was likely “the most RSV we’ve seen in the past decade.”\n\n“And now we’ve seen a rapid decline (in RSV),” said Smith. “That has overlapped this Covid rise, which has happened a little bit slower and a little bit later, and then now is superimposed by this very rapid rise in influenza.”\n\nDr. Christopher Longhurst, chief medical officer at UC San Diego Health, said they've seen a significant increase in cases, particularly since Thanksgiving. \"Covid is up. The flu is up and other respiratory viruses are up as well.\" From UC San Diego Health\n\nYet the surge of this virus trio is still not as bad as Covid was during the apex of the pandemic.\n\n“The most powerful factor by far is probably the vaccines, but the other one is the cumulative number of infections we have all had which is now called natural immunity,” said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, an infectious disease specialist at Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n“Unfortunately, there’s still about a third of the country … where despite all the evidence of safety and efficacy, people are still not getting vaccinated,” he said.\n\nThere are vaccines for both Covid and the flu, but not for RSV. All three of the viruses present very similar symptoms – fever, cough and upper respiratory symptoms – so testing is required to determine which illness it is and recommend treatment.\n\nAnd just because a patient has one virus doesn’t mean they can’t get the other two as well.\n\n“I’ve seen one case of three infections occurring at the same time,” said Jones-Lopez. “These are independent viruses that can infect the same individual and, obviously, the more viruses, the more infections you have … the higher the risk of one of them leading to more serious disease.”\n\nMask mandates have not yet returned, but virus spikes in New York, Los Angeles and Seattle have led health departments to recommend people mask up indoor and in crowds.\n\nBut as friends and family gather this month, health officials are concerned.\n\n“I certainly would recommend that if you are elderly or have an illness that makes you immunocompromised or particularly susceptible to infection, I would encourage wearing a mask now,” said Smith of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. “It’s the best protection that we have for anyone else who is concerned about transmission.”\n\nOr, as Longhurst put it, “Wear a mask during the holiday season and don’t kiss those sick babies.”", "authors": ["Stephanie Elam"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/health/flu-slowing-but-still-bad/index.html", "title": "Flu activity remains high but shows signs of slowing in parts of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flu season that hit the United States early and hard is showing the first signs of slowing in parts of the country.\n\nFor the first time this season, flu hospitalizations have dropped week-over-week.

Like last week, all but seven states continue to have “high” or “very high” respiratory virus activity, according to the CDC.\n\nThe holiday season is well underway too, and experts have warned that holiday gatherings could increase the spread of respiratory viruses.\n\nAs of December 10, the CDC estimates that there have been at least 15 million illnesses, 150,000 hospitalizations and 9,300 deaths from flu this season.\n\nThis season’s cumulative hospitalization rate is higher than it’s been in more than a decade. And even with the signs of improvement, millions more were infected last week, and thousands died.\n\nHealth leaders continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination, especially as Covid-19 ramps up again and the strain on hospitals persists.\n\n“We have the tools, we have the infrastructure, and we have the know-how to manage this moment,” White House Covid-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Thursday.\n\nUptake of both the updated Covid-19 booster shot and the annual flu vaccine is lower than experts would like.\n\nOnly about 40% of adults and 46% of children have received their flu shot this season, far below the target rate of 70% set by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People 2030 plan.\n\nThe CDC on Friday also published new estimates for flu vaccine coverage among adults, which show that vaccine coverage among White people (45%) and Asian people (47%) is much higher than it is for Black people (33%), Hispanic people (28%) and American Indian people (26%).

New York City, Los Angeles County and Phoenix’s Maricopa County are among those areas.\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations have been on the rise since early November, and older people are bearing the brunt of these serious illnesses. Hospitalization rates are four times higher for seniors than for any other age group.\n\nIn the first week of December, the US had the most Covid-19-related deaths in months. Even with vaccines and treatments widely available, the CDC reported nearly 3,000 deaths for that week.\n\nAs it stands, there have been at least 99.2 million Covid-19 cases and more than 1.08 million deaths in the US, according to the CDC.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that this Covid-19 season does not have to be like last winter’s, when there was a large spike in cases with the rise of the Omicron coronavirus variant.\n\n“We have the tools, we have the infrastructure, and we have the know-how to manage this moment,” White House Covid-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said at a briefing.\n\nThe Biden administration has been in daily contact with state and local public health leaders, monitoring hospital levels, he said. And the federal government has medical personnel, supplies and other resources ready if states and communities need them.\n\nThe government is also reopening Covidtests.gov for a limited time so more Americans can get access to free tests. Each household in the US can order up to four at home tests that ship as early as next week.\n\nJha added that although “Covid isn’t the disruptive force it once was,” the country is prepared “no matter what the virus throws at us.”\n\nPush for more vaccinations\n\nHowever, more people still need to get boosted and vaccinated.\n\nOnly about 14% of eligible Americans have gotten an updated Covid-19 booster, and 1 in 5 people in the US remain completely unvaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nSurvey data published Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found less than half of adults in the US are worried that Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations will increase this winter, and even fewer – only about a third – are worried that they will get seriously sick from the virus. These findings are based on KFF’s ongoing COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor project, and the latest survey was conducted from November 29 to December 8.\n\nOnly about 4 in 10 adults say they have gotten the updated booster or plan to do so as soon as possible, although federal data shows that the risk of Covid-19-related hospitalization is four times lower for adults who are up to date on their Covid-19 vaccines than for those who are unvaccinated.\n\nDemocrats are nearly four times more likely than Republicans to say they have gotten the updated booster shot or plan to. Among Republicans, skepticism is the driving factor. Even among those who have gotten their initial Covid-19 vaccine series, more than 60% said they “don’t think they need the new booster” or “don’t think the benefit is worth it.” Democrats were most likely to say they haven’t gotten the new booster because they are “too busy or have not had the time.” But even a quarter of Democrats surveyed say that they don’t think they need the new booster.\n\nAs at other times in the pandemic, groups who have been disproportionately affected by severe outcomes from Covid-19 – including seniors, as well as Black and Hispanic adults – were more likely than others to worry about rising cases and hospitalizations.\n\nPublic health officials have specifically stressed the importance of seniors being up to date on their vaccinations. Seniors were more likely than any other age group in the survey to say they have gotten the updated booster or plan to – the only age group with more than 50% expected uptake – but more than a third of seniors say they don’t think they need the new booster or don’t think the benefit is worth it.\n\nMost parents in the survey do not plan to have their children get the updated Covid-19 booster shot. Only 30% of parents of children 5 to 11 and 42% of parents of adolescents 12 to 17 say they have gotten the booster or plan to do so.\n\nAbout half of parents are worried that their child will get seriously ill from the flu, RSV or Covid-19 this season – but flu and RSV slightly outrank Covid-19.\n\nPrevention and treatment\n\nJha said on CNN on Thursday that people who test positive for Covid-19 should “be evaluated for treatment,” especially those 50 and older and anyone with chronic conditions.\n\nTreatments can reduce a person’s risk of being hospitalized or dying from Covid-19, but Paxlovid works best if started within days of when symptoms appear.\n\n“We want to encourage people to use those tools, and given how widespread and how available those tools are, I think if people did that, we could get through” the Covid-19 season, Jha said.\n\nPublic health officials are beginning to recommend a return to one of those tools: masking in public places.\n\nIn Philadelphia, when schoolchildren come back from the winter break, they will be required to wear masks for 10 days as a “proactive measure” to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses, a district spokesperson said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC recommends masking for anyone who’s on public transportation.

Meanwhile, in the US, most Americans are resigned to the idea that Covid-19 will not be gone in their lifetime and many feel a return to masking is unpleasant.\n\nThe current rise in Covid-19 cases is one leg of a triple threat – a “tridemic,” a “tripledemic” or a “trifecta,” as some news organizations are calling it – along with a bad flu season and an RSV outbreak hitting mainly children.\n\nRELATED: Get the full report on the three viruses from CNN’s Jacqueline Howard.\n\nPeople are coughing and sick. Hospitals are stressed. Some local public health officials are warning that indoor masking could return.\n\nThose warnings come just as the federal government moves in the opposite direction with vaccines. The House on Thursday passed a defense bill that rescinds a Covid vaccine requirement for members of the military.\n\nIn Los Angeles, where there is moderate but increasing Covid-19 spread, county public health director Barbara Ferrer said on December 1 that if case levels and strain on hospitals continue to rise, “then we would go ahead and follow the CDC guidance, which includes universal indoor masking.”\n\nWhat is the CDC guidance?\n\nThe official US government guidance for individuals has not changed since September. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends masking for everyone on public transportation (requirements have lapsed). But masking is only recommended in other public settings for all people in communities where there is a high level of transmission. People at higher risk of getting sick should wear masks when there is medium spread, such as in Los Angeles County.\n\nCDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters Monday that about 5% of the population currently lives in a county with high spread. CDC’s county-level data suggests more than two-thirds of Americans live in an area with low transmission, but that cases are rising.\n\nWalensky said the most important protection for people against the triple threat is to stay up to date on Covid-19 vaccines and boosters and to get an annual flu shot. Also, stay home when you’re sick, please.\n\nNot talking about mandates\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the outgoing director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser, also talked about the need to mask up during his final White House briefing in late November.\n\nFrom his perspective, no one is talking about mask mandates since Americans have the tools to stay safe.\n\nPay attention to Fauci’s wording when he said that along with vaccines and testing for flu and Covid-19, “We have the option, under certain circumstances, with good judgment, to wear masks where appropriate in indoor congregate settings.”\n\nHe also said it’s important to view masks as one part of a strategy to keep yourself safe.\n\n“You can count masking, vaccines, boosting, testing – all of that is part of the spectrum of protecting yourself and your family,” Fauci said.\n\nUse common sense\n\nHe reiterated that sentiment in an exit interview with NBC News, where he suggested that people should mask where appropriate, but was careful to say it’s only a recommendation.\n\n“I am not talking about mandating anything,” Fauci said. “I’m talking about just common sense of saying, ‘You know, I really don’t want to take the risk of myself getting infected, and even more so, spreading it to someone who is a vulnerable member of my family.’”\n\nDon’t feel guilty\n\nThat personal evaluation is important, he said, because different people have different risk.\n\nA reporter at the White House briefing argued the word “masking” has become pejorative in some places.\n\n“No, it shouldn’t be,” Fauci said. “I know sometimes when you walk in and you have a mask and nobody has a mask, you kind of feel guilty. You shouldn’t feel guilty.”\n\nPeople have largely moved on\n\nHalf of Americans said in an Axios-Ipsos survey released this week that they’ve completely returned to their pre-Covid routines.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Americans said they were wearing a mask not often or never outside the home. Just 14% said their employer required mask wearing.\n\nIn hindsight, mask requirements may have helped drive a growing skepticism of public officials. Nearly half, 45%, agreed in the Axios-Ipsos survey with the idea that public health officials lied to the public about the efficacy of masks and vaccines at preventing the virus’ spread.\n\nBut if Covid-19 cases were to increase, a little less than two-thirds of Americans, 65%, said they would wear a mask.\n\nStaying practical\n\n“Most Americans have had a practical attitude towards masking and mask requirements,” Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs at Ipsos, told me in an email. “When people felt at risk of COVID they wore masks and were supportive of requirements. But now with most people feeling the risk to them is pretty low, few are wearing or support requirements to wear masks.”\n\nThe last time Ipsos asked about support for mask requirements was in July, when 45% supported local government requirements, down from more than two-thirds support in January 2022.\n\nMasks work\n\nMasks do cut down on the spread of Covid-19, even in schools, according to a recent Harvard University study documented in The New York Times that looked at Covid-19 cases in two school districts that continued requiring masks after the rest of Boston area districts made them optional in the spring.\n\nThis will be the conundrum for public health officials if Covid-19 cases continue along with this “tripledemic” – how to get people to wear masks without trying to make them do it.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Covid-19 cases are on the rise, too, and a CNN analysis showed that hospitals are at higher capacity now than they have been throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhat can families do in advance of holidays gatherings and what measures can they implement during the festivities to keep viruses at bay? When should everyone wear masks? How can people reduce the risk of getting sick on flights and during transit? Who might want to consider postponing travel and holiday celebrations? And what should people do if they do become ill after gatherings?\n\nTo help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: What can families do now to preserve their holiday get-togethers as much as possible?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: It’s always important to stay healthy, and particularly so before the holidays. Even if people aren’t so concerned about getting ill, no one wants to become infected just before a long-awaited holiday get-together and have to miss events for fear of transmitting viruses to elderly loved ones and other high-risk family and friends.\n\nMy advice is to first identify which gatherings are most important for you to attend. Count backward from the first of these events. For about five days to a week before that first event, try to reduce your risk of catching respiratory viruses as much as possible.\n\nThis year's winter holidays and celebrations are taking place during multiple viral surges. sonyakamoz/Adobe Stock\n\nThat includes frequent handwashing, especially after touching frequently used surfaces. Wear a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask in all indoor crowded settings. And try to reduce unmasked social gatherings during this period.\n\nIf you have not already received the flu vaccine or the updated Covid-19 booster, do not delay. The vaccines reach optimal protection about two weeks after the inoculation, but even if it’s a little bit less than that until your events, there will still be some additional protection.\n\nI’d also encourage you to have a discussion with all the households that are getting together with you. Ideally, everyone who is gathering should reduce their risk, too. If there are vulnerable individuals expected at the gatherings, everyone should agree not to attend if they develop symptoms like fever and coughing.\n\nCNN: What measures can help keep viruses at bay during the gatherings?\n\nWen: Many respiratory infections like influenza, RSV and the common cold are primarily spread through droplets. Droplets are expelled when someone coughs or sneezes. This is why encouraging people not to attend if they are symptomatic is important, and so is good hand hygiene.\n\nThe coronavirus is airborne and spread through aerosols, which are tiny, microscopic droplets. Good ventilation helps to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. If you live in a warm weather environment, consider hosting your gathering outdoors — that will be lower risk than indoors.\n\nIf outdoors is not possible, consider your setting. Can you choose a larger space where people don’t need to cluster very close together? Can you keep some windows and doors open, and run HEPA filters for improved ventilation?\n\nFor Covid-19 specifically, having everyone take a rapid home antigen test the same day as the gathering can also reduce risk. You may choose to provide the tests at the door to better ensure that everyone takes one.\n\nWearing a mask also reduces risk, too. Some people, especially if they are immunocompromised or have other chronic underlying conditions, may wish to mask during the gathering, though this is often challenging when food and drinks are involved.\n\nCNN: A lot of people need to travel to be with their loved ones. What can be done to reduce the risk of getting sick on flights and during transit?\n\nWen: Expect that airports, train stations and bus depots will be quite crowded during the holidays and plan ahead to reduce your risk in these crowds. If your goal is to keep safe during the holidays, I highly recommend masking in these settings. Even if you have returned to pre-pandemic activities and stopped masking months ago, I think it’s a good idea to get your mask back out in these crowds so that you don’t become sick and end up having to miss holiday gatherings.\n\nHigh-quality respiratory masks, such as N95, KN95 or KF94, are very protective against droplets. Figure out, if you have not already, which masks you can wear comfortably for long periods of time during transit. Bring several with you in case one of them gets soiled or bent out of shape.\n\nEveryone should have a plan for what happens if they develop a viral illness while traveling, says Dr. Leana Wen. Yelizaveta Tomashevska/Adobe Stock\n\nI encourage you to wear masks the whole time while traveling around a lot of people. If you find masks uncomfortable, at least wear them during the highest risk settings — for example, when packed together with dozens of other people waiting to board the plane.\n\nCNN: Who might want to consider postponing travel and/or holiday celebrations?\n\nWen: The threat of respiratory infections requires weighing risks and benefits. For most generally healthy people, especially if they are vaccinated against the flu and Covid-19, the benefits of holiday gatherings — including the socialization and mental health benefits — will far outweigh potential risks.\n\nThe calculation may be different for some individuals who are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes. These individuals may need to gauge each event separately. A small gathering with relatives who all took precautions in advance, who are doing a Covid-19 test at the door, and who are seeing one another in a well-ventilated space is much lower risk compared with, say, a New Year’s Eve celebration with hundreds of people who have not taken precautions.\n\nTravel is generally not the major concern; one-way masking with a high-quality mask works very well to protect the wearer. I’m much more concerned about the risk of the gathering once people are together.\n\nPeople who are particularly vulnerable should clarify the precautions in advance with the hosts. Importantly, they should feel empowered to leave if the event turns out to be higher risk than they anticipated.\n\nCNN: What should people do if they do become ill while traveling?\n\nWen: This is a very important point. Everyone should have a plan for what happens if they develop a viral illness while traveling. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a checklist of what a Covid-19 plan looks like. That includes, for example, making sure you have enough home tests, speaking with your doctor to know if you are high-risk, and having a plan for treatment, including with the antiviral medication Paxlovid.\n\nSince it’s not just Covid-19 that’s circulating, also have a plan for what happens if you or someone in your party develops the flu or other respiratory infections. Do you know where you can isolate if needed? What if a young child becomes ill — will you be able to quarantine with your child and then take time off from work if necessary?\n\nThis holiday season, there are a lot of circulating viruses, but we also have many tools that help to reduce the risk of contracting them and becoming severely ill. Using these tools helps to keep us healthy, and allows us to keep viruses from interfering with our holiday celebrations.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2022/12/08/rsv-flu-covid-19-symptoms-how-prevent-and-soothe-during-recovery/10858243002/", "title": "RSV, flu, COVID-19 symptoms: How to prevent and soothe during ...", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nExperts warn that infectious diseases will be particularly nasty this holiday season. This is largely owed to the presence of a \"tripledemic\" consisting of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza (the flu). The presence of all three at once means that infections and transmissions will be harder to avoid. Experts state that the flu is particularly bad this year, with the most December cases in a decade.\n\n►More: Experimental flu shot aims to target 20 influenza viruses in a single vaccine\n\nYou'll need to use caution if you want to keep yourself and others safe from infection. Taking preventative measures such as getting vaccinated and wearing a mask can help in this regard, though it’s impossible to guarantee that you won’t get sick. If you do find yourself or someone in your household sick, there are several ways to help you have a speedy recovery and ease discomfort. Talk to your doctor about how to best care for your symptoms.\n\nGet on the nice list. Sign up for our newsletter to get all the best gift guides, deals and holiday planning advice.\n\nCOVID symptoms\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these are the symptoms associated with COVID-19: Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle/body aches, headache, new loss of taste and/or smell, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nFlu symptoms\n\nThe flu can present similar symptoms to COVID-19. According to the CDC, flu symptoms can include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, muscle/body aches, headaches and fatigue. Vomiting and diarrhea are also possible symptoms, but they are more common in children than adults.\n\nRSV symptoms\n\nRSV is a respiratory virus that usually causes mild symptoms, but can be serious for infants or adults with compromised immune systems. Symptoms of RSV can include runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. In young infants, RSV can also present irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties.\n\nFace masks\n\nMasks provide an effective method in curbing the spread of COVID-19, the flu and RSV. This is because properly filtrated masks can stop the transmission of airborne particles from one person to another. The key phrase here is “properly filtrated,” as cloth masks aren't as effective at filtering tiny particles. Instead, health officials recommend that individuals opt for three-ply masks such as N95 and KN95. Both masks have 95% filtration efficiency, meaning they're the gold standard when it comes to protection. While there are many places to buy these masks online, you should take caution and avoid sellers who offer counterfeit masks, which offer less protection.\n\nReusable water bottle\n\nA water bottle is helpful for use before and after getting sick. If you’re understandably wary of using public fountains because of germs, you can use a water bottle instead. If that doesn’t work and you find yourself sick, drinking water is vital for a speedy recovery. Drinking can help flush toxins through your system and keeps you hydrated if you’re losing liquids from various symptoms. The Brita filtering water bottle is the best we've ever tested because it's inexpensive, lightweight and comes equipped with a filter for premium taste. It even has a straw perfect for use when you're sick and don't feel like moving a muscle. The stainless-steel insulation will keep your water cold for up to 24 hours.\n\nDisinfectant wipes\n\nWhile the risk of becoming infected through contact with surfaces is lower than breathing in infected particles, it never hurts to use disinfectant wipes to clean highly used surfaces like tables, doorknobs and light switches. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectant wipes that are approved to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as Lysol, can be found easily. This pack of four can be stored at home or taken on the go.\n\nHand sanitizer\n\nWhile washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds is the best way to fight germs, a squeeze of hand sanitizer goes a long way when you’re in a pinch. When buying sanitizer, make sure the formula contains at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the CDC.\n\nAir purifier\n\nWhile an air purifier alone is not enough to protect you or others from germs, when used in combination with other CDC-recommended safety measures, air filtration can be an effective component of transmission reduction. Plus, air purifiers can remove irritants and pollutants that worsen allergies. The Blueair DustMagnet 5410i is the best air purifier we've ever tested thanks to its quietness, exceptional particle removal and integration with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.\n\nThermometer\n\nSeeing as all three ailments are associated with fevers (defined as a temperature above 100.4º F), a thermometer is useful to have at home to monitor symptoms. The Vicks SpeedRead thermometer is a classic oral thermometer that’s easy to read, can be washed in water and is inexpensive. If you want a no-touch forehead thermometer, you should get one offered by Femometer, which is highly rated because of its reliability, ease of use among children and adults alike and lower price tag.\n\nPulse oximeter\n\nAn oximeter is a medical device that attaches to your finger to measure oxygen saturation in the blood. Low oxygen could be indicative of a medical issue, including COVID-19 or RSV. Oxygen saturation below 90 percent is considered hypoxic, meaning that there’s a lower level of oxygen than what is considered healthy in the blood.\n\nAt-home COVID-19 test\n\nAs symptoms of the flu, RSV and COVID-19 can often overlap, a good way to see if you have COVID-19 specifically is by testing yourself. At-home COVID-19 tests are a convenient way to get tested and can give you results in as little as 15 minutes.\n\nHumidifier\n\nWhen it comes to COVID-19, the CDC specifically recommends humidifiers to ease symptoms. Humidifiers can also relieve a stuffy nose associated with other ailments like the flu. Plus, with the weather getting colder, you’ll have to contend with dry skin, lips and sinuses. With all of this in mind, you should get yourself a quality warm mist humidifier like the LEVOIT humidifier, which we found to be the best on the market. This humidifier can help return moisture to your home, and in the process, soothe sore throats and dry noses.\n\nEssential oil diffuser\n\nAn essential oil diffuser is another nifty gadget that can give relief to some of your symptoms. Not only will it add extra moisture to your room, but depending on the oil you use, it may help clear your sinuses or make it easier to fall asleep. The Saje Aroma Om is the best essential oil diffuser we’ve tested because it’s made of high-quality material, is easy to use and has a cool design.\n\nTissues\n\nThe only thing worse than having a runny nose is having rough tissue to wipe your nose with or worse yet, having no tissues at all. To save yourself from these horrifying scenarios, we recommend stocking up on Puffs Ultra Soft tissues, our favorite tissues because of how soft yet durable they are.\n\nElectric kettle\n\nWhen you're sick, a hot cup of chamomile tea can go a long way. In order to brew it up quickly so you can get back under the covers, you'll need an efficient electric kettle. The PerfecTemp by Cuisinart is our absolute favorite and has the fastest boiling time out of all the models we tested. If you're trying to live a more frugal lifestyle, you can opt for our budget pick, Hamilton Beach’s Electric Tea Kettle. It's less expensive but still performs like a high-end electric kettle.\n\nSleep mask\n\nFatigue is an unfortunate side effect of many illnesses, but what’s worse is that being sick can make it much harder to fall asleep. A good sleep mask is essential for getting some shuteye no matter what time of day it is. The Mzoo sleep mask is the best we’ve tested because of its comfortable fabric that provides room for your eyes so that they're not uncomfortably pressed against the mask.\n\nWeighted blanket\n\nWeighted blankets offer not only the rest needed when you’re sick, but comfort, too. They have a calming effect with their gentle pressure and coziness that can improve sleep and relaxation. Gravity Blanket ranks as the best weighted blanket we've tested because it provides the perfect amount of pressure, it's easy to clean and will last you for years to come. It doesn't come cheap, so as a budget option we recommend the YnM Weighted Blanket, which is cozy and well-constructed for a fraction of the price.\n\nHeating pad\n\nWith various ailments causing chills and body aches, having a heated pad will bring much-needed relief if you find yourself afflicted with either. The best electric heating pad we've ever tested is the BodyMed Digital Moist Heating Pad. It heats fast, maintains a steady high temperature and is easy to use. If you prefer a less expensive, microwavable pad, check out the one offered by Caylee's Creations. It's soft, machine-washable and doubles as a cold compress when you freeze it.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nIt's been over two years since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the ways in which we navigate the virus have changed. Masks were once ubiquitous in many cities across the nation. Now, Americans are increasingly leaving them at home owing to increased vaccination rates and the easing of mask restrictions. Many mask mandates across the country have been dropped, including on public transportation as of April 2022.\n\nDespite this, the coronavirus remains a threat with rising cases and a new omicron strain, the BA.5 variant, spreading across the nation. With 37.8% of Americans still not fully vaccinated, many are still at risk of contracting and spreading the virus. President Biden tested positive for COVID-19 last Thursday and spent about a week in isolation until he finally tested negative this morning. With new variants and strains of COVID-19 being more easily transmissible, it’s important to take proper precautions to protect yourself and those around you.\n\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.

Instead, you’ll want to upgrade to medical masks like N95 and KN95. However, finding and buying legitimate N95 masks isn't as straightforward as purchasing cloth or surgical masks. With limited supplies early on, many manufacturers only offered N95 respirators in bulk for healthcare settings at the beginning of the pandemic. And while they're widely available now, there are a lot of counterfeit masks to sort through.\n\nThat said, it is possible for consumers to purchase legitimate N95 masks at a fair price and we're here to guide every step in the process. Here's what you should know when buying N95 and KN95 masks and where you can buy them online.\n\n►Related: Visitors will need to mask up again in some parts of Denali National Park and Preserve\n\n►More: What to bring – and what to leave behind – on your first vacation since COVID\n\nWhy choose N95 masks?\n\nN95 masks have been predominately used in healthcare settings even before the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool to achieve highly efficient filtration against airborne particles. However, as the virus has evolved and become more contagious, many experts are advocating for the use of N95 and K95 masks to prevent the spread of the virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everybody above the age of two should wear a well-fitting mask where the COVID-19 Community Level is high, no matter one’s vaccination status.\n\nThe argument for wearing an N95 is that it's the gold standard of face coverings. With the proper fit, masks approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) can filter up to 95% of particles in the air. When dealing with a respiratory virus like this coronavirus, N95 masks can make a large difference in protection from infection.\n\nSeveral studies have and continue to explore the efficacy of different kinds of masks, especially as the pandemic continues to evolve. Take this experiment researchers at Duke University conducted in 2020, testing different kinds of masks against each other to see which mask was the most effective in blocking respiratory droplets. Taking factors like correct fit and environmental variables into account, the N95 masks were the most effective in blocking droplets—99% to be exact. The next best mask? Surgical masks, followed by a double-layered, polypropylene-cotton mask (a.k.a., a cloth mask).\n\nDr. Sabrina Assoumou, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center, is among the experts recommending upgraded masks: \"If you're in an indoor public setting, that's where we recommend that you wear a well-fitted, high-quality mask. With omicron and how transmissible it is, I feel that we should all be moving to wearing a higher quality, better mask.\"\n\n►Recent: Los Angeles indoor mask mandate could return as COVID cases, hospitalizations surge nationwide\n\nN95 vs KN95 vs KF94: What to know\n\nYou may have seen talk about both N95 and KN95 masks, sometimes—and inaccurately—used interchangeably. At face value, they're similar, and both are rated with 95% filtration efficiency. The main difference between the two boils down to what country or organization certified the standard of quality of the masks. N95 masks are NIOSH-certified, while KN95s—which the CDC notes are the most widely available mask—are manufactured in China and meet standards specific to China. KF94 masks, which provide a unique shape in comparison to N95s and KN95s, are manufactured in Korea and meet the Korean standard requirements.\n\nIn 2020, the FDA granted emergency-use authorization (EUA) for some KN95 masks due to N95 masks supply being scarce. However, the FDA has since revoked the EUA of non-NIOSH-approved respirators because some KN95 masks may not necessarily meet U.S. standards in terms of filtration. Even more, the CDC estimates that about 60% KN95 respirators in the U.S. are counterfeit as well as fail to meet NIOSH standards. Because of this gap, it may be best to stick to NIOSH-approved respirators approved by the CDC.\n\nHowever, some people may prefer KN95s and KF94s for everyday use in non-medical settings. N95s can feel restrictive for some due to their protective layered construction, so a KN95 or KF94 could be a suitable alternative for those who are not comfortable wearing an N95 for long periods of time. \"I recently upgraded to using more KN95s —upgrading meaning from either cloth masks or surgical masks—for indoor public settings,\" says Assoumou. \"If you can find a KN95 or KF94 mask, those are helpful because they're just a little more comfortable and tolerable.\"\n\nWhat you should know about buying N95 masks\n\nWhen shopping for an N95 mask, you can check the CDC's list of NIOSH-approved N95 respirators to confirm that the mask you're looking at has been tested and meets NIOSH regulations. All masks we list as \"NIOSH-approved\" have been cross-referenced with the NIOSH-approved list.\n\nYou can choose to wear \"industrial\" N95 masks that are often sold at hardware stores. \"The FDA expanded under emergency uses authorization approval for industrial respirators that are not traditionally used in healthcare settings,\" Dr. Cassandra Pierre, infectious disease specialist at Boston Medical Center, tells us. You'll still want to make sure that the industrial N95 masks are on that NIOSH-approved list and provide a proper, tight fit on your face.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for N95 respirator masks for kids, know that N95s are nearly non-existent in kids' sizes, as parenting staff writer Janelle Randazza reports. The NIOSH only regulates products for adults—so, while an N95 mask might not be an option for your children, protective KN95 or KF94 masks designed for smaller faces or kids are an alternative solution. Many of them are made from the same brands as N95 masks—such as Powecom and WellBefore—and are sold by reputable distributors like Bona Fide Masks and Project N95.\n\nWhere to buy N95s and KN95s masks online and in-store\n\nThere are many pharmacies that offer free masks, though websites are not tracking current inventory so you’ll want to call the store to confirm their supply before going to get any.\n\nAs for options you can buy right now, the Reviewed team is working hard to carefully vet the PPE products we recommend. As we mentioned, KN95s can be especially hard to buy considering the influx of counterfeit options out there. Reviewed's health and fitness editor, Esther Bell, has ordered KN95 masks from various brands and retailers to better judge the quality and authenticity of the masks. The team will continue to purchase and vet masks, updating the article regularly for new additions.\n\nHere are a few major retailers and trusted online storefronts where you can buy N95 and KN95 masks right now:\n\nProject N95\n\nProject N95 is a non-profit organization that helps to make PPE—like high-filtration masks—accessible to those who need it. The company goes through comprehensive vetting processes to ensure the distribution of legitimate PPE. Assoumou purchases her KN95 masks from Project N95.\n\nBona Fide Masks\n\nThis brand was formed by the long-standing Ball Chain Manufacturing Company, the world's larger manufacturer of ball chain used to crate dog tags and chains for blinds. In 2020, the manufacturing company created Bona Fide Masks in response to the shortage of PPE in 2020.\n\nWe ordered Powecom KN95 masks from Bona Fide Masks ourselves and received what we believe to be authentic KN95s. Some reviews have noted longer-than-usual shipping times for masks bought from Bona Fide Masks, and our order took about two weeks to arrive, which is something to keep in mind if you're looking to acquire masks sooner rather than later.\n\nWellBefore\n\nIf you're looking to purchase a KN95 from WellBefore, Reviewed's health and fitness writer Esther Bell recommends opting for the WellBefore KN95 with adjustable straps to ensure the right fit as the mask without straps may be too large for some faces.\n\nAmazon\n\nLowe's\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nMenard's\n\nHow to tell if an N95 mask is fake\n\nWhen shopping for an N95, the possibility of coming across counterfeit respirator masks is a reality, especially as demand for these masks continues to surge. \"Counterfeit manufacturers are becoming more and more sophisticated,\" says Jim Churchman, vice president, procurement and supply chain, at Duke University Health System. \"As a result, the ability to discern nuances that alert to a product being counterfeit is becoming increasingly difficult.\"\n\nThese masks may look and even feel like N95 masks, but they may not meet the necessary testing and criterion of real N95s. The most important thing to look for to judge authenticity that the respirator has been tested and certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). “Both the mask and its packaging should be labeled \"NIOSH-approved,\" says Dr. Stella Hines, associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nThe CDC says some signs of a counterfeit respirator include \"NIOSH\" being spelled incorrectly or the lack of an approval number on the respirator or headband. In addition, N95s specifically should use headbands, not ear loops—ones with ear loops may be real KN95s or KF94s, but not real N95s. You can double-check to see if a particular N95 brand or model is NIOSH-approved by taking a look at the NIOSH-Certified Equipment List.\n\nFor more tips on spotting a counterfeit mask, read here.\n\nHow to reuse your N95 masks\n\nN95 masks are the optimal choice—but they typically happen to be the most expensive, too. Using masks designed to be disposable like N95s or surgical masks can also feel like a wasteful choice in comparison to a reusable cloth mask. While N95 and KN95 masks are single-use masks, many people have found ways to reuse them effectively.\n\nFor crisis capacity with \"adapting spaces, staff and resources\" such as a shortage of PPE, the CDC approves of strategies like the limited re-use of face masks if necessary. In addition, one study—which, we should note, has not been peer-reviewed—explored how N95 respirators can be reused with a variety of \"cleaning\" strategies, such as rotating multiple masks or exposing them to heat.\n\nYou may also consider rotating N95 masks every couple of days, storing the mask in a breathable paper bag in between uses, a method that many healthcare professionals used when PPE supply was limited. \"For an N95, we'd recommend you switch [the mask] every day,\" says Assoumou. \"But, you can rotate them. If you have three masks, [for example], you could number them and switch them around.\"\n\nKeep in mind that, over time, reusing your mask can begin to degrade its protective qualities over time. Reuse at your discretion and look for any visible signs of mask wear and tear, such as fraying, stretched-out straps or deterioration of the mask itself.\n\nHow to maximize your protection from any mask\n\nWhile N95 respirators are best in class, you can still achieve a level of protection and fit from other masking methods. Mask efficacy greatly depends on factors like the fit on your face, so it's important when you're wearing your mask, you're wearing it correctly.\n\n\"You'll always want to think about fit and filtration,\" says Assoumou. \"You can wear a surgical mask and put a cloth mask over it. This is what the CDC was recommending for a while,\" referring to the CDC's recommendations for double-masking. She explains: \"What the cloth mask does is that it improves the fit—it fits better around your mouth and prevents gaps. That's a problem with a lot of surgical masks—you get the filtration, but there are gaps along the way. That would be the easy way to improve what you're using right now.\"\n\nWhile you can double mask with a cloth mask and surgical mask to add more protective layers and achieve a better fit, that is the only way you should be double-masking. The CDC says to never combine two medical procedure masks—this means no layering of multiple surgical masks. Surgical masks are not designed to fit tightly to begin with, so doubling up on surgical masks won't help to improve the fit.\n\nIn addition, the CDC says you should never combine a KN95 mask with any other mask—this means no layering or double-masking at all when you're wearing a KN95. For N95s, Pierre recommends the same guidance, avoiding any extra layering. \"Doubling up on N95s is not my recommendation—it's already uncomfortable enough and I don't think it's giving you any additional benefits. These are already filtering out 95% or over 95% of those airborne particles if you're wearing a credible N95.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Amanda Tarlton.\n\nThere's a lot more where this came from.Sign up for our weekly newsletter for all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 67% of Americans are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Unfortunately, this may not be enough to hamper the rising cases, as 80% of new cases are due to the BA.5 omicron subvariant, which is highly transmissible and has a notable tendency to get around vaccines at times.\n\nThe CDC continues to recommend masks for people over the age of two in areas of high COVID-19 community levels, if you are sick and around others, or if you have a weakened immune system or are at higher risk. As cases climb, certain municipalities such as Los Angeles are exploring the possibility of re-enforcing mask mandates. However, the situation continues to evolve and masks remain optional for travel, leaving it up to individuals to remain vigilant in protecting themselves and others.\n\nGet deals and shopping advice delivered straight to your phone.Sign up for text message alerts from the experts at Reviewed.\n\nWhen it comes to masking, experts recommend that those who do wear masks upgrade to N95 or KN95 masks, which can filter up to 95% of particles in the air. This recommendation comes after experts discovered cloth masks weren't as effective in protecting against the more contagious variants of COVID-19. While these protective masks are accessible to buy at major retailers and online distributors, there are a lot of fakes out there, especially when it comes to the popular KN95 masks. The CDC estimates that about 60% of KN95 respirators in the U.S. are counterfeit and these fake masks fail to meet the safety standards of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n\nWhen it comes to the health of you and your loved ones, only the real deal will do. Luckily, there are some tells that distinguish the fake masks from the genuine ones out there. Here are a few tips from the CDC and other experts that will help you steer clear of fraudulent N95 and KN95 masks.\n\n►Related: CDC unanimously recommends Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine for adults\n\nHow to tell if an N95 mask is counterfeit\n\nLook for the NIOSH stamp of approval\n\nThe most important thing to look for in N95 masks specifically is that the respirator has been tested and certified by NIOSH. There should be an approval number on the filtering respirator and \"NIOSH\" must be spelled correctly.\n\nBoth the mask and its packaging should be labeled \"NIOSH-approved,\" Dr. Stella Hines, Associate Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, says. \"These masks must meet a specific set of criteria to guarantee that they provide the expected level of protection and performance,\" Dr. Hines explains. \"A formal fit-testing procedure ensures that there is an adequate seal to the face.\"\n\nYou can also reference the manufacturer and approval number from the N95 mask to ensure it's listed on the NIOSH-Certified Equipment List. That way, you can be certain that it meets NIOSH standards.\n\nN95s never have ear loops\n\nLegitimate N95 masks do not have ear loops—they have straps or a headband instead—and no other decorative accents. N95 respirators use headbands that secure around the head to ensure a proper fit to the face.\n\nLook out for the price\n\nJim Churchman, vice president, Procurement and Supply Chain at Duke University Health System recommends keeping an eye out for any N95 masks that are significantly more expensive than the average respirator or ones that are available in suspiciously large quantities. He says that both of these are strong indicators of potential fraud, given that demand is high and that legitimate manufacturers won't charge a premium during a pandemic.\n\nNIOSH-approved N95 kids' masks don't exist\n\nLooking for N95 masks for kids? Unfortunately, N95s are essentially non-existent in kids' sizes due to NIOSH only regulating products for adults, as parenting staff writer Janelle Randazza reports.\n\nWhile an N95 mask might not be an option for your children, protective KN95 or KF94 masks designed for smaller faces or kids are an alternative solution. Many of them are made from the same brands as N95 masks—such as Powecom and WellBefore—and are sold by reputable distributors like Bona Fide Masks and Project N95.\n\nHow to tell if a KN95 mask is counterfeit\n\nKN95s cannot be NIOSH-approved\n\nWhile NIOSH tests and certifies N95 masks, they don't approve KN95 masks, KF94 masks or any other respirator products that may receive international certification. If a retailer or manufacturer claims the KN95 masks are NIOSH-approved, you've most likely encountered a counterfeit product.\n\nLook for the KN95 standard printed on the mask\n\nIn 2020, the FDA granted emergency-use authorization (EUA) for some KN95 masks due to N95 masks supply being scarce. This included respirators and filters certified under China's standards: GB 2626-2006 or the most recent GB 2626-2019. Look for either of these codes printed on the KN95 mask, as this could help identify if a mask is counterfeit or not.\n\nIf it feels questionable, it probably is\n\nWhile sorting through N95 masks is more straightforward, shopping for KN95 masks can be more confusing. If you really aren't sure about any kind of mask from an unknown retailer, ask yourself the questions that you would when encountering other potentially counterfeit products: Is the manufacturer making false claims about certifications? Does the packaging look neat and intact or does it look like it's been tampered with? Are there positive or negative reviews to look into? If something feels questionable, it most likely is.\n\nWhere to buy real N95 and KN95 masks\n\nShopping for N95 or KN95 masks can feel daunting, especially when retailers like Amazon house thousands of unknown brands and manufacturers of N95 and KN95 masks.\n\n“The absence of US government oversight of claims of filtration quality other than for the NIOSH and ASTM authorized coverings has led to widespread confusion about quality,” Project N95 executive director Anne Miller said in a press release from the brand.\n\nOne main method to ensure you're purchasing legitimate respirator masks is by buying from retailers you know and trust. Retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot sell NIOSH-approved N95 masks for many different uses, including for industrial or home improvement needs. Those N95 masks are still certified to provide efficient filtration, so you can buy and use them as needed. You can also find N95 respirators from pharmacies like CVS as well.\n\nIf you're looking for more options for N95 masks or want to try KN95 or KF94 masks, you may want to look to an online distributor that vets personal protective equipment like masks. Places we'd recommend shopping from include Project N95, Bona Fide Masks and WellBefore as they all work to provide affordable, accessible and legitimate PPE to those who need it. Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center, says she uses Project N95 herself.\n\nProject N95\n\nBona Fide Masks\n\nWellBefore\n\nAmazon\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nThere's a lot more where this came from.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get all our reviews, expert advice, deals and more.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Wade ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on June 12, 2022.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday reversed Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old court precedent enshrining a right to abortion.\n\nDoing so now gives state lawmakers the green light to aggressively limit or ban abortion.\n\nSince a draft for Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked last month, CNN readers have asked hundreds of questions about what a reversal of the Supreme Court’s abortion rights precedents would mean and how it will affect access to the procedure. The final decision released Friday closely tracked the leaked draft.\n\nWe’re reading as many questions as we can and answering some of the most popular here.\n\nIs the Supreme Court actually overturning the law or merely saying the decision belongs with each state’s law?\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned previous court precedent that preempted state laws banning abortion before the fetus is viable, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. In overturning the Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood decisions, the Supreme Court allows states to pursue bans and other restrictions on pre-viability abortion.\n\nThe ruling will not have the effect of banning abortion nationwide. According to the logic expressed in the draft decision (and with the caveat that it can still be changed before the final opinion comes out), the question of abortion policy would then go to state and local lawmakers – and potentially federal lawmakers as well.\n\nWill women get arrested for having an abortion if the Supreme Court deems it illegal?\n\nAn abortion-seeker’s criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place.\n\nLeaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldn’t be prosecuted for obtaining abortion, and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that would go into effect with a Roe reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion, but an abortion ban in Wyoming appears to muddle this question with its reference to the “pregnant woman” in the relevant code.\n\nThere’s also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. A state legislator in Louisiana recently proposed a bill that would charge women with murder for obtaining abortion, though that bill failed to advance. Critics of the anti-abortion movement also note that, even with Roe on the books, women have been prosecuted for pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nWhat methods do lawmakers propose to enforce these laws? What can they legally do to find out if someone is pregnant?\n\nThe state abortion prohibitions that will go into effect with the Roe reversal don’t spell out specific enforcement tactics. The lengths local prosecutors will go to enforce abortion restrictions is very much an unanswered question. Before Roe, the aggressiveness of the enforcement of abortion bans often depended on the political environment, including the local environment that prosecutors were navigating. Now, some prosecutors in Democratic-leaning jurisdictions are vowing to not bring criminal charges under abortion restrictions that go into effect with the new Supreme Court opinion.\n\nThe information the prosecutors will seek from health care providers in order to enforce abortion bans IS very much a concern for reproductive rights advocates. HIPAA protections that typically shield an individual’s medical information from disclosure have exemptions for certain law enforcement contexts that may come into play if Roe is overturned. Likewise, there are concerns that the data that can be obtained from an abortion-seeker’s digital devices may be used to determine if she obtained an abortion. That could include information about her menstrual cycle in a period-tracking application, some fear, or search terms she uses for internet searches.\n\nBased on the legal arguments contained in the leaked draft opinion, are there any other legal precedents and SCOTUS opinions that this ruling would overturn beyond Roe v Wade? What further rights and privileges could be at risk of being scaled back if the draft becomes the law of the land?\n\nThe draft Dobbs opinion – if it became the court’s formal ruling – wouldn’t overturn other closely watched precedents in areas like same-sex marriage, contraception and interracial marriage. Those cases, like abortion, are grounded in a right to privacy that is not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, but that the court has said is implied. The Supreme Court, in handing down Roe and its successor Casey, tied the right to an abortion to the precedents in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut and 1967’s Loving v. Virginia, which struck down state restrictions on contraceptives and interracial marriage, respectively. The 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling invalidating Texas’ anti-sodomy law and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide relied on Loving and Griswold as well.\n\nIn the Dobbs draft that leaked, Alito went out of his way in his draft to describe Roe as distinct from those other rulings grounded in a right to privacy because, he wrote, “Abortion destroys…potential life.”\n\n“None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite,” Alito wrote. “They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.”\n\nStill, skeptics see the Roe reversal as opening the door to challenges to those other precedents, with Obergefell being the most vulnerable. Alito himself wrote a dissent to the 2015 ruling that argued that “The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right.”\n\nConservative lawmakers and legal advocates have also argued the court’s Obergefell precedent makes the same errors the court made in enshrining abortion rights.\n\nThe Mississippi law at issue bans abortion starting from 15 weeks after the last menstrual period. If the Supreme Court allows this law to stand, will it then be legal to ban abortion at earlier points in pregnancy? Will it be possible for states to ban medication-induced first-trimester abortions, which are the most common type? Many states seem poised to do so.\n\nIf the draft opinion that was leaked was adopted, not only would the Mississippi 15-week ban be upheld, but states – and potentially the federal government – would be allowed to ban abortion earlier in the pregnancy, including medication-induced first trimester abortions. More than a dozen states have so-called “trigger laws,” under which bans on abortion would be implemented if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and several more have other types of bans that could go into effect with the reversal of previous Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut until the court issues its final opinion, we won’t know for sure how aggressively states will be allowed to restrict abortion under the court’s new precedent.\n\nIn the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy of say 14 years old, where does the law lie for these individuals if Roe vs Wade is overturned?\n\nIf Roe is overturned, exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or health of the mother will vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.\n\nIt’s a question lawmakers will likely revisit once the Supreme Court’s ruling, assuming it overturns Roe, is handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. The six-week ban he signed into law last year – which is currently blocked by court order – included those exemptions.\n\nOn the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.\n\nHow are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?\n\nWhat a Roe reversal would mean for fertility treatments is a major uncertainty.\n\nPhysicians and legal experts in the field are currently grappling with state abortion policies frame their laws around the moment of fertilization, when the egg has united with the sperm. Some of those state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn’t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction, when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to a multiple pregnancy has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how a Roe reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures – which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.\n\nIf the current heavily conservative Supreme Court can overturn Roe v. Wade, that’s been on the books for decades, what’s to stop a future heavily liberal court from overturning this current anti-Roe v. Wade decision in say, 20 years from now?\n\nTechnically, there’s nothing to stop a Supreme Court from revisiting abortion precedent and a court with a more liberal makeup may very well do so. However, one reason that a future liberal Supreme Court majority might be disinclined to change a major precedent again is if those justices feel more loyalty to the principle of stare decisis – the legal principle that discourages overturning precedent unless certain conditions are met – than the loyalty that has been shown by the conservative majority poised to reverse Roe.\n\nThis respect for precedence, for instance, is why Chief Justice John Roberts voted in 2020 to strike down a Louisiana abortion clinic regulation, after he dissented in a 2016 case where the majority struck down a similar Texas law.\n\nCan the right to an abortion be codified by a national vote?\n\nNot directly. A constitutional amendment could be enacted to extend that right. But the process of amending US Constitution begins with a proposal that has the support of either two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or with a convention called for by two-thirds of the states. Ratification of an amendment requires the support of three-fourths of state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions in each state.\n\nWhy does the currently Democrat-controlled legislature not pass a federal law making abortion legal? This would make the SCOTUS decision a non issue.\n\nDemocrats currently lack the votes to dismantle the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote procedural mechanism that Republicans can use to block federal abortion rights legislation – so as long as 40 senators oppose abortion rights. But it’s worth noting that the Women’s Health Protection Act – a bill would codify and expand upon Roe – failed 49-51 when it was voted on in May in the Senate, meaning that, even without the filibuster, it would have not become law.\n\nThere are also legal questions about whether it would be constitutional for federal lawmakers to enact a nationwide ban. The late Justice Antonin Scalia stressed in his legal writings about abortion that the policy-decisions belonged in the hands of individual states, while expressing skepticism that Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the procedure. Friday, Alito used notably open-ended language that doesn’t limit the provenance of abortion legislation to state lawmakers.\n\nCan anti-abortion states prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion in another state? It worries me that states could enact further laws restricting women the choice to leave the state to have an abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion state lawmakers have already expressed interest in regulating conduct around abortion that happens outside of their borders. Perhaps the most aggressive example is a failed bill in Missouri that would have extended its abortion laws to out-of-state abortions if the mother is a Missouri resident or if “Sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.” That proposal hasn’t advanced, but there are other examples of this tactic that might move forward in the future. A handful of Texas lawmakers, for instance, are calling for penalties for companies that cover the costs for employees who travel out of state to obtain abortions.\n\nThe legal authority that state lawmakers have to reach beyond state lines is very much an open question and the topic of a coming law review article that provides more information about the relevant precedents.\n\nIs it possible that women and men who are pro-choice could send abortion pills to women in other states with draconian anti-abortion laws?\n\nWith medication abortion – a two pill regimen that terminates a pregnancy – becoming the method used in a majority of abortions performed nationwide, red states have already been cracking down on the mailing of abortion pills and on administering the pills without an in-person visit with a physician. These state laws started gaining steam after the FDA allowed for the mailing of abortion pills in a pandemic-related move that has now been made permanent. If Roe is overturned, medication abortion will be covered by abortion bans and we might see other types of proposals to limit medication abortion.\n\nBut how to enforce these restrictions on mailing abortion pills is another question anti-abortion lawmakers are still working through. Texas last year updated its previously existing ban on mailing abortion pills to make it the type of crime that would warrant extradition. Blue states have countered with measures that would prohibit their state authorities from cooperating with such extradition requests.\n\nThere are also international sources from which women in anti-abortion states may seek delivery of medication abortion.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/abortion-ruling-gay-rights-contraceptives/index.html", "title": "Abortion decision could open the door to overturn same-sex ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court’s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade on Friday could open the door for courts to overturn same-sex marriage, contraception and other rights.\n\nIt’s already set off a debate among justices over whether overturning Roe puts those precedents in danger.\n\nThe majority opinion from Justice Samuel Alito attempted to wall off its holding in Friday’s abortion case from those other rulings, but Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to call explicitly for those other rulings to be revisited.\n\n“In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” Thomas wrote, referring to decisions on contraception, sodomy and same-sex marriage.\n\nLiberals said that those rulings are now at risk.\n\nIn their dissent, the liberal justices wrote “no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work.”\n\n“The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone,” they wrote. “To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage.”\n\nThe liberals added: “Either the mass of the majority’s opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear these anonymous CNN viewers share their personal stories and opinions of abortion 04:10 - Source: CNN\n\nAlito, in a new section of the opinion that was not present in the leaked draft, responded to the dissenters’ warnings.\n\nHe emphasized a line the majority opinion that said “[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.”\n\n“We have also explained why that is so: rights regarding contraception and same-sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey termed ‘potential life,’” Alito said.\n\nAlito’s assertions were undercut by a concurrence by Thomas, who explicitly called for the court to reconsider its rulings striking down state restrictions on contraceptives, state sodomy bans and state prohibitions on same-sex marriage.\n\n“Because any substantive due process decision is ‘demonstrably erroneous,’” Thomas wrote, “we have a duty to ‘correct the error’ established in those precedents.”\n\nThe liberal dissenters used Thomas’ concurrence to go after Alito’s assurances that the court was not putting those precedents at risks by overturning Roe.\n\n“The first problem with the majority’s account comes from JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence — which makes clear he is not with the program. In saying that nothing in today’s opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, JUSTICE THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue,” the liberals wrote, as they quoted from Thomas’ concurrence.\n\n“So at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of today’s decision again and again and again,” they said.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/abortion-laws-red-states-republicans/index.html", "title": "Why the Republican offensive on abortion is escalating | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen three red states finalized severe restrictions on abortion over consecutive days last week, they highlighted the GOP’s rising militancy on the issue – and the political and legal calculations underpinning it.\n\nSeparate actions last week in Oklahoma, Florida and Kentucky made clear the red state drive to retrench, or eliminate, access to abortion is escalating as the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority nears a decision, expected in late June, in which it is widely anticipated to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.\n\nThe abortion restrictions these states approved last week all denied exceptions for victims of rape or incest – a provision that was once a common feature of conservative anti-abortion proposals but has been jettisoned almost completely in the wave of new restrictions approved since 2021. The Oklahoma legislation banned nearly all abortions from the moment of conception and imposed severe penalties on doctors who perform them, including up to 10 years in jail. The Kentucky bill, continuing an offensive already underway in several other red states, prohibited state residents from obtaining medication abortion through the mail, as the federal Food and Drug Administration authorized late last year.\n\nTaken together, the sweeping bills finalized last week show how the sympathetic signals from the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority are changing the strategy of red states. In earlier legislative sessions, Republican-controlled states generally had either passed abortion restrictions designed to provide a test case the Supreme Court could use to overturn Roe or had approved bills crafted narrowly enough that they hoped they could survive legal challenges while Roe remained the law, says Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who studies the history of abortion law.\n\nWe are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe. Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective. Mary Ziegler, Florida State University law professor\n\nBut after former President Donald Trump’s appointments of Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett established a clear conservative majority on the court – and particularly since that majority signaled during last year’s hearing on a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban that it is inclined to retrench or entirely scrap Roe – the red states are removing the veils to more clearly indicate where they will take the law if the court allows them.\n\n“We are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe,” Ziegler told me in an email. “Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective.”\n\nAll of this is coming even as a January CNN survey conducted by SSRS found that more than two-thirds of Americans oppose the court overturning Roe v. Wade. Abortion restrictions routinely draw broader support in red states, but even in them, a 2018 state-level analysis by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute shared with CNN found that in most cases, a majority of residents do not want to completely ban abortion – despite the fact that several states have passed “trigger” bans to do so if the Supreme Court allows it.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the severe abortion restrictions rapidly proliferating in red states represent a bet from the Republicans controlling them that they can satisfy the demands of their most ardent base supporters without facing any consequences among more centrist voters in their coalition who are uneasy, or outright opposed, to the new limits. Across the red states, Republicans are placing a similar wager on the broad wave of other bills they have approved in rapid-fire succession since 2020 to limit transgender rights, censor classroom discussion of race, gender and sexual orientation and ban certain books.\n\nIf that bet pays off, and red state Republicans suffer no midterm defections over this surge of socially conservative legislation – an outcome that may be the most likely possibility amid the extensive public discontent over President Joe Biden’s performance – pressure inside the party to lurch policy further to the right will only intensify, not only on abortion, but also on the broad range of cultural issues energizing conservative activists.\n\nA rising tide of legislation\n\nEven amid the increasing red-state focus on the issue since 2021, last week’s activity constituted a kind of crescendo. On Tuesday, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed one of the nation’s most sweeping bans, which bars almost all abortions, denies exceptions for rape and incest and imposes felony penalties, including up to 10 years in prison, on doctors who perform or attempt to perform the procedure. On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled Kentucky state legislature overrode a veto from the state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, to approve legislation that bans abortion after 15 weeks also without exceptions for rape and incest, prohibits the distribution of abortion pills through the mail and imposes so many restrictions on abortion clinics that neither of Kentucky’s two facilities is expected to continue operating in the state. Then on Thursday, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law that state’s 15-week abortion ban, which also contains no exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nThese hardline bills continue the clear pattern of the past two years. Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank supporting reproductive rights, says that since 2021, 12 Republican-controlled states have passed laws restricting or banning abortion. Of those, she says, only the new limits approved in Idaho, South Carolina and Wyoming preserve some exemptions for victims of rape and incest.\n\nThe removal of exceptions for rape and incest in the new state laws represents only one of the ways in which red states are escalating their campaign against abortion. Since 2021, seven Republican-controlled states have banned distribution of medication abortion through the mail, despite the FDA ruling. Texas, in another case that’s reached the Supreme Court, last year created a “vigilante” lawsuit system that authorizes private litigation against anyone who assists or provides an abortion (although not the woman herself) after cardiac activity can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Idaho has incorporated a similar approach into its “heartbeat” abortion ban as well.\n\nIt is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue. That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics. Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN\n\nMore states may follow before this legislative season ends. Republican-controlled legislatures in Ohio and Louisiana may advance new abortion bans, with further action under discussion but less likely in Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, Nash says. Separately, Missouri, Tennessee and Ohio may bar residents from obtaining medication abortion solely through the mail. Oklahoma could also supplement the ban Stitt signed last week with several additional measures, including a bill authorizing Texas-style private lawsuits (which are also under discussion, if less imminently, in Ohio and Louisiana).\n\nRed states are also discussing ways to extend the reach of their restrictions beyond their borders. A Republican state legislator in Missouri has proposed to authorize lawsuits against people in other states who help a state resident obtain an abortion. After Citibank indicated it would pay expenses for Texas employees who traveled out of state to obtain abortions, a Republican Texas state legislator last month threatened to introduce legislation barring companies that did so from local government contracts.\n\nThis increasingly confrontational posture toward abortion in red states tracks with the GOP’s trajectory on other social issues. Republican-controlled states have also moved toward more militant positions on LGBTQ issues, not only banning transgender women and girls from school sports, but also initiating child abuse investigations against parents (Texas) and criminal penalties against medical professionals (Alabama) who provide gender-affirming treatment for transgender minors. A broad red-state push to limit how race and gender are discussed in public school classrooms has spilled over to new measures to restrict how teachers talk about sexual identity and orientation (such as the Florida legislation critics call the “don’t say gay” bill, which DeSantis recently signed into law), and proposals to make it easier to ban books they don’t approve of not only in school libraries, but also in public ones.\n\nDemocrats struggling to respond\n\nOn every front, ideas that once might have been considered on the fringe inside the GOP have moved rapidly into law – and, in most instances, inspired copy-cat proposals in other states. Democrats have struggled to respond to this offensive, both at the state and national level. In Washington, the House of Representatives has passed legislation that would codify a national right to abortion and undo many states’ moves against transgender youth, but Republican-led filibusters have blocked those proposals in the Senate (along with the House-passed bill that would override the voting restrictions many of these same red states have approved). And though state Democrats have voted almost en masse against these policies, as well as the voting restrictions, the party has been divided over how much to stress its opposition to them in the midterm elections – frustrating some party strategists in the process.\n\n“It is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue,” says Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a Democratic research and advocacy group. “That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics.”\n\nOf all the socially conservative causes Republicans are advancing in the red states, abortion is probably the issue Democrats feel most comfortable contesting. As CNN recently reported, with the Supreme Court decision approaching, a wide array of Democratic candidates are stressing their commitment to preserving abortion rights.\n\n“I do think they are overplaying their hand electorally, because November could be the first election we’ve had in decades when Roe is not the law of the land, and I think the backlash will be very swift and severe,” says Christina Polizzi, press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nPolls have consistently found that a solid majority of Americans oppose overturning Roe – with that resistance extending well into the Republican coalition. In the January CNN survey, not only did 69% of all adults oppose ending the constitutional right to abortion, so did 43% of Republican men and a striking 47% of Republican women, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling team. In a follow-up question, nearly three-fifths of all adults said that if the Supreme Court did overturn Roe, they wanted their states to make their abortion laws more permissive, while only 40% wanted them more restrictive. About one-third of both Republican men and women joined the majority who preferred that state laws become more permissive.\n\nSupport for abortion restrictions, not surprisingly, is greater in red-leaning states, whose populations typically include more of the White evangelical Christians who compose the core of the social conservative movement. When the Public Religion Research Institute tabulated state-by-state abortion attitudes in a massive 2018 poll, it found that majorities in Mississippi, Idaho and Arkansas – states that have imposed some of the latest restrictions – said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to results provided by the institute’s research director, Natalie Jackson. But clear majorities said it should be legal in all or most cases in Florida and Arizona, where Republicans have passed new restrictions, and slight pluralities echoed that position in Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma – three other states where Republican officials have voted to limit access.\n\nMore recent surveys have also found unease with the restrictions. Nearly 3 in 5 Florida voters opposed the state’s 15-week abortion ban in a University of North Florida poll earlier this year. (Half of those polled were told that the bill offered no exceptions for rape and incest – and only 51% of even Republican voters who were given that information backed the ban.)\n\nIn Texas, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey has found state residents split almost exactly in half over the fetal heartbeat abortion ban but a clear majority opposed to the separate “trigger” bill the legislature approved to ban all abortions if the Supreme Court allows it. Other UT polls have found that fewer than about 1 in 8 Texas residents want to ban abortion without those exceptions for rape, incest and the woman’s health, and a solid majority oppose the legislation authorizing private lawsuits against those involved in providing abortions. That opposition encompassed a significant portion of Republicans: two-fifths of Republican women and about one-third of Republican men said they opposed the absolute “trigger” ban and about one-third of Republicans opposed the private lawsuit bill.\n\nVoters’ reactions may be crucial\n\nThe future of the anti-abortion drive in red states – and the broader movement to roll back civil rights and liberties there – will likely pivot on how the Republican voters uneasy with these proposals respond to them. These polls show that in theory the sharp right turn on abortion and other social issues from red-state Republicans could fracture the electoral coalition that now allows them to dominate these states.\n\nBut in practice, many observers believe, Democrats face significant obstacles to peeling away many Republican-leaning voters unhappy over these issues, in the near term at least.\n\n“That 40% of Republican women may oppose banning abortion,” says James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, “but in a campaign situation” Republicans can overcome that hesitance by shifting those voters’ focus toward other issues where they disagree with Democrats.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, he says, the GOP’s odds of holding those voters are magnified by a midterm environment in which ordinarily Republican-leaning voters have so many objections to the performance of Biden and other Democrats, from inflation to immigration. “The environment shapes what you can get leverage on and what people will respond to, and it’s a very noisy environment right now,” Henson says.\n\nRed state Republicans broadly share that confidence. As Matt Mackowiak, an Austin-based GOP strategist, told me earlier this year, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s priorities.” Rather than losing suburban support over the right’s turn on abortion and other social issues, he predicted the Republican vote share will rise “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.” Republican Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas and DeSantis in Florida, who have pushed some of the most aggressive social conservative agendas, are considered strong favorites for reelection in November, and Tennessee GOP Gov. Bill Lee, who has matched them step for step, does not even have a serious Democratic opponent.\n\nTresa Undem, a Democratic pollster who focuses on issues relating to gender equality and politics, agrees that few Republican women who support abortion rights are likely to defect from the party coalition if the court overturns Roe. Her extensive surveys have found that the vast majority of them still share the broader unease with cultural change in American society that has energized the GOP coalition in the Trump era. “Republican women don’t vote on” abortion, she says.\n\nBut Undem thinks the situation could be very different among women who identify as independents. That’s especially likely, she thinks, if the Supreme Court’s ruling so unambiguously rescinds Roe that it generates sustained media coverage.\n\n“I think if it’s outright overturned, and this breaks through, people learn about, it will definitely affect independent women,” she says. “I keep going back in my mind to Texas. I was stunned; we did a focus group of independent women and they said things I have never heard. At least half the women said something like this: ‘I have never even really cared who the governor was of Texas, but my skin crawls thinking about the issue of (the private lawsuits Texas authorized against abortion providers).’ It’s the signal of all that other power and control that they think politicians have over their lives.”\n\nThe January CNN survey underscores that possibility: Fully three-fourths of women who identified as independents said they opposed overturning Roe. Yet with so many other challenges at this tumultuous moment in American life shaping voters’ attitudes, it’s far from clear that those concerns will translate into votes against the Republicans advancing those laws. Even many voters opposed to the abortion restrictions, Undem acknowledges, may calculate, “I don’t think I am going to need an abortion, but I am filling up my (gas) tank right now.”\n\nDani Thayer, left, and Marina Lanae, both of Tulsa, Oklahoma, protest at the state Capitol, Wednesday, April 13, 2022, in Oklahoma City. Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nThe safest prediction may be that if Republican governors and state legislatures run well this November in the states moving so sharply to the right on abortion and other cultural issues, they will be emboldened to continue pushing the frontier of such legislation.\n\nThere are no signs the current round of targets represents the outer boundary of ambition for the social conservative movement or the red-state Republican officials responding to it. During the recent confirmation hearings for incoming Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, three Republican senators suggested the court had erred in previous decisions that prevented states from barring the sale of contraceptives or blocking interracial and same-sex marriages. The total abortion bans, prohibition on mail distribution of medication abortion, discussion of extending private lawsuits across state lines and punishment of companies that help employees obtain abortions outside states that are prohibiting them signal where red states may move next on that front.\n\nAll of which suggests that if voters don’t send a cautionary signal in November, the red-state drive may be just beginning to roll back the “rights revolution” of the past six decades – and return the US to a pre-1960s world in which people’s basic civil rights and liberties varied much more depending on where they lived.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/06/24/plan-b-what-you-need-know/7567434001/", "title": "Can you still buy Plan B? What to know after SCOTUS overturns Roe", "text": "If you've had unprotected sex and don't want to become pregnant, you may be looking for emergency contraception. The \"morning-after pill\" is a safe and effective option.\n\nLevonorgestrel morning-after pills, like Plan B, are arguably the most well-known emergency contraceptives. Other options include the Ella pill and the copper intrauterine device, more widely known as an IUD.\n\nThese emergency contraceptives \"won't have an impact on an existing pregnancy, they prevent a pregnancy from occurring,\" Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic in New York, told USA TODAY.\n\nPlan B and other levonorgestrel pills can often be the easiest to access – as you can buy them at local drug stores or online without a prescription.\n\nStill, challenges in accessing this kind of emergency contraception continue – and the barriers aren't equal for everyone. Plan B's $40 to $50 price tag is unaffordable for many. Conscience clauses in some states allow pharmacists to refuse selling the pill. And, for people over 165 pounds, levonorgestrel can be less effective.\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court's Friday decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion, people across the U.S. can still buy and access emergency contraception like morning-after pills. But many fear what the reversal of the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade case could mean for other rights protected under the right to privacy, including contraception as a whole.\n\nAbortion laws by state:Searchable database\n\nRoe v. Wade overturned:Supreme Court ruling triggers maze of state abortion laws\n\nWhere can you get Plan B? How effective is it? What's the future of contraception access now that Roe is reversed? Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat is Plan B?\n\nA morning-after pill is oral emergency contraception that you can take up to five days after unprotected sex (including if your method of birth control failed, such as a ripped condom or missing a birth control pill) to reduce the risk of pregnancy.\n\nThere are two types of morning-after pills: levonorgestrel pills and the ulipristal acetate-based Ella pill. Plan B One-Step, or Plan B, is arguably the most well-known levonorgestrel pill in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, taking a levonorgestrel morning-after pill within three days of unprotected sex can lower your chance of getting pregnant by 75%-89%. In addition to Plan B One-Step, common brands include Take Action, Preventeza, AfterPill, Aftera, My Choice, My Way, Option 2 and EContra One-Step.\n\nWhere can I get Plan B? Is it only over the counter?\n\nYou can get Plan B or other levonorgestrel pills at your local drug store or pharmacy. You can also order some levonorgestrel pills online, if time allows, or try going to a nearby family planning clinic or health center.\n\nLevonorgestrel can be purchased over the counter without a prescription in the U.S. It's often locked or kept behind the counter, so you may have to ask a pharmacist or store clerk for assistance.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nHow can I get Plan B for free? Is it covered by insurance?\n\nThe price of Plan B typically ranges from $40 to $50, but you can order some generic brands for less. The brand shouldn't matter – Planned Parenthood notes that all brand-name and generic levonorgestrel morning-after pills are equally effective.\n\nStill, \"cost is the big barrier,\" Shah said, adding that it's important to know options to help with the price if needed.\n\nHealth insurance may aid with the cost. You can get morning-after pills for free with many insurance plans, including Medicaid in some states. But if you're using insurance, it's important to note that you will need a prescription by a doctor or nurse so that the pill will be covered. Call your provider to confirm.\n\nSome health centers, including Planned Parenthood, also offer morning-after pills for free or at lower costs.\n\nShah recommends buying one or two morning-after pills or getting a prescription in advance, that way you are prepared when you need it. Still, it's important to note that these pills can expire, so check the information on the side of the box.\n\nDo I need to be 18 to buy Plan B? What are conscience clauses?\n\nNo. You should be able to buy Plan B and other levonorgestrel morning-after pills no matter what age you are.\n\nHowever, some state laws can cause barriers to access. \"Conscience clauses,\" for example, give pharmacists and other health care providers the right to refuse to fill emergency contraception and contraception prescriptions if it violates their religious or personal beliefs.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, conscience clauses were first enacted across numerous states in response to the landmark Roe decision, allowing physicians to refuse to perform an abortion and hospitals to ban abortions performed on their premises. Protections for refusing to distribute emergency contraception, including morning-after pills, soon followed.\n\nConscience clause legislation can vary between states, but some states with these kinds of protection include South Dakota, Idaho, Arizona and Texas.\n\nHow soon should you take Plan B? How does the pill work?\n\nDespite the name, you don't have to take a morning-after pill the morning directly after having unprotected sex. You can take Plan B and other levonorgestrel pills up to five days after, but the sooner the better. Planned Parenthood notes that it works best to take a levonorgestrel pill within three days of unprotected sex.\n\nIn basic terms, a levonorgestrel morning-after pill is a hormone-based contraceptive that prevents or delays ovulation, which is when an egg is released from the ovary. It's like a highly-concentrated birth control pill, Dr. Mary Jacobson, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at Alpha Medical, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nThe pill is very safe, but there can be some mild side effects. According to the Mayo Clinic, side effects can include nausea, fatigue, headache, bleeding between periods, or heavier menstrual bleeding.\n\nMore:What to know about birth control as Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade\n\nYou cannot take Plan B too much, Shah notes, because it will just continue to delay ovulation. Planned Parenthood says it's \"totally safe to take the morning-after pill as many times as you need to\" – but adds that it might not be the best form of go-to contraception in the long term due to the financial cost, some of the side effects and because other types of birth control (such as condoms and the IUD) may be a better fit.\n\nMale birth control:What's getting in the way, sexism or science?\n\nMorning-after pills like Plan B are \"a great form of contraception,\" Shah said. \"What I tell people though, is that if you're finding that you're using it so often, it may be a good idea to think about something that is more consistent just in terms of lifestyle.\"\n\nIs Plan B effective for people over 165 pounds?\n\nUnfortunately, it's important to note that Plan B isn't equally effective for everyone – further limiting options for many in accessing emergency contraception. According to Planned Parenthood, levonorgestrel pills may not work for people who weigh 165 pounds or more.\n\nIf you weigh more than 165 pounds, a morning-after pill containing ulipristal acetate, or Ella, may be best for you. However, unlike levonorgestrel morning-after pills, you will need a prescription to buy Ella.\n\nElla can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 85% if taken within five days after unprotected sex (the sooner the better, like Plan B), Planned Parenthood says. If you've already taken Ella but later need emergency contraception again for unprotected sex in the following five days, you will need to take Ella again – not a levonorgestrel pill. Levonorgestrel is a type of progestin (similar to what is used in birth control pills), whereas Ella is a progestin blocker.\n\n\"What you shouldn't do is combine Plan B and Ella,\" Shah said. \"They have opposite methods of action, so they can, in theory, negate each other.\"\n\nIf you weigh 195 pounds or more, Ella still might not be as effective, according to Planned Parenthood. A copper IUD, which can be used as another form of emergency contraception if inserted up to five days after unprotected sex, may be a better option. Talk to your doctor about what is best for you.\n\nCould the end of Roe v. Wade impact access to emergency contraception?\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court overturned Roe, the 1973 landmark case that constitutionally established the federal right to abortion, in its closely-watched Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling.\n\nThe reversal could cause 26 states to ban abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Thirteen of these states have \"trigger laws,\" which are now set to go into effect automatically or through a quick state action because Roe no longer applies.\n\nMore:Supreme Court ruling triggers maze of state abortion laws\n\nThe Supreme Court's reversal of Roe could eventually have impacts beyond abortion rights, experts warn. Roe established the right to abortion under the right to privacy, bringing into question what the reversal could mean for other landmark rulings that also used the right to privacy – including same-sex marriage, interracial marriage and, again, contraception.\n\nIn a concurring opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, he noted that cases including Griswold v. Connecticut (which established the right for married people to obtain contraceptives), Lawrence v. Texas (which established the right to private, consensual sexual acts) and Obergefell v. Hodges (which established the right to same-sex marriage) \"are not at issue\" right now.\n\nHowever, Thomas wrote, \"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.\"\n\nPeople across the U.S. can still buy and access emergency contraception like morning-after pills – but many worry that abortion bans and restrictions could trickle down to other forms of contraception in the future.\n\nFact check:Plan B still legal in Missouri as Supreme Court considers fate of Roe v. Wade\n\nThe right to privacy \"comes from a number of different areas within the Constitution itself, but it evolved out of a right to contraception access. And from that we got a whole slew of sexual privacy rights,\" Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University College of Law, told USA TODAY in May, following the leak of the court's draft Dobbs opinion. \"So, if you unravel one string in that fabric of doctrine, it could potentially unravel the other rights or at least open them up to greater attack.\"\n\nRoe reversal:From LGBTQ rights to interracial marriage, abortion ruling could be map for GOP's next push\n\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez, Bill Keveney, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/opinions/marriage-equality-roe-racism-supreme-court-lester/index.html", "title": "Opinion: I will never live in the marital shadows again | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Joan Steinau Lester is the author of six books, most recently “Loving Before Loving: A Marriage in Black and White.” The opinions in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn 1981, long before the legalization of same-sex marriage, I committed to living for the rest of my life with Carole, the woman I loved. But when Carole and I introduced each other to friends, we had no language to describe our relationship.\n\nIf I referred to her as my “partner,” many assumed business partner. “Lover” felt too intimate, “life-partner” too clunky, “special friend” an abhorred remnant of a closeted era.\n\ncourtesy Irene Young\n\n“Wife” would have made our relationship absolutely clear, but it was a word denied to us at the time.\n\nThe penalties for this extra-legal union were severe: Carole’s adored father, who was Catholic, refused to speak to her because of his faith-based objections. We both faced potential job losses if found out. Carole, working for the federal government, had to maintain an especially low profile since we’d heard of lesbians being fired once they were “discovered.”\n\nEven my children and I were jeopardized. Fortunately, no relative sued for custody in a period when lesbian mothers were habitually deemed “unfit” for parenting.\n\nEventually, Carole and I bought a house together and combined our finances. Yet our accountant had to artificially untangle our taxes every year to file “single” returns.\n\nIt took a Supreme Court decision, Obergefell in 2015, to nationally recognize this same-sex marriage. When we heard the news, tears of joy and incredulity streamed down our cheeks. But also, a feeling of security washed over me. Nobody could take my wife away from me now. We were safe.\n\nIt was a feeling that was already familiar, since I’d experienced it years earlier with the Supreme Court’s Loving v. Virginia decision. That’s because my relationship with Carole was in fact, the second time my most intimate bond had been outlawed. It was also the second time that it took a sweeping Supreme Court action to grant me the freedom to love whomever I wanted.\n\nIn 1962, I’d married a Black man, and because I am considered White, our union was one that 21 states then considered illegal.\n\nIn our dingy Manhattan basement apartment, the legal status mattered little. But as civil rights activists longing to travel South for voter-registration drives, we were deterred by their anti-miscegenation laws. When my husband Julius joined SNCC, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in Mississippi – where we’d risk immediate arrest or worse – I had to stay in New York.\n\nEven in Manhattan, the racism was intense: our landlady who lived upstairs yelled racial slurs at Julius whenever she saw him. For five years we endured her vile harangues, shouted from a second-story window each time he entered or left the building.\n\nBut in 1967, the atmosphere changed noticeably with the Loving ruling, when the Supreme Court affirmed everyone’s right to marry their (opposite-sex) partner of choice – regardless of their so-called “race.” Finally, our marriage – from which both sets of parents had withheld their approval — was legal across the United States.\n\nThe ruling conferred a social legitimacy as well as legal one: White strangers who had felt free to grill me in public about our children, asking, “How did they get so tan?” curtailed their questions. Loving normalized us. When diners in restaurants stared at our unusual family composition (interracial unions were just 3% of marriages in 1967), I began to stare back.\n\nOver time, the social pressure took its toll. Among my few interracially coupled friends, no couple survived the decade. After eight years, our marriage also dissolved.\n\nAs improbable as a return to pre-Loving or pre-Obergefell days may sound, we see the torment this Supreme Court has just inflicted on girls and women in no-abortion states. Not only are they denied decision-making over their bodies, but those who miscarry risk dying when doctors can’t legally treat them. Given this cruelty, no draconian legal ruling seems implausible.\n\nWith legal marriage, Carole and I gained 1,138 federal rights and protections, including, significantly, hospital visitation. What if one of us landed in the hospital, we’d worried, and the other – not considered next of kin – was refused visits? We wouldn’t be able to make health care decisions for each other. The prospect had filled us with fear.\n\nFollowing Obergefell, I underwent a series of surgeries. Whenever I lay in the hospital for a week at a time, we were grateful Carole could stay with me, no questions asked. No one refuses a wife. Her presence, as well as her daily advocacy, helped me survive. Where would we be if she hadn’t been allowed this privilege?\n\nMore recently, as friends with Covid have entered ICUs, we’ve noticed that hospitals only grant those few precious minutes of visitation to close family members. Each time, we’re grateful for our married status.\n\nIf the Supreme Court repeals Obergefell, which relied heavily on Loving as the basis for freedom to choose a marriage partner, I dread a return to legal limbo. What would happen to our marriage, after Carole’s and my 41 years together?\n\nWe could end our lives like the “spinster roommates” of yore, subject to the whims of the other’s biological family. Legally they could be entitled to make all decisions about our beloved if she were incapacitated – and possibly our own futures if, for instance, they demanded a sale of our home.\n\nAfter all, if as the justices ruled, abortion is not a right because it is not “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” not written in the Constitution, then all of our other unwritten rights are at risk too, including the right to decide who we choose to marry – including when that person is of the same gender. Or a different race.\n\nIn fact, Justice Clarence Thomas in his concurring opinion overturning Roe, indicated that not only was the right to abortion not a form of “liberty” protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, but that other rulings that relied on the same reasoning could be revisited.\n\nHe cited three landmark cases: Griswold v. Connecticut, that found that married couples had a right to contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, a 2003 case invalidating sodomy laws that had made homosexual relations a crime; and Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nHe specifically did not mention Loving, although one US senator did – telling reporters after the Court invalidated Roe that he supported allowing the states to decide on the legality of interracial marriage. (He later retracted those remarks, saying that he’d misunderstood the question.) There is no small number of legal observers who has said that the landmark 1967 ruling could be at risk, if the court applies the same reasoning to interracial marriage that was used in the abortion ruling.\n\nIf the Court were to overturn Loving, what could happen to my biracial son’s interracial marriage? Are we going to recreate a labyrinthine system of octoroons and quadroons, based on an illusory percent of “colored blood”? Who could my three biracial grandchildren legally marry?\n\nThankfully, we have a legacy in this country of citizens rising to the moment. Last month, voters in socially conservative Kansas upheld their “Free State” nickname, earned when they entered the Union in 1861 as a free, rather than slave state. By a margin of 18 percentage points, they affirmed their state constitution’s abortion rights, and gave us all a roadmap to protection.\n\nThe vast numbers of us in same-sex and/or interracial marriages, supported by our allies, need to speak up. We can preempt any further Supreme Court madness by demanding our state legislators immediately add protection for interracial and same-sex marriages to our constitutions.\n\nThere is even some hope that our federal lawmakers may take action: Democrats in Congress recently proposed and passed, with the support of 47 Republicans, the Respect for Marriage Act – which provides “statutory authority for same sex and interracial marriages” specifically citing in its text the Obergefell and Loving decisions.\n\nThe measure would protect against such regression. But passage in the Senate is far from assured. As Loving affirmed, we need to secure our personal right to choose the people we love without interference.\n\nDuring the complicated years of 2008-2015 when Carole and I were legally married in California but not recognized nationally, we traveled with our marriage certificate in our suitcases. Once we flashed it at a New York car rental clerk who had refused us a spousal second-driver benefit (It worked).\n\nMostly, however, we carried it for more dire situations when we needed to prove our legal bond. Although such a patchwork of marriage affirming states might be difficult to navigate, if Congress fails to pass the bill, sanctuary states might be our best option.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 9th of December 2022. Today...\n\nPresident Joe Biden:\n\nShe's safe. She's on a plane. She's on her way home.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBrittney Griner has been released from Russian custody. Plus, did Iran really disband its so-called morality police, and we check in with the US housing market.\n\n♦\n\nWNBA star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian penal colony and is headed home to the United States. The move comes after a prisoner exchange with the US sending Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout back to Russia. Griner has been in Russian custody since February after police said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage. So how did the US bring Brittney home? For more on that, I'm now joined by USA TODAY Sports reporter Chris Bumbaca. Chris, thanks for being here.\n\nChris Bumbaca:\n\nThanks so much for having me on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Chris, how did Brittney's release happen?\n\nChris Bumbaca:\n\nSo Brittney Griner came home via a prisoner swap with Russia. The US exchanged notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was scheduled to be in US custody through 2029. He's going back now and has received clemency. And that's how Griner's coming home. It was always going to be a prisoner swap pretty much from the time she was detained back in February.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCherelle Griner, Brittney's wife, has been a huge part of efforts all year to bring her love home. Can you talk about Cherelle's role in all of this, Chris?\n\nChris Bumbaca:\n\nIt was certainly an impressive effort that you touched on. Today from the White House she said, \"Today, my family is whole.\" And I think that was her goal all along, was to put her family back together and she did it the only way she knew how. She has a law degree and used those resources and skills to leverage relationship, gain an audience with President Biden and senior administration officials who were able to ultimately negotiate this deal to bring her wife home.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Chris, what does this mean for Paul Whelan? This is the American who's been detained in Russia since 2018 and his name has often been linked with Brittney's as part of a possible prisoner swap. So what's next for him now?\n\nChris Bumbaca:\n\nPart of what Cherelle said from the White House today was that she and Brittney would remain committed to bringing home wrongfully detained Americans who suffer the same plight that their family endures every single day. I've had a chance with some of these families through my coverage of this story, and they are normal Americans just like you and me who have to confront this nightmare every single day that someone that they love is abroad for reasons that are illegitimate. So what's next for Paul Whelan is that he remains in jail and senior administration officials told him yesterday about the exchange. Today, to CNN, he expressed bewilderment as to why he still remains there. But it's pretty clear that the Russians value him more because he has an espionage charge that is part of his 16-year sentence. Paul Whelan is going on four years detained in Russia. And today on CNN, his brother David, who I've gotten to know pretty well, says that he's happy for Brittney Griner and wants to experience that same joy one day for his family.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, USA TODAY Sports reporter, Chris Bumbaca. Thanks for making the time.\n\nChris Bumbaca:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can read more about Brittney Griner's release in the USA TODAY'S sports section online and in print.\n\n♦\n\nProtests in Iran have persisted for nearly three months, and there were reports this week that the country's so-called morality police would be dismantled. That's after some confusing comments by a senior Iranian official. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY World Affairs correspondent Kim Hjelmgaard to find out more.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nWell first off, who are the morality police in Iran and what exactly do they do?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nYeah, so the morality police is kind of like slang that we hear in the West use to refer to a program that is run through the police in Iran. They essentially kind of monitor social behavior, in particular the way men and women dress and interact with one another in accordance with Iran's interpretation of Islamic law. As these things do, it mostly affects women and particular head and neck covering.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nWhy was there this confusion about possibly disbanding them?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nI think it was a combination of a confused statement out of the mouth of an Iranian official and then people looking at this statement in light of what's been happening there the last few months, and then sort of drawing a conclusion about that statement. But the other thing to bear in mind here, the deeper context is that the morality police, they issue... When I was in Iran, you see them, they drive around town in distinctive green and white vans. They issue fines, they give warnings, they can detain people, but they have not actually been involved in policing these protests at all.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nIs there a sense that Iran is starting to become a little more progressive than what they've then been known for?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nI mean, I think we need to draw distinction between the government and the people. My experience of Iranians is that they are progressive. The Iranian people that you meet. And certainly the diaspora that you find in the US and Europe is a whole different kettle of fish. But inside Iran, people are far more modern and you use all the social media apps that we do, are interested in popular music and popular culture. The government, that's a whole other scenario. It wasn't too long ago that they elected a new president who's in the grand scheme of things, kind of viewed as somewhat more hard line than the previous one. One of the misconceptions about Iran is that there's quite a thriving political scene domestically, and they do have debate with different shades of gray in terms of political opinions. That doesn't mean that it necessarily goes anywhere, but the country is still old, domestic, and foreign policy is still more or less determined by the supreme leader. But nevertheless, once you go underneath that, there is some limited scope for discussion about topics. And I think that surprises many people.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump does not plan to appeal a court order that put an end to the special master review of documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate, according to CNN. That comes after a federal appeals court ruled last week that a lower court should not have appointed a third party to review classified documents found at his home in August. Trump's legal team had previously argued that they needed an outside expert to decide whether any of the documents could be privileged. The appeals court went at the idea that Trump deserves special treatment because he's a former president. The court wrote, \"It is indeed extraordinary for a warrant to be executed at the home of a former president, but not in a way that affects our legal analysis or otherwise gives the judiciary license to interfere in an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe end to the special master's review comes as more classified material was found at a storage unit linked to former President Trump and as the Justice Department has asked a federal judge to hold Trump's office in contempt of court for failing to fully comply with a subpoena to return all classified documents in his possession.\n\n♦\n\nThe House Oversight Committee slammed the NFL and the Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder after an investigation into the football team's toxic work culture. The Democrat-led committee found that the team and league withheld thousands of requested documents, and that Snyder gave misleading testimony during a deposition with committee staff, claiming more than a hundred times that he did not recall answers to investigators' questions. The committee also found that the NFL buried the findings of its own investigation and negotiated Washington's punishment directly with Snyder. Several former employees have said they were sexually assaulted while working for the Commanders and there are allegations of sexual assault against Snyder specifically as well.\n\nIn its investigation, the House Oversight Committee also found evidence of financial impropriety and passed that along to multiple state and federal authorities. As a result, DC's attorney general filed two civil lawsuits against Snyder and the team. One alleges that the team and league deceived DC consumers, the other centers on an alleged scheme to cheat ticket holders out of their deposits for season tickets.

Producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY National Housing and Economy correspondent Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy to find out the answer.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSwapna, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo let's get into real estate. What exactly is a mid-sized market, and what makes them attractive to buyers right now.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy:\n\nMid-sized markets are markets that saw lower price increases and less affordability crunch during the pandemic. And they're also expected to see the strongest growth in home sales and listing prices in the coming year. Generally speaking, these are markets where home prices are below the U.S. median of $415,000, and so they did see some amount of price growth and sales growth, but not the wild housing frenzy in places like Boise or Phoenix, for instance. What makes it attractive now is that they still have room to grow. So home sales in these markets are expected to grow by about 5%, whereas in other places, nationally, it's supposed to decline.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSo as you said, we saw housing prices go through the roof during the pandemic, but these markets didn't. Why is that?\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy:\n\nThat's an interesting question. Experts think it's because some of these places that were pricier markets suddenly became more affordable when the market rates came down. These markets were not quite as top of mind for buyers back then, so they didn't experience the same level of booming activity as some of the other markets then.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nLooking ahead, what are some of the predictions for the housing market in 2023?\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy:\n\nLooking ahead, I feel the mortgage rates should fall a little more in 2023, but they wouldn't be falling as fast as they went up. Housing market activity will continue to be relatively sluggish, even if mortgage rates do tend to come down a bit. Since so many existing home owners are locked into below 3% or 3% loans, and are not really eager to move into a higher rate, so you'll continue to see relatively low inventory next year.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nSwapna, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy:\n\nThank you so much, I had a really good time talking to you, PJ.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find more from Swapna in the Money section on USATODAY.com.\n\nAnd before we go today, a look at a couple of other stories making headlines.

Let your friends break out their Neymar jerseys or go ga-ga for Iceland. Every team that begins play later this week in Russia is flawed, and you’ll spare yourself a lot of pain over the next six weeks if you recognize now the ways that they, too, will break your heart.\n\nSo let’s rip the Band-Aid off and start knocking out your would-be favorites.\n\nPORTUGAL: Cristiano Ronaldo might be brilliant, but his whining and diving makes him soccer’s equivalent of the third grader who’s always starting trouble on the playground and then tattling on other people. You can’t root for that.\n\nMOROCCO: Not after it tried to steal a World Cup on U.S. soil! The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, had what was considered a gimme bid for the 2026 tournament until Morocco came along.

But the Ticos certainly didn’t help.\n\nThere was the stunning 2-0 upset at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J. Even worse was Costa Rica’s 2-1 loss to Panama on the final night of qualifying, which sealed the Americans’ fate. Costa Rica took an early lead in a game Panama had to win to leapfrog the U.S. for the final automatic berth, only to give up the go-ahead goal in the 87th minute.\n\nThanks for nothing, Ticos.\n\nPANAMA: See above. And to add insult to injury, replays show the tying goal shouldn’t have counted. Which would have made that late goal a moot point. Not that anyone’s holding a grudge or anything.\n\nICELAND: Borrrrriiiing. What’s the fun of jumping on an underdog’s bandwagon when everyone else is, too? Have some originality.\n\nJAPAN: This isn’t the Women’s World Cup.\n\nENEMIES OF THE STATE: Half the field could qualify for this, but Mexico has to head the list.

It’s too easy.\n\nRUSSIA: Does anything really need to be said about the inappropriateness of rooting for a country that tried to hijack our elections? And did hijack an Olympics with an elaborate, state-sponsored doping scheme?\n\nBesides, the Russians are bad, the lowest-ranked country yet to host a World Cup.\n\nTHE OTHERS: Colombia, Croatia, Denmark, Egypt, Peru, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia – they’re all fine. Some of them might even make a run. But short of Colombia declaring public holidays on knockout round gamedays, there isn’t much about these teams that stirs a whole lot of excitement.\n\nWhich leaves us just one team. There are plenty of reasons to nitpick England, but the British tabloids have that covered. And then some. Plus, this next month is going to be a constant reminder that England lost this World Cup long before it began, with FIFA choosing Russia to host instead.\n\nStill, things could be worse.

Ronaldo has never scored in a World Cup knockout match, despite competing in five tournaments.\n\nSo, who is this 21-year-old striker nicknamed “Pistoleiro” by fans?\n\nRamos celebrates with his teammates scoring against Switzerland. Michael Steele/Getty Images\n\nBenfica Campus\n\nRamos is a product of the famous Benfica academy. Known as the Benfica Campus the academy helped launch the careers of some of Ramos’ Portugal teammates, including João Félix and Rúben Dias.\n\nAt the academy, around 95 players live there at any one time, and when they transition from the Under-18s to the Under-19s, players move out into their own houses or apartments in Lisbon.\n\n“In our opinion, it was the age that they start to have their own lives,” Rodrigo Magalhães, technical coordinator for the Campus, told CNN earlier this year.\n\n“Some of them have girlfriends, some of them live two or three in an apartment. So they start a life outside the academy as we need to prepare them to live their lives because we know that a small percentage of players will achieve the goal to play in the first team or in the main leagues in Europe.\n\n“After those ages, Under-19 and Under-23, normally all of our players who progress [from the academy] can play in first divisions and second divisions here in Portugal or in other countries, but we need to prepare them if football fails.\n\n“The first objective was to develop them like human beings and we need to prepare them with a strong academic development too.”\n\nRamos joined the Benfica Campus in 2013, enjoying a stellar youth team career for the club and his national team.\n\nHe won the national title at the Under-15 and Under-17 age levels, while also finishing as the top scorer in the Under-19 Euros as Portugal finished runner-up to Spain.\n\nRamos celebrates after scoring for Benfica against FC Midtjylland during the Champions League third qualifying round first leg match. PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn a display of what was to come from Ramos, he eventually made his first-team debut for Benfica in July 2020, marking the occasion with two goals.\n\nDespite the early promise, it hasn’t been until this season that people have routinely become accustomed to seeing the name Gonçalo Ramos on the scoresheet for Benfica.\n\nFollowing Darwin Núñez’s transfer to Liverpool from the Portuguese club in the summer, Ramos has scored 14 goals in 21 matches so far this season in an impressive first half to the campaign for the Lisbon club.\n\nBenfica tops the Portuguese league table and is safely into the round of 16 stage of the Champions League having topped a group which included Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Benfica will play Club Brugge in the round of 16.\n\nRamos’ work ethic is something which has also endeared him to teammates and fans.\n\n“Of Goncalo I like two things. He’s a goalscorer. He has an incredible intuition. On top of that, he’s a great fighter. Never gives up!” Ramos’ Benfica teammate Grimaldo told Marca.\n\nRamos’ trademark celebration – where he mimics holding two pistols as he runs to the corner flag – has earned him the nickname the “Pistoleiro” or the gunman.\n\nAnd he has been firing this season.\n\nRamos celebrates scoring Portugal's fifth goal and his hattrick goal against Switzerland. Hannah Mckay/Reuters\n\nFor his country\n\nIn November, Ramos’ form for Benfica earned him an inclusion in manager Fernando Santos’ World Cup squad despite having previously not appeared for the Seleção.\n\nRamos’ debut followed in a cameo off the bench in a 4-0 drubbing of Nigeria just days before Qatar 2022. And, as he has done so often in his career, Ramos found a way to find the back of the net in that brief appearance.\n\nNonetheless with a national hero playing in his position, Ramos’ appearances in Qatar had been limited before Tuesday. He had only played a total of 10 minutes as a substitute in two of Portugal’s three Group H matches.\n\nRamos was asked by reporters after Portugal’s victory over Switzerland who his striking role models were. While he mentioned Robert Lewandowski and Zlatan Ibrahimović, there was a third name he referenced.\n\n“Cristiano Ronaldo was one of them,” said Ramos.\n\nRamos against Switzerland. Hannah Mckay/Reuters\n\nAfter the game, Ramos even admitted his selection had come a as a surprise to him.\n\n“I think not even in my wildest dreams I thought about being in the starting 11 for the knockout phase,” Ramos said, per Reuters.\n\nHe repaid Santos’ faith in the most emphatic of ways, powering a left-footed – his so-called weaker foot – effort past Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer after just 17 minutes.\n\nEarly in the second half, Ramos’ flicked home his second of the evening before then dinking the ball over Sommer to complete his hat-trick midway before being substituted to rapturous applause 15 minutes from the end.\n\nHis trio of goals ensured Ramos became the first player to score a hat-trick in his first World Cup start since Miroslav Klose against Saudi Arabia in 2002.\n\nPortuguese media swooned over the nation’s new star, with one outlet saying “Ramos makes history,” with another calling him a “demolisher.”\n\nIt also had Otávio – midfielder for Portugal and Porto, Benfica’s rivals – in two minds. “Great that he scores lots of goals for us … maybe that way he will leave Benfica,” Otávio said with a smile.\n\nRamos celebrates after scoring against Switzerland.

Went and had a CT scan and turns out everything is clear, no broken bones or anything.\"\n\nOn the final run of the competition, the three-time Olympian was seeking a score that would get him in contention.\n\nBlunck finished seventh, as he had in two previous Olympics.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nSweden beats Great Britain to win gold in men's curling\n\nNiklas Edin of Sweden has claimed the only major title missing from a career in which he has established himself as the most decorated skip in curling history.\n\nFour years after losing in the final to American upstart John Shuster in Pyeongchang, Edin led Sweden to the gold medal on Saturday, beating Britain 5-4 in the first extra-end men’s final in Olympic history.\n\n“It feels so crazy, I almost had to ask someone before I came here, ‘We have won, right?’” said Edin, who in four trips to the Winter Games has finished – in order – fourth, third, second and first.\n\nWith the podium already set up, and Canada standing by to collect the bronze it won Friday by ending the Americans’ hopes of repeating, Edin took advantage of the last-rock advantage in the first tiebreaker end and put his penultimate stone into the center of the target area.\n\nWhen British skip Bruce Mouat failed to knock it out on a ricochet, the Swedes had clinched it. They paused – it’s not polite to celebrate an opponent’s miss – and then let out a yell.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nUS men's hockey team gets noise complaint after late-night party\n\nBEIJING – Members of the U.S. men’s hockey team were involved in a noisy late-night party at the Olympic athletes village that prompted a conversation between the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Hockey.\n\nThe USOPC confirmed to The Associated Press on Saturday that a noise complaint was reported inside the village. No property damage was involved, and no one was kicked out.\n\nIt was not at all like the 1998 Nagano Olympics when U.S. hockey players - many of them NHL stars - caused $3,000 in damage by trashing apartments and throwing chairs and a fire extinguisher out windows.\n\n“We hold Team USA athletes to very high standards of personal conduct,” the USOPC said in a statement sent to The AP. “We have spoken to USA Hockey leadership, affirmed those expectations and can confirm that athletes will remain in the village until their scheduled departures.”\n\nNHL players are not at the Olympics for the second consecutive time. The U.S. team was made up of 15 college players and almost a dozen others now in European professional and North American minor leagues.\n\nThe Americans were eliminated in the quarterfinals Wednesday with a shootout loss to Slovakia. The U.S. won its first three games to earn the top seed in the knockout round.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nUS pairs skaters Alexa Knierim, Brandon Frazier finish sixth\n\nBEIJING - On the final night of figure skating competition at the Beijing Olympics, the top American team of Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier finished sixth, Team USA's best showing in the discipline since at least 2002.\n\nWith a joyful and mostly clean performance, Knierim and Frazier received 138.45 points for their free skate, moving into the lead with five pairs still to come, including the medal favorites from China and Russia. The pair also won silver medals as part of the team event earlier in the month.\n\nChina’s Sui Wenjing and Han Cong won gold. Russian duos Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov, and Anastasia Mishina and Aleskandr Galliamov, took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nThe second American pair, Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc, finished eighth after a tough outing. Cain-Gribble sprained her right ankle Wednesday, weakening her landing leg for jumps and twists. And the injury's impact was evident Saturday, as she suffered multiple falls.\n\nNevertheless, finishes of sixth and eighth will go down as a terrific showing for Team USA in an event that had largely been overlooked amid Nathan Chen's quest for gold, the long-running U.S. rivalry in ice dance and the Kamila Valieva drama in the women's event.\n\nAll told, Team USA earned three medals in figure skating in Beijing: Chen's gold, the silver in the team event and Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue's bronze in ice dance.\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nElana Meyers Taylor solidifies hold on bronze medal in two-man bobsled\n\nBEIJING The podium for two-man bobsled appears to be set even before the last run.\n\nElana Meyers Taylor solidified her hold on the bronze medal in the third run while Germany’s Laura Nolte, the leader at the midway point, widened her lead on Mariama Jamanka, her teammate and the reigning Olympic champion. Meyers Taylor is 1.17 seconds behind Nolte and 0.39 seconds behind Jamanka, gaps that are likely too big to overcome without significant mistakes by the Germans.\n\nMeyers Taylor leads Christine de Bruin of Canada by 0.72 seconds, also likely too big a margin to be overcome.\n\nIt would be the fifth Olympic medal for Meyers Taylor and second of these Games. She won silvers as a driver in 2014 and 2018, and has a bronze as a brakeman in 2010. She also won a silver Monday in the inaugural monobob event, with U.S. teammate Kaillie Humphries taking the gold.\n\nHumphries, whose monobob gold was her third overall, fell out of medal contention with another rough outing.\n\nHumphries and Kaysha Love needed to have a near-perfect run just to give themselves a chance at the medals podium, but they didn’t have a strong start and their sled went slightly sideways as they were coming out of a turn midway down the track. They’re in sixth place, more than a second behind Meyers Taylor.\n\nThis would be the first Olympic race in which Humphries did not win a medal. She won gold in 2010 and 2014, and was the bronze medalist four years ago in Pyeongchang.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nHearing being held to decide if US figure skaters get medals before closing ceremony\n\nBEIJING — The nine U.S. figure skaters who won silver medals in the team event at the 2022 Winter Olympics want to receive their medals before the conclusion of the Games.\n\nAnd they have asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport to make that happen.\n\nCAS confirmed Saturday that the American skaters filed an appeal with its ad hoc division Saturday that, if successful, would force the International Olympic Committee to award the medals for the team event before Sunday night's closing ceremony.\n\nA hearing in the case was \"currently taking place\" as of 7:30 p.m. local time in Beijing, a CAS spokesperson told USA TODAY Sports in an email, and a ruling could come by night's end.\n\nIn a letter sent to the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, earlier Saturday, an attorney for the American skaters, Paul Greene, argued that the IOC's decision not to award medals for the event – which came amid news that Russian team member Kamila Valieva had tested positive for a banned substance – runs afoul of both the Olympic charter and the host city contract.\n\n— Tom Schad and Christine Brennan\n\nUS narrowly misses out on speed skating medal\n\nBEIJING — That close.\n\nJoey Mantia finished fourth Saturday in the men’s mass start (16 laps) in one of the final opportunities for Team USA in Beijing.\n\nMantia leaned across the finish line in a dead heat with Seung Hoon Lee of South Korea but a photo finish determined he finished behind Lee to lose out on the bronze medal. Mantia is challenging the photo finish.\n\nIn a way, he felt cheated, saying after the race that Lee pulled ahead at the final (milli)second by slightly pulling Mantia's arm back.\n\n\"It looked like my blade was in front of his right before the line, and his came back in front of mine,\" Mantia said. \"In my mind, the only way for that to happen is to create momentum forward. That’s not going to happen in one step at the finish line when you started your sprint one lap earlier.\n\n\"I’m pretty biased in that situation, obviously. I want that medal. I felt like maybe I was cheated a little bit. I don’t think he did it on purpose. It’s racing.\"\n\nMantia, 36, began his career as an in-line skater in his native Florida. He and women’s 500-meter gold medalist Erin Jackson are both from Ocala, Florida.\n\nPreviously, his best individual finish at an Olympics was fourth in the 2018 1,000-meter. In the debut of mass start four years ago, Mantia finished ninth.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nMusic duo sues NBC, US Figure Skating over use of song\n\nMusic group Heavy Young Heathens filed a lawsuit on Thursday against NBC, U.S. Figure Skating and figure skating pair Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier, saying their copyright for the song \"House of the Rising Sun\" was violated when the pair used it for their short program earlier this week.\n\nThe group, comprised of brothers Robert and Aron Marderosian, are known for their compositions in numerous television shows, movies, trailers, advertisements and video games. One of their compositions, \"House of the Rising Sun\" is based on a traditional folk song and has been famously used for the film \"The Magnificent Seven\" and Ford auto commercials.\n\nDuring the team figure skating event of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Knierim and Frazier used the composition for the short program portion of the event in which the United States won a silver medal.\n\nIn the lawsuit first obtained by Reuters, the Marderosian brothers allege they were never contacted by Knierim or Frazier, Team USA or U.S. Figure Skating about licensing the track for their performance. They also allege NBC, USA Network and Peacock never inquired either since it was broadcasted on all mentioned platforms.\n\nThe group says they are \"entitled to damages in an amount to be proven at trial.\"\n\nU.S. Figure Skating told USA TODAY it does not comment on legal matters. USA TODAY has reached out to NBC on the lawsuit.\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nMikaela Shiffrin, US skiers hoping to compete in final event\n\nBEIJING — Mikaela Shiffrin is hanging in there until the very end.\n\nThe United States is still planning on competing in the team event, which was rescheduled for Sunday morning, and Shiffrin will be part of the squad, U.S. Ski Team spokeswoman Megan Harrod said. High winds forced the postponement of the event Saturday, and many teams were scrambling to change their departure plans.\n\nBut Shiffrin had said repeatedly that she wanted to do the team event, a head-to-head, single-bracket elimination competition featuring 15 teams. The Americans ski against Slovakia in the opening round, and would face Italy or Russia if they advance.\n\nThe team event will be a chance for Shiffrin to end what has been a disappointing Beijing Olympics on a positive note. Expected to contend for multiple medals here, the two-time Olympic champion did not win any in her individual events.\n\nShe recorded Did Not Finishes in the giant slalom, slalom and Alpine combined, her best events. She finished ninth in the super-G and was 18th in the downhill.\n\n“I have literally no idea why we keep coming back and doing it, especially after today,” Shiffrin said Thursday after the combined. “But I’m going to come back out and ski some parallel GS because I’m that much of an idiot. I don’t know why we keep doing it, but making good turns feels amazing.”\n\nThe start of the team event was moved up an hour Saturday in anticipation of high winds, only to be delayed twice because of gusts so strong the gondolas briefly stopped running. The forecast for Sunday calls for more wind, though there does appear to be a window mid-morning when the team event could be completed.\n\nNo event at the Winter Olympics has been canceled since 1928, Olympic historian Bill Mallon said. The 10,000 meters in men’s speedskating at those Games was halted because the ice was melting, and Mallon said it never resumed.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nJoey Mantia gives Team USA (longshot) chance at medal\n\nBEIJING — Team USA still has a chance to add to its medal total – even if it might be a longshot.\n\nJoey Mantia, 36, accrued enough sprint points (six) and went 7:44.37 in the men’s speed skating mass start (16 laps). Mantia, a former inline skater, has experience of racing while surrounded by several bodies. He finished .3 seconds behind the third-place finisher.\n\n“Sprint points” are awarded by place after the fourth, eighth and 12th laps. Those points are worth exponentially more on the final sprint, which is the last lap, ensuring that the first three across the line win gold, silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nMantia finished in sixth in his semifinal, which was the faster heat between the two races to set up the 16-skater mass start final. The event debuted during the PyeongChang Games four years ago.\n\nMantia was part of the men’s team pursuit team that won bronze Tuesday in Beijing.\n\n-- Chris Bumbaca\n\nMedals highly unlikely for U.S. in four-man bobsled\n\nBEIJING – The German sleds were dominant in the first half of the four-man bobsled race Saturday, with the two American entries falling into the middle of the pack.\n\nU.S. pilots Hunter Church and Frank Del Duca are currently 13th and 14th, respectively, making it highly unlikely they’ll be able to make up enough time in the final two runs Sunday to get into contention for a medal. Church, after a bumpy ride midway down the track at Yanqing Sliding Center, sits 1.61 seconds off the lead and 1.23 seconds out of third place. Church had the 11th fastest time on the first run.\n\nDel Duca had a relatively clean slide down but did not have enough speed to make up any ground after finishing the first run in 14th place.\n\nGerman Franceso Friedrich, whose nickname is the “Ice Kaiser,” has the lead with a cumulative time of 1:57.00, leading his teammate Johannes Lochner by .03 seconds. Another German sled piloted by Christoph Hafter is in fourth, .17 seconds behind Canada’s Justin Kripps.\n\nFriedrich is the defending champion in four-man bobsled. He’s also won the two-man bobsled event earlier in these Olympics and tied for the gold medal in 2018 with Kripps.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nHigh winds postpone skiing, final event for Mikaela Shiffrin\n\nBEIJING — Mikaela Shiffrin won’t be skiing in the team event Saturday. Nobody will.\n\nHigh winds forced the postponement of the team event, which features men and women skiers going head-to-head in a single-elimination bracket. Organizers were working to see if rescheduling was an option, but time is running out – the Beijing Olympics end Sunday – and some athletes are already booked on flights home.\n\nThe team event was Shiffrin’s last chance for a medal in Beijing. The two-time Olympic champion didn’t make the podium in any of her individual events, recording Did Not Finishes in the giant slalom and slalom and in the slalom portion of the Alpine combined. She finished ninth in the super-G and 18th in downhill.\n\n“I have literally no idea why we keep coming back and doing it, especially after today,” Shiffrin said Thursday after the combined. “But I’m going to come back out (Friday) and ski some parallel GS because I’m that much of an idiot. I don’t know why we keep doing it, but making good turns feels amazing.”\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nWhat’s next for U.S. curling skipper John Shuster?\n\nBEIJING – U.S. men’s curling skipper John Shuster, who was chosen as the American flag bearer for the opening ceremony in Beijing, will not get a whirlwind victory tour like he had after 2018. But he’s also unlikely to disappear from our lives.\n\nThough he’s already participated in five Olympic Games, Shuster is just 39 years old. Though it’s hard to say exactly how old is too old for a high-level curler, he has at least proven this much: He’s still among the elite in his sport, he’s still the best the U.S. has to offer, and he’s probably going to be back for a sixth Olympics in 2026.\n\n“I’m still enjoying it,” Shuster said after the U.S. lost to Canada in the bronze-medal match. “I know we’re one of the top teams in the world and representing my country is a tremendous honor. We have total support of our families and that kind of thing, so, yeah, we’ll keep playing.”\n\nShuster has become synonymous with the re-emergence of curling every four years for the American audience. In a sense, he is the sport in the United States.\n\nThe interesting part is how that will evolve over the next few Olympic cycles because the world has undoubtedly pushed curling to places it’s never been before. New powerhouses like 27-year-old Bruce Mouat, who leads the team from Great Britain, are younger and already very, very good. If Shuster wants to make another run at an Olympic medal, the U.S. will have to improve, too.\n\n“You can look at the percentages all the teams are shooting here, it’s just higher,” Shuster said. “The level of play in my five Olympic cycles has only increased every single time. It’s fun, and it’s also frustrating, obviously. But it’s fun to see our sport growing and getting better.”\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nWhat's next for three-time Olympic medal winner Eileen Gu?\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China – Eileen Gu knows she’s going to Stanford in the fall.\n\nBetween now and then, well, that’s a lot less clear. Fresh of claiming her third Olympic medal on Friday – a halfpipe gold that wasn’t really in question – Gu didn’t know what her immediate future held.\n\n“I have a lot of big goals coming up in the future, but I don’t really know what I’m going to be doing,” she said. “You guys will have to stay tuned on that one.”\n\nThe 18-year-old freeskier has become the biggest star of these Games, winning a gold medal in big air and silver in slopestyle in addition to her halfpipe medal. Not a bad haul for the young Olympian with a bright future.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nAmericans take silver, bronze in men's freeski halfpipe\n\nZHANGJIAKOU, China — The Olympic freeski halfpipe was kind to the Americans again, even if the weather wasn’t.\n\nDavid Wise and Alex Ferreira are again going home with medals from the Games, finishing second and third. Four years ago, they took the top two spots, respectively, as Wise won his second Olympic gold in the event.\n\nNew Zealand's Nico Porteous, who won the bronze in 2018, upgraded to gold this time around.\n\nThe skiers battled windy and cold conditions in the pipe, but Wise and Ferreira found themselves back on the podium after landing difficult tricks, even if the conditions prevented them from doing more.\n\nAmerican Aaron Blunck, the top qualifier into the finals, suffered a huge crash on his final run in attempt to reach the podium. He was eventually able to ski out of the pipe under his own power.\n\n— Rachel Axon\n\nAllergic to cold? Canadian freeskier conquers rare allergy\n\nBEIJING — Canadian freeskier Noah Bowman was the top Canadian after two runs in the men's freeski halfpipe. The 29-year-old’s success in the sport might be surprising to some who learn that he was actually allergic to the cold.\n\nYes, you read that right. Bowman had a rare condition called cold urticarial when he was 17, according to Freestyle Canada. He grew out of it a year later, which seems amazing considering he practically grew up on skis, taking up the sport at age 3 with his family.\n\nHe took up halfpipe skiing at 14 and in 2012 he won an X Games silver medal. He wasn’t even supposed to compete in the event after being invited as an alternate.\n\nBowman finished fifth in the halfpipe at the 2014 Sochi Games and four years later in Pyeongchang.\n\n— Roxanna Scott\n\nWinds delay final Alpine skiing event\n\nThe Alpine skiing mixed team parallel event has been delayed for at least an hour because of strong winds.\n\nThe event features 15 countries with mixed teams of both men and women competing in a bracket style format. Austria has the top seed and has a bye in the first round. The U.S. is the No. 6 seed and faces No. 11 Slovakia in its head-to-head matchup in the first round. Team USA would face the winner of No. 3 Italy vs. No. 14 ROC in the quarterfinals, if it advances. Switzerland is the No. 2 seed and faces host nation China, the No. 15 seed.\n\nThe American team features Mikaela Shiffrin, Paula Moltzan and AJ Hurt as the female competitors and Tommy Ford, River Radamus and Luke Winters as the male competitors.\n\nElana Meyers Taylor selected as closing ceremony flagbearer\n\nBEIJING – A frustrating but rewarding Olympics will have a cherry on top for U.S. bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor.\n\nThe four-time medalist will carry the Red, White and Blue at the Beijing Olympics closing ceremony on Sunday. She was selected to be a flagbearer with curler John Schuster during the opening ceremony, but tested positive for COVID-19 upon her arrival in China and missed the event.\n\n\"I was so honored to be named the opening ceremony flagbearer, but after not being able to carry the flag, it’s even more humbling to lead the United States at the Closing Ceremony,” Meyers Taylor said in the announcement. “Congratulations to my fellow Team USA athletes on all their success in Beijing – I'm looking forward to carrying the flag with my teammates by my side and closing out these Games.”\n\nMeyers Taylor is now the second athlete to be selected as the opening and closing flagbearer for an Olympics. Bobsled and skeleton athlete Jack Heaton carried the flag in both ceremonies at the 1948 Games in St. Moritz.\n\nTeam USA posted a video of her husband, bobsled alternate Nic Taylor, informing her of the news in their hotel lobby Friday before she competed in the two-woman bobsled heats.\n\n“This is your moment!” U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirschland wrote on Twitter. “We are so proud of you!”\n\nMeyers Taylor and her family were isolated for nearly a week. She was open about the mental and physical challenges that presented, but refused to let the deter her training. Meyers Taylor posted videos of her working out in a hotel room. Then she won a silver medal behind teammate Kaillie Humphries in the women’s debut of the monobob and is currently competing in the two-woman bobsled.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhat we know about Kamila Valieva's coach\n\nBEIJING — If all eyes weren’t on Eteri Tutberidze in the aftermath of the Kamila Valieva's disastrous free skate program, they are now.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called out Valieva’s “entourage” at a news conference Friday, saying “I was very, very disturbed yesterday when I watched the competition on TV.”\n\nBach did not name a specific individual, but said it was “chilling” to see how she was received by her camp.\n\nOn Thursday, Tutberidze was seen on the broadcast admonishing Valieva as she sat in the kiss-and-cry after her long program.\n\n“Why did you let it go? Explain it to me, why? Why did you stop fighting completely?” Tutberidze said. “Somewhere after the axel you let it go.”\n\nRead all about Tutberidze’s path to becoming a coach.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nJoey Mantia seeks to skate to speedskating medal\n\nAmerican speedskater Joey Mantia has already checked one item off his Beijing bucket list: capture a medal in the 2022 Olympics. Mantia did that in men's team pursuit when he teamed with Casey Dawson and Emery Lehman for the bronze earlier this week.\n\nBut in his third Olympics, Mantia is seeking one other prize — his first individual speedskating medal.\n\nMantia will compete Saturday in the men's mass start, where he is the reigning world champion in the event. He was also the mass start world champ in 2019 and 2017.\n\nA former inline skating world champion, Mantia turned his attention to speedskating in 2010 and in less than three years was competing at a World Cup level on the ice. Now 36, he hopes his third time at the Olympic Games will be the charm.\n\nMore medals on tap for Team USA?\n\nThe U.S. has captured 21 total medals heading into the penultimate day of competition in Beijing to rank fifth in the overall medals table. But Team USA has a good chance to add to their tally with strong medal opportunities in men's freeski halfpipe and two-man women's bobsled. Another possible medal could be gained in the mass start in men's speedskating, where Joey Mantia can become the first American man to win an individual speed skating medal since 2010.\n\nNorway continues to dominate in both overall medals with 34 and golds with 15. The ROC ranks second in total medals with 27, while Canada sits in third with 24. Germany, in fourth with 22 medals, ranks second in the gold tally with 10. The U.S. is fifth in overall medals and tied for third in golds with eight.\n\nAmerican pairs figure skater makes Winter Olympics history\n\nBEIJING — Medals will be awarded in pairs figure skating following Saturday's free skate, and while the U.S. is unlikely to earn its first medal in the event since the 1988 Calgary Games, it did make history in another way.\n\nAmerican Timothy LeDuc, skating with partner Ashley Cain-Gribble, became the first openly nonbinary athlete to compete at the Winter Olympics – a historic step for LGBTQ representation and visibility at the Games.\n\nLeDuc, whose pronouns are they/them, said they wanted it to be the beginning of a shift, a way of showing queer people that they have the opportunity \"to be open and be authentic to themselves and everything that makes them unique, and still achieve success in sport.\"\n\nLeDuc found a perfect match in 2016 with Cain-Gribble, a former singles skater who has been open about facing body shaming earlier in a career that almost forced her into retirement. LeDuc and Cain-Gribble, who have won two national championships, sit in seventh place heading into the free skate.\n\n— Tom Schad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/01/12/african-cup-the-setting-the-nicknames-and-the-big-names/96498224/", "title": "African Cup: The setting, the nicknames, and the big names", "text": "AP\n\nWhat's host country Gabon like? Who are the Eagles of Carthage, the Sparrow Hawks, and the Wild Dogs? Which big-name players are there, and who's likely to win in the end? And why are Ugandan politicians taking a pay cut in the name of soccer?\n\nSome things to know about the African Cup of Nations, which kicks off on Saturday:\n\n___\n\nGABON AGAIN\n\nThe African Cup is getting pretty familiar with Gabon, returning to the former French colony on the west coast of Africa for the second time in four tournaments. Gabon did a good enough job as co-host with Equatorial Guinea in 2012 to be given this year's event alone when war-torn Libya decided it couldn't stage it. A nation of Atlantic Ocean beaches in the west, deep tropical jungles in the north and east, and petroleum plants in the south, Gabon financed its two African Cups through its oil wealth.\n\nThis time there's an uneasy feel in the seaside capital of Libreville after deadly clashes in the streets last year following President Ali Bongo Ondimba's disputed re-election by a razor-thin margin. Still crying foul, opposition parties say they want to use the tournament, with international journalists present, to protest Bongo's rule. In this part of Africa that's normally met with force by the national police force, which is run by the military in Gabon.\n\nCONTENDERS AND BIG-NAME PLAYERS\n\nIvory Coast is the defending African champion, Ghana is always in the running, and Algeria and Senegal are making strong cases as possible title winners. All of those teams have players from the big leagues in Europe. Acccording to the European Club Association, nearly 65 percent of the 368 players at the 16-team African Cup are with European clubs.\n\nSome of the top names: Striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Germany's Borussia Dortmund is the Gabon captain. Rihad Mahrez and Islam Slimani of English champion Leicester play for Algeria. Liverpool's Sadio Mane is Senegal's star forward. Ivory Coast has defenders Eric Bailly of Manchester United and Serge Aurier of Paris Saint-Germain. Ghana has three players from the English Premier League: Christian Atsu, Andre Ayew and Daniel Amartey. Roma's Mohamed Salah is on Egypt's squad.\n\nULTIMATE UNDERDOG\n\nAt the other end of the scale, the African Cup often features little-known teams and players on the real outskirts of professional soccer who are enjoying their biggest moments. As surprises go, Guinea-Bissau is one of the biggest, qualifying for the first time ever. While its opponents show off their Premier League, Bundesliga, and Serie A talents, Guinea-Bissau captain Bocundji Ca was playing for third division French club Paris FC last season.\n\nIT'S ALL IN THE NICKNAME\n\nAfrican soccer teams love their nicknames, and you really have to have one if you are going to be taken seriously. Cameroon's Indomitable Lions became famous 27 years ago when they reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup in Italy. Here are some of the best from the 16 teams:\n\nThe Panthers: Gabon. Les Pantheres in French. Gabon's team is also known as the Brazilians because of their yellow and blue uniforms that match the five-time World Cup winner.\n\nThe Wild Dogs: Guinea-Bissau. Fits the team's underdog status perfectly.\n\nThe Eagles of Carthage: Tunisia.\n\nThe Sparrow Hawks: Togo.\n\nBlack Stars: Ghana.\n\nThe Cranes: Uganda.\n\nLions are popular this year, with Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, Senegal's Lions of Teranga, and Morocco's Atlas Lions.\n\nGENEROUS POLITICIANS? UGANDA HAS THEM\n\nMoney, or lack of it, is often an issue for African soccer teams, with players threatening strikes over unpaid wages and bonuses. This tournament is no different. Guinea-Bissau players ended a strike this week after their demands were finally met, and some Zimbabwean players refused to board a plane for the tournament until they were paid. But there's a feel-good tale this year, too. Ugandan politicians have helped out their team after it qualified for the African Cup for the first time in 39 years. Each one of Uganda's members of parliament agreed to give up $138 from their January salary, raising an extra $60,000 to help the squad prepare.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/06/04/10-world-cup-greats/9948071/", "title": "10 World Cup greats", "text": "AP\n\nWith the World Cup in Brazil looming, The Associated Press takes a look at 10 great players in the tournament's history:\n\nPELE:\n\nConsidered by many the greatest player in football history, Pele won three World Cups with Brazil. He was a teenager when he helped the \"Selecao\" lift the trophy in 1958, then four years later he won again despite playing only one match because of an injury. Pele's career was at its peak when he led Brazil to victory in 1970. He remains the only player to win three titles.\n\nDIEGO MARADONA:\n\nMaradona was joint FIFA player of the 20th century with Pele. \"El Pibe de Oro\" inspired Argentina to victory in the 1986 tournament. The English will never forgive him for his \"Hand of God\" goal en route to winning in Mexico. And perhaps his own people, the Argentines, will never forgive him for being a terrible national coach four years ago in South Africa. But as a player, Maradona was peerless in his heyday, although drug problems marred the end of his career.\n\nRONALDO:\n\nHe is the most prolific scorer in World Cups with 15. He was a youngster in the Brazil squad that won the 1994 World Cup, then helped Brazil reach the final both in 1998 and 2002. He had convulsions hours before the 1998 final in France and didn't play well in a 3-0 loss to the hosts, but four years later in Yokohama he scored twice in the final to give Brazil its fifth world title. Ronaldo's last World Cup was in 2006.\n\nZINEDINE ZIDANE:\n\nPeople who don't know football remember Zidane for the headbutt that put Marco Materazzi on the floor in the 2006 final. That earned Zidane a red card and an ignominious end to a glorious career. The connoisseurs cherish a player gifted with uncommon skill and technique, coupled with a penchant for big-game goals. The three-time world player of the year helped France win the 1998 World Cup on home soil — scoring on two headers in the final — and the 2000 European Championship. Soon after, he was sold by Juventus to Real Madrid for a then-record fee of $65 million.\n\nJUST FONTAINE\n\nFontaine holds a record that is unlikely to be broken anytime soon: Scoring 13 goals in a single tournament. Fontaine took six games to achieve his feat in 1958 in Sweden, where he was a last-minute inclusion for France. Entering the tournament, the Moroccan-born Fontaine was a little-known forward outside of the French league. Yet he tormented opponents with his speed and finishing touch — and even with someone else's boots. He had to borrow a pair after damaging his own boots in practice.\n\nFRANZ BECKENBAUER\n\nBeckenbauer defined the role of libero, and his elegant and effortless style earned him the nickname the Kaiser. Beckenbauer is the only man to captain (in 1974) and coach (1990) a team to the World Cup title. Beckenbauer made 103 appearances for Germany and is considered the football power's greatest player. He also served as coach and president of Bayern Munich, where he won every available club honor as a player. At 68, he has given up official functions but still works for television and remains vastly popular in Germany.\n\nJOHAN CRUYFF\n\nHe never won a World Cup, never was top scorer and played only one final tournament. Yet it was more than enough to turn Johan Cruyff into a World Cup great because less than a handful of the game's greatest stars combined beauty, speed, vision and elegance like he did. At the 1974 event in West Germany, Cruyff led the Oranje with guile and cockiness as the Netherlands beat teams like Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil with free-flowing \"Total Football\" to reach the final against the host team. In his finest moment, the lanky playmaker used his dumbfounding body feints and speed to cut through the German defense from the opening kickoff to force a penalty and give the Netherlands the surprise lead. Shockingly, with the cup for the taking, Cruyff and the Dutch machine sputtered and stopped.\n\nEUSEBIO\n\nOf all the spectacular moments in Eusebio's two-decade career, perhaps the most memorable was the comeback he inspired by Portugal against North Korea in the quarterfinals of the 1966 event in England. After Portugal fell 3-0 behind, Eusebio scored four goals in just over 30 minutes, demonstrating the athletic prowess and sure-eyed finishing that made him one of the world's top scorers in the 1960s. Born into poverty in Africa, Eusebio became known as the Black Panther for his agility and hard-charging attacks. He was awarded the Ballon d'Or in 1965, and twice won the Golden Boot - in 1968 and 1973 - for being top scorer in Europe. He died in January.\n\nLEV YASHIN\n\nThe only goalkeeper ever voted European footballer of the year, Lev Yashin helped to redefine goalkeeping, producing acrobatic saves and marshalling his defense as few had done before. After bursting onto the international scene with spectacular stops against eventual winner Brazil at the 1958 tournament, he led the Soviet Union to fourth place in 1966, a result the team has yet to better. During a 20-year professional sports career, Yashin's exceptional reflexes even allowed him to be a multi-sport champion, winning the Soviet Cup ice hockey trophy with Dynamo Moscow.\n\nGIUSEPPE MEAZZA\n\nRegarded by many as the greatest Italian player, Meazza played in two World Cups, and Italy won both. Born and bred in a Milan suburb, the diminutive Meazza was 24 when Italy hosted the tournament in 1934. Used on the right wing rather than his favorite center-forward position, he unsettled defenses with his dribbles and set up the move that led to Angelo Schiavio's winner in the final against Czechoslovakia. Four years later, his only goal was from the penalty spot against Brazil in the semifinals, his last appearance in an Italy shirt. AC Milan and Inter renamed their venue Stadio Giuseppe Meazza (better known as San Siro) after his death in 1979.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/955295/everyone-loves-the-darts-world-championship-for-the-ages", "title": "'Everyone loves the darts': a world championship for the ages | The ...", "text": "Forget the festive football and Ashes cricket, there was only one event that sports fans were tuning into over Christmas and New Year: the PDC World Darts Championship. After starting on 15 December the 2021-2022 tournament came to an end on Monday with Peter “Snakebite” Wright securing his second world title with a 7-5 victory over Michael “Bully Boy” Smith.\n\nMonday’s final at Alexandra Palace in north London – or “Ally Pally” to keep with the nickname theme – was an “epic battle”, said Metro’s Phil Haigh. Scotsman Wright, 51, “found his best form when it mattered as he surged to victory over the last two sets”. “Snakebite” took home the huge £500,000 top prize while Englishman Smith had to settle for the £200,000 runner-up cheque.\n\nAfter Wright was declared the world champion for a second time, his fans would have been “dancing on the streets” of his home town Livingston, said the Daily Record. This win was “for them” as much as it was for Wright, who overcame a “hostile crowd” to take the title. “Scotland beat England everywhere they go…”\n\n‘He will trounce everybody’\n\nAt the end of one of the “tightest” world championship finals in recent memory, “there were tears all round”, The Telegraph reported. For Wright, “whose outlandish mohawk hairstyle and Snakebite moniker bely a quietly emotional man”, they were tears of joy. For 31-year-old Smith, “who must fear never realising his bountiful potential”, they were tears of despair. This was his sixth defeat in as many major finals.\n\nAfter the match Smith said he “must have done something terrible in a past life because it’s doing my head in now”. Wright responded by describing his opponent as “the future of darts”. “I just love him [Smith] to bits,” Wright said. “I feel bad. As soon as he gets a major, he will trounce everybody. He’s going to be a future world champion.”\n\n‘Last big Christmas party’\n\nIt was expected that the World Darts Championship would welcome “80,000 boozed-up fans” over its two weeks, the Daily Mail reported. It was the “last big Christmas party” that wasn’t cancelled despite rising fears over the Omicron variant in the UK.\n\nInside Ally Pally there were more than 3,000 “singing, costumed spectators” for each of the 28 sessions, DW said. And according to a tweet from PDC chairman Eddie Hearn, 1.49 million people tuned into the final which was shown live on Sky Sports. This was the second highest audience in the tournament’s history.\n\nEveryone loves the darts – fact\n\nThis was a “tournament for the ages”, said The Guardian’s Sean Ingle. And the “purity, passion and drama” on show proves that darts’ renaissance continues. “From smoky nightclubs in the 1980s to sold-out arenas today, the sport keeps rising because it makes for compelling viewing.”\n\nThe classic chant – “stand up if you love the darts” – was regularly heard during the final as the capacity crowd “rose to its feet and sung its hearts out”, said Simon Kelner in The i Paper. The fans celebrated the “simple virtues of a sport that, in a time of pandemic and political uncertainty, can restore the human spirit”.

Starring Kate Winslet as a small-town cop just outside of Philadelphia, \"Mare\" is a mystery on the outside and a personal family drama in its interior. Its characters are deeply real and expertly drawn, its sense of place firmly established and specific and its clues genuinely shocking. It's intense and satisfying to watch, going to places your average murder mystery wouldn't aspire.\n\nSet in the depressed hamlet of Easttown, Pennsylvania, Mare, a detective with the local police, is investigating the recent murder of teen mom Erin McMenamin (Cailee Spaeny), which may be connected to the disappearance of two other young women in the small town. Soft-spoken county detective Colin Zabel (Evan Peters) is called in to help with the case, and though Mare eventually warms to him, she is initially annoyed by the young, peppy cop following at her heels.\n\nMore:Kate Winslet on HBO’s ‘Mare of Easttown,’ her ‘Titanic’ accent and funny nickname from Jack Black\n\nAs twisty as the mystery is, far more riveting are the turns in Mare's life, battling trauma and grief while messily trying to do well for her family, which is complex and ingrained with tragedy. The 45-year-old actress plays a grandmother whose son had a child young before taking his own life. Now a divorced Mare is raising her 4-year-old grandson with the help of her mother Helen (Jean Smart, an absolute treat as usual) and teen daughter Siobhan (Angourie Rice), trying to swat away custody claims by the boy's mother Carrie (Sosie Bacon), who is battling addiction issues. Her ex-husband (David Denman) is newly engaged, which makes Mare slightly more amenable to the advances of new-in-town writer Richard Ryan (Guy Pearce).\n\nIt's a lot, and Mare bears the stress of her home as best she can, if not entirely successfully, throwing herself into her cases with sometimes less than professional standards.\n\nWinslet's utter dedication to the role, down to her near-perfect assimilation of the regional accent (which, as a resident of Southeastern Pennsylvania I can give my stamp of approval to) enhances the already engrossing script. Mare is so inherently human, deeply flawed but deeply relatable. She occasionally does something so loathsome it would have made a lesser character in the hands of a lesser actress irredeemable, but Mare's appeal helps soften the blow.\n\nPeters is Winslet's equal foil, his Colin as bright-eyed as Mare is cynical, fully enamored of his crusty partner from the moment he brought her some Wawa coffee. The series is a surprising showcase for the actor, who finally gets a grown up grown-up role after years of playing teens and juvenile superheroes on series like \"American Horror Story\" and films like \"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\"\n\nThe script is well-written by creator Brad Ingelsby (\"The Way Back\"), loosely inspired by his own upbringing in nearby Berwyn, Pennsylvania. The series was shot locally and it's easy to tell, as the setting is so palpable and dynamic. Winslet is surrounded by a superb supporting cast. In addition to Peters, Smart is a joy in every scene she appears in, a disaffected older woman playing games on her iPad and cracking jokes to her daughter.\n\nThe greatness of \"Mare\" is unfortunately built on the same lurid violence against women that permeates other crime dramas. Occasional shots of Erin's naked dead body or sex workers stripping for clients feel completely out of place with the more measured tone of the rest of the series. Only five of the miniseries' seven episodes were made available for review, but its exploitative scenes so far feel more like an aberration than anything else. Crime dramas obviously necessitate a criminal act to investigate, but there have been quite enough sexualized dead women on TV screens for the past two decades.\n\nBut \"Mare\" is the kind of show that is better than the sum of its parts (and that sum was already pretty good). Viewers may start it thinking they know where it's going, feel like it's a standard, cookie-cutter cop show they've seen before, but they'll be slowly and gently surprised by just how good it is.\n\nMore:How to watch the new Kate Winslet show everyone's talking about\n\nMore:2021 TV premiere dates, including 'The Bachelorette,' 'AGT': Your favorite shows, new addictions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/12/01/lions-and-jaguars-face-off-sunday-in-possible-shootout/51034231/", "title": "Lions and Jaguars face off Sunday in possible shootout", "text": "AP\n\nJACKSONVILLE (4-7) at DETROIT (4-7)\n\nSunday, 1 p.m. EST, CBS\n\nFANDUEL SPORTSBOOK NFL LINE: Lions by 1.\n\nSERIES RECORD: Lions lead 4-3.\n\nLAST MEETING: Lions beat Jaguars 34-16 on Oct. 18, 2020, in Jacksonville.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NFL Scores and Schedules\n\nJAGUARS OFFENSE: OVERALL (9), RUSH (9), PASS (13), SCORING (16).\n\nJAGUARS DEFENSE: OVERALL (24), RUSH (14), PASS (25), SCORING (14).\n\nLIONS OFFENSE: OVERALL (8), RUSH (10), PASS (12), SCORING (8).\n\nLIONS DEFENSE: OVERALL (32), RUSH (30), PASS (29), SCORING (32).\n\nTURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Dolphins plus-2; Lions even.\n\nJAGUARS PLAYER TO WATCH: ILB Chad Muma had nine tackles in his first career start against Baltimore and coach Doug Pederson said Muma “did enough in that game to give him another opportunity.” So Muma gets the nod again over fellow rookie Devin Lloyd, the 27th overall pick.\n\nLIONS PLAYER TO WATCH: RB D’Andre Swift. In the first two games of the season, Swift ran for 200 yards on 20 carries, added another 62 yards receiving and scored two touchdowns. In the next nine games, dealing with shoulder and ankle problems, he’s only carried 30 times for 92 yards and caught 19 passes for 124 yards. He’s scored three times, but the Lions need him to play a bigger role in the offense.\n\nKEY MATCHUP: Jacksonville’s rushing game against Detroit’s defense. The Jaguars might not have leading rusher Travis Etienne (foot), and James Robinson is with the Jets, which leaves JaMycal Hasty. Hasty carried 12 times for 28 yards in Sunday’s 28-27 win over the Baltimore Ravens —the first time he’d run more than four times all season. The Lions, though, are giving up an average of 170 rushing yards in their past three games.\n\nKEY INJURIES: Pederson called RB Travis Etienne “day to day” with a sprained right foot. “I want to make sure that he’s 100% before we stick him out there.” Detroit’s offensive line is banged up, but the bigger concern might be cornerback Jeff Okudah (concussion). Without him, Trevor Lawrence might have a big day.\n\nSERIES NOTES: The teams have only met seven times, and the most well known was the first one. On Dec. 17, 1995, Tom Coughlin’s Jaguars came to the Pontiac Silverdome and lost 44-0 to Wayne Fontes and the Lions. The Lions intercepted four passes, Barry Sanders and Johnnie Morton each scored twice and it was 27-0 at halftime. What bothered Jacksonville was, with the ball on the Jaguars 18 and more than five minutes left, Detroit took a knee. Several Jaguars players saw it as a way to humiliate them.\n\nSTATS AND STUFF: The Lions are eighth in average yards per play while the Jaguars are 14th, but the difference is only 5.8 to 5.6. ... The Lions have three players with a 50-yard rush this season — Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jamaal Williams, but only one with a 50-yard reception — TE T.J. Hockenson, who has been traded to the Minnesota Vikings. ... The Jaguars have lost an NFL-record 19 consecutive games against NFC teams. ... QB Trevor Lawrence is coming off the best game of his career, throwing for a season-high 321 yards, with three touchdowns and no interceptions. He’s completed 77% of his passes for 815 yards over his past three games, with six TDs and no picks. … Veteran WR Marvin Jones returns to Detroit for the first time since leaving the Lions to sign with Jacksonville in 2021. He had a clutch, shin-dragging touchdown catch last week to help beat the Ravens. Jones has played his entire 11-year NFL career for teams with cats as nicknames — Bengals, Lions and Jaguars.\n\nFANTASY TIP: With Okudah banged up, Lawrence should be able to have another big game.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/01/14/african-cup-opens-in-libreville-now-heads-to-the-jungle/96588686/", "title": "African Cup opens in Libreville, now heads to the jungle", "text": "AP\n\nLIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) — The African Cup of Nations in Gabon will temporarily leave behind the beaches and palm trees of the capital Libreville and head deep into the jungle to Franceville in the far west for the next games on Sunday when two title contenders, Algeria and Senegal, open their campaigns.\n\nHere are some things to know with the African Cup underway:\n\n___\n\nPARTY WITH PROBLEMS\n\nSaturday's opening ceremony at Libreville's Stade de l'Amitie was a riot of color and noise, although the stadium wasn't even half full for the start. Acrobats in red, blue and yellow leotards wriggled and jiggled while suspended on wires from one of the stadium's two giant arches, flames and fireworks burst into the air, and a dancer took to the stage dressed as a soccer shirt-wearing black panther in recognition of Gabon's national team nickname, the Panthers. The ceremony reached a crescendo, as the fan numbers grew, with a performance by French rapper Booba, a social media phenomenon and the latest foreign superstar to be booked by an African Cup host. At the last cup in neighboring Equatorial Guinea, Akon made a surprise appearance.\n\nBut this can be a party with problems. As fans danced away in Libreville, now fully into the fun, no fewer than 100 Congolese officials headed to the far northern town of Oyem to try and convince their players to end a strike over unpaid bonuses, a regular African soccer problem. The Congo players earlier posted a video on social media where, standing huddled together, they complained about their treatment. Captain Youssouf Mulumbu called their treatment \"deplorable\" on Twitter but still promised they would play their first game against Morocco on Monday.\n\nAlso, Togo coach Claude le Roy, a veteran manager at African Cups dating to the mid-1980s, said his players were left waiting by organizers at the crowded Libreville airport for five hours on Friday without food or water, with their official transport failing to show up.\n\n\"It doesn't bother me that they have readied all these salons and lodges and things for the big officials, but you would think that the most important thing in the African Cup of Nations would be the players,\" Le Roy said.\n\nCROWDS OF LITTLE CONCERN\n\nThe opening game featuring host Gabon against Guinea-Bissau was ultimately just about full by the time the soccer began, helped by tickets prices at 80 US cents each. The tickets were advertised on billboards along Libreville's main Atlantic Ocean boulevard alongside the slogan \"Everyone at the stadium!\" in French. But don't expect full, or even half-full, stadiums everywhere. Franceville, venue for Sunday's games, may be the president's hometown but a big crowd is not expected at Stade de Franceville, an arena that pops up, bright blue and yellow, out of lush jungle vegetation near the border with Republic of Congo. Unreliable attendances is just the way it is at the African Cup and organizers won't lose any sleep over it, remembering that around 200 people — yes 200 — watched an African Cup quarterfinal in Equatorial Guinea in 2012. The party went on.\n\nALGERIA'S ATTACK\n\nSunday's second day of games features two teams tipped to be title contenders. Algeria's attack has attracted plenty of attention, led by English Premier League forwards Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani of champion Leicester and attacking midfielder Yacine Brahimi of Porto. Algeria opens Group B against Zimbabwe, back at the Cup of Nations for the first time in a decade.\n\nSOLID SENEGAL\n\nSenegal was even better than Algeria in qualifying for this tournament and has a squad packed with talent from the Spanish, Italian, English and French leagues. Senegal plays Le Roy's Togo in its first game.\n\n___\n\nFollow Gerald Imray on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/14"}]}

Collins defines it as “a unique digital certificate, registered in a blockchain, that is used to record ownership of an asset such as an artwork or a collectible.”\n\nMost people didn’t know what an NFT was until this year, when sales boomed, sparked in large part by artist Beeple’s March auction of a digital collage NFT for nearly $70 million. Other highlights include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey selling an NFT of his first tweet for $2.9 million and electronic musician Grimes selling $6 million worth for her digital art.\n\nExperts at Collins, based in Glasgow, Scotland, said Wednesday they chose NFT because of its “meteoric rise in usage,” up 11,000% in 2021.\n\n“NFTs seem to be everywhere, from the arts sections to the financial pages and in galleries and auction houses and across social media platforms,” said Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins Learning. But whether NFT will have a lasting influence is yet to be determined, he added.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary’s publisher, meanwhile, recently chose vax as its word of the year, as interest in vaccinations spiked over the past 12 months.\n\nMore: Olympic champion Simone Biles to release new batch of NFTs inspired by her groundbreaking moves\n\nDigital images sell for millions: These NFTs sold for ridiculously high prices", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/06/dictionary-com-allyship-2021-word/6408641001/", "title": "Dictionary.com names 'allyship' it's 2021 word of the year", "text": "Leanne Italie\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK — Allyship, an old noun made new again, is Dictionary.com's word of the year.\n\nThe look up site with 70 million monthly users took the unusual step of anointing a word it added just last month, though “allyship” first surfaced in the mid-1800s, said John Kelly, the site's associate director of content and education.\n\n“It might be a surprising choice for some,” he told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's unveiling. “In the past few decades, the term has evolved to take on a more nuanced and specific meaning. It is continuing to evolve and we saw that in many ways.”\n\nThe site offers two definitions for allyship: The role of a person who advocates for inclusion of a “marginalized or politicized group” in solidarity but not as a member, and the more traditional relationship of “persons, groups or nations associating and cooperating with one another for a common cause or purpose.”\n\nThe word is set apart from “alliance,” which Dictionary.com defines in one sense as a “merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states or organizations.”\n\nIt's the first definition that took off most recently in the mid-2000s and has continued to churn. Following the summer of 2020 and the death of George Floyd, white allies — and the word allyship — proliferated as racial justice demonstrations spread. Before that, straight allies joined the causes of LGBTQ oppression, discrimination and marginalization.\n\n“This year, we saw a lot of businesses and organizations very prominently, publicly, beginning efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Allyship is tied to that. In the classroom, there is a flashpoint around the term critical race theory. Allyship connects with this as well,” Kelly said.\n\nIn addition, teachers, frontline workers and mothers who juggled jobs, home duties and child care in lockdown gained allies as the pandemic took hold last year.\n\nWithout an entry for “allyship,” Kelly said the site saw a steep rise in lookups for “ally” in 2020 and large spikes in 2021. It was in the top 850 searches out of thousands and thousands of words this year. Dictionary.com broadened the definition of “ally” to include the more nuanced meaning. The terms “DEI” and “critical race theory” made their debuts as entries on the site with “allyship” this year.\n\nWhat it means to be an authentic ally has taken on fresh significance as buzz around the word has grown louder. One of the aspects of allyship, as it has emerged, is how badly it can go.\n\nAmong the example's of how to use the word in a sentence cited by Merriam-Webster is this one written by Native activist Hallie Sebastian: “Poor allyship is speaking over marginalized people by taking credit and receiving recognition for arguments that the unprivileged have been making for their entire lives.”\n\nAs global diversity, equity and inclusion executive Sheree Atcheson wrote in Forbes, allyship is a “lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency and accountability with marginalized individuals and/or groups of people.” It's not, she said, “self-defined — work and efforts must be recognized by those you are seeking to ally with.”\n\nAllyship should be an “opportunity to grow and learn about ourselves, whilst building confidence in others,” Atcheson added.\n\nAmong the earliest evidence of the word “allyship,” in its original sense of “alliance,” is the 1849, two-volume work, “The Lord of the Manor, or, Lights and Shades of Country Life” by British novelist Thomas Hall: “Under these considerations, it is possible, he might have heard of Miss Clough’s allyship with the Lady Bourgoin.”\n\nKelly did some additional digging into the history of allyship in its social justice sense. While the Oxford English Dictionary dates that use of the word to the 1970s, Kelly found a text, “Allies of the Negro” by Albert W. Hamilton, published in 1943. It discusses extensively the potential allies of Black people in the struggle for racial equality:\n\n“What some white liberals are beginning to realize is that they better begin to seek the Negro as an ally,” he wrote. “The new way of life sought by the liberal will be a sham without the racial equality the Negro seeks. And the inclusion of the Negro in the day-to-day work, in the organization, the leadership and the rallying of the support necessary to win a better world, can only be done on the basis of equality.”\n\nOn the other side of allyship, Kelly said, \"is a feeling of division, of polarization. That was Jan. 6.” Allyship, he said, became a powerful prism in terms of the dichotomy at a chaotic cultural time during the last two years.\n\nOther dictionary companies in the word of the year game focused on the pandemic and its fallout for their picks. Oxford Languages, which oversees the Oxford English Dictionary, went for “vax” and Merriam-Webster chose “vaccine.” The Glasgow, Scotland-based Collins Dictionary, meanwhile, plucked “NFT,” the digital tokens that sell for millions.\n\nWhile Merriam-Webster relies solely on site search data to choose a word of the year, Dictionary.com takes a broader approach.

Others might know it as the name of a Simpsons character or an ancient Greek poet.\n\n“Many players outside the US had not heard this word before,” added the news release. “Huge numbers of players expressed their frustration and annoyance on social media, but many also turned to the Cambridge Dictionary to find out more.”\n\n“Still angry about ‘homer,’” one person tweeted on May 31. “It’s been weeks now.

Last week, it was added as a new entry on Dictionary.com, meaning \"the tendency among members of the dominant white cultural group to have a defensive, wounded, angry, or dismissive response to evidence of racism.\"\n\nDictionaries catalog new words that reflect the national conversation, says DiAngelo, author of the bestseller \"White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk about Racism.\" She says naming and defining \"white fragility\" helps increase the public's understanding of systemic racism and interrupts \"a key way that racism is protected.\"\n\n\"Having language to describe a very familiar experience (white emotional irrationality, ignorance, arrogance and resistance on issues of racism) has been incredibly important for people of color, and helped counter the white denial and gas-lighting,\" she said in an email. \"It has also been important for white people to have these patterns named and challenged, making it harder to engage in them without accountability.\"\n\nIt used to take decades for new words and phrases to find their way into everyday language and onto the pages of dictionaries. Today, they can break into mainstream use in months, or even weeks.\n\nWhat's accelerating their adoption? Social media, which is one of the major factors shaping language today, lexicographers say.\n\nNew words get invented and gain currency on Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube. The more they get used, the more likely they will land on the radars of lexicographers, the editors who closely track the use of new words to help dictionaries accurately explain how people are using them.\n\nLexicographers determine if these words merit entries and definitions of their own. Some dictionaries then promote them on their own social media channels with such features as \"word of the day.\"\n\n\"Social media is a huge amplifier,\" says Katherine Martin, head of lexical content strategy for Oxford Dictionaries. Martin says. \"Not everything catches the English-speaking imagination. But if it's the right time for something, the existence of social media makes it possible for the word to become successful much faster.\"\n\nBecause dictionaries reflect what people are talking about, many new words arise from the current flashpoints in the national debate over race, identity and culture, says Aria Razfar, professor of education and linguistics at University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nAmong the terms added to Dictionary.com last week: \"Latinx,\" a gender-neutral term defined as \"of or relating to people of Latin American descent,\" \"colorism,\" referring to the \"differential treatment based on skin color, especially favoritism toward those with a lighter skin tone and mistreatment or exclusion of those with a darker skin tone, typically among those of the same racial group or ethnicity\" and \"white lash,\" \"a hostile or violent reaction by white people to the advances or influx of other racial or ethnic groups.\"\n\n\"Once a word or a phrase becomes part of the dictionary, it's a good indicator that the ideas behind it have become more mainstream and being discussed on a wider scale. It gives us a way to discuss the underlying issues that the word points to,\" Razfar says.\n\nTerms such as white fragility \"provide a language so that dominant society could interrogate itself and really look at itself in the mirror in terms of its relationship with non-dominant populations and oppressed groups,\" he says.\n\nIn the digital age, online dictionaries remain one of the more trusted sources of facts at a time when everyone's objectivity is constantly being questioned. People turn to the online versions of these reference books to learn the meaning of unknown words. Most commonly, dictionaries reflect \"descriptive lexicography,\" meaning editors examine how people use words and determine their meaning.\n\nDictionaries reflect the culture, but do not set it, says Jesse Sheidlower, a lexicographer and past president of the American Dialect Society. And much of that culture being reflected is what bubbles up from social media.\n\nSocial media makes it easier for people with shared interests to band together and develop their own language. The platforms provide equal access, making it easier for people of color and other groups that have been marginalized or oppressed to get their voices heard.\n\n\"It's very possible for a word to spread very quickly in a short amount of time in a more organic way than in the past,\" Sheidlower says.\n\nThat's what has happened with new terms such as white privilege or white fragility, says Martin, of Oxford Dictionaries, who has spent 15 years studying new words and their emergence.\n\n\"Increasingly there are a greater variety of voices and perspectives being heard. That means there are people who are interrogating the concept of whiteness,\" she says. \"There wasn't as much visibility for those conversations and critiques a couple of decades ago.

Oh, there’s also splooting: “the act of lying flat on the stomach with the legs stretched out.”\n\nMerriam-Webster: gaslighting\n\n“the act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one’s own advantage.”\n\nMerriam-Webster noted that searches for this term increased 1740% this year. Never an organization to shy away from the political side of things, MW specifically connected this term to the ubiquity of fake news and conspiracy theories.\n\nOther top words from MW this year were oligarch, omicron, codify and queen consort. Truly a mini tour of international news, from Roe v. Wade to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOh, but that’s not all! Choices from other international English language giants really add some color to the confusing tapestry that was 2022:\n\nCambridge Dictionary: homer\n\n“Short for home run: a point scored in baseball when you hit the ball, usually out of the playing field, and are able to run around all the bases at one time to the starting base”\n\nDon’t be fooled! You can draw a direct through-line between this common sports term and “goblin mode,” since interest in “homer” spiked after it was featured in the online game “Wordle” – a daily staple for goblins and wordsmiths everywhere. Non-American English speakers, however, were not pleased. (This is also an absolutely hilarious definition to American baseball fans, and hopefully we say a lot of sports things that give our British friends a chuckle in return.)\n\nMacquarie Dictionary (an Australian English dictionary): teal\n\n“A political candidate who holds generally ideologically moderate views, but who supports strong action regarding environmental and climate action policies, and the prioritising of integrity in politics”\n\nThe term comes from the fact that many of these candidates wore the color teal. Several such candidates prevailed in Australia’s federal elections this year. “Teal embodies the year that’s been, and truth-telling is the year that’s to come – let’s hope that’s the case,” the Macquarie committee said. “They’re both really important concepts, central to Australian culture and politics.”\n\nWhen normal words just won’t do\n\nSo, to recap: There were a lot of crises this year, political and otherwise, and they exhausted us in ways we could barely describe. In fact, sometimes life got so weird we literally needed to invent new words to describe it.\n\nSuch words are called “neologisms,” or words that are fairly new on the English language scene. These are the greener phrases some old-school lexiphiles often pooh-pooh, raising their hands to the sky in lament for what the language has become. Then, there are those like literary icon Stephen King, who see these young words and know exactly what to do with them.\n\n“When you come across a new word that just clicks, there’s something so comforting about the realization that someone else has had the same experience or thought,” says Martha Barnette, co-host of “A Way with Words,” a radio show and podcast.\n\nBarnette says new words are thrown at us all the time; others arise organically to serve a certain purpose that others do not.\n\n“The words that end up lasting are the ones that are useful, and that arise unobtrusively,” she says. “Some words are kind of imposed on us, from media or marketing, and those can be a flash in the pan.”\n\nFor the strictly rule abiding linguists among us, Barnette offers a reminder that dictionaries aren’t prescriptive – in that, they aren’t necessarily a record of how language should be used.\n\n“They’re a reflection of how our language is, of how people are talking and using it,” she says.\n\nInnumerable words that we use every day, like “laser,” “lonely” and “critic,” were once strange neologisms on the fringe of our usage. (Laser, of course, is actually an acronym, and we have Shakespeare to thank for “lonely” and, ironically, “critic.”) Neologisms can be formed from a word borrowed from another language, like “cliché;” shortening words, like “flu,” or smashing two words together. It’s also common for neologisms to stem from entertainment or media, like “gaslighting” does. Many are also portmanteaus, like “permacrisis.”\n\nTo truly come full circle, many of this year’s top words were once “sniglets” (which is, in and of itself, a neologism). A sniglet is a humorous term coined by comedian Rich Hall in the 1980s that describes “any word that doesn’t appear in the dictionary, but should.”\n\nSo congratulations, “splooting” and “goblin mode.” The sniglets have become promising neologisms, and now, for better or worse, they’re some of the most meaningful words of 2022. What does that say about us? Well, maybe we need a new word for that, too.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/12/15/youthquake-oxford-dictionaries-word-year-what/954931001/", "title": "'Youthquake' is Oxford's word of 2017.

It dates to Dec. 31, 1975, when former university public relations director Bill Rabe and his colleagues cooked up the idea to banish overused words and phrases from the language. They issued the first list on New Year's Day 1976.\n\nThrough the years, Lake Superior State has received tens of thousands of nominations for the list, which is closing in on its 1,000th banishment.\n\nThis year's list of seven words was culled from more than 2,000 nominations on the university's website, spokesman Thomas Pink said. Several dozen of those were for selfie.\n\n\"People have taken pictures of themselves for almost as long as Samuel Eastman's company made film and cameras.

It may only be a matter of time before photos of one's self and a friend will become 'dualies.'

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nIn addition, how coffee is brewed can also affect its benefits for health. Filtered coffee catches a compound called cafestol that exists in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/health/alcohol-brain-shrinkage-wellness/index.html", "title": "One drink per day can shrink your brain, study says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust one pint of beer or average glass of wine a day may begin to shrink the overall volume of the brain, a new study has found, and the damage worsens as the number of daily drinks rises.\n\nOn average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine (two alcohol units) a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank a half of a beer (one unit), according to the study, which published Friday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe brains of people that age who said they drank three alcohol units a day had reductions in both white and gray matter that looked as if they had added 3.5 years to the ages of their brains.\n\nOne alcohol unit is 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure alcohol. That means 25 milliliters or a single shot of liquor is one unit; a 16-ounce can of beer or cider is two units; and a standard 6-ounce glass of wine (175 milliliters) is two units.\n\nThe brains of nondrinkers who began consuming an average of one alcohol unit a day showed the equivalent of a half a year of aging, according to the study.\n\nIn comparison, drinking four alcohol units a day aged a person’s brain by more than 10 years.\n\n“It’s not linear. It gets worse the more you drink,” first author Remi Daviet, an assistant professor of marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.\n\n“A problem in this study is that they only have information on people’s drinking habits for the one year prior to the (brain) imaging,” said alcohol researcher Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\n“I think this is a major limitation of the study as it’s likely that the cumulative consumption of alcohol throughout one’s lifetime is associated with the brain, not just the level of consumption right before the images were taken,” she added.\n\n“The relationship between alcohol and health is complex, and our understanding of that relationship is evolving over time. Based on this study, I would not really draw any definitive conclusions, but I would say that the authors have identified areas for further research.”\n\nBenefits of alcohol?\n\nDoctors used to believe that moderate amounts of alcohol could provide a health benefit, especially to the heart and the brain, but recent research has called that assumption into question. A number of studies have found no amount of drinking to be healthy, and the World Heart Federation recently published a policy brief saying there is “no level of alcohol consumption that is safe for health.”\n\n“Small amounts of alcohol are associated with health benefits for some conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes, but harmful for others, such as road traffic accidents and breast cancer,” Gakidou said, adding there are others, such as a stroke, where the outcome isn’t clear.\n\n“There isn’t really a simple answer for a given individual,” she said. “Based on what we do know at this time, whether small amounts of alcohol are beneficial or harmful for an individual depends on that person’s health status and their risk profile. … Are they more prone to heart disease or cancer?”\n\nBrain scans and large study size\n\nThe report analyzed data from more than 36,000 people who took part in the UK Biobank study, which houses in-depth genetic and health information on more than 500,000 middle-aged adults living in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople in the study had provided information on the number of drinks they had each week in the previous year and had undergone an MRI brain scan. Researchers compared their scans with images of typical aging brains and then controlled for such variables as age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry and overall head size.\n\n“The fact that we have such a large sample size allows us to find subtle patterns, even between drinking the equivalent of half a beer and one beer a day,” coauthor Gideon Nave, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.\n\n“Having this dataset is like having a microscope or a telescope with a more powerful lens,” Nave said. “You get a better resolution and start seeing patterns and associations you couldn’t before.”\n\nHe told CNN that is why this study was able to find a more distinct pattern of association between drinking and brain volume than past studies. However, he added, the results are just that – an association – as the study could not prove cause and effect.\n\n“Our study is by far the largest investigation of the topic,” Nave said. “It uses a general population sample, and it controls for more confounds than before. As such, it provides overwhelmingly more evidence than any previous investigations and gets us closer to settling the debate.”\n\nHowever, the study left a number of questions unanswered, such as a person’s cognitive engagement, Gakidou said.\n\n“I believe that there is sufficient evidence that suggests that brain function decays faster among those that are not engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, either through work or hobbies,” she said.\n\n“My main criticism is that the authors are overinterpreting the findings of their study and drawing conclusions that are not necessarily supported by what is presented in the paper.

It found that the brains of those who had Covid-19 had a greater loss of gray matter and abnormalities in the brain tissue compared with those who didn’t have Covid-19. Many of those changes were in the area of the brain related to the sense of smell.\n\n“We were quite surprised to see clear differences in the brain even with mild infection,” lead author Gwenaëlle Douaud, an associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Oxford, told CNN in an email.\n\nDouaud and her colleagues evaluated brain imaging from 401 people who had Covid-19 between March 2020 and April 2021, both before infection and an average of 4½ months after infection. They compared the results with brain imaging of 384 uninfected people similar in age, socioeconomics and risk factors such as blood pressure and obesity. Of the 401 infected people, 15 had been hospitalized.\n\nThe 785 participants were between the ages of 51 and 81 and were all part of the UK Biobank, an ongoing government health database of 500,000 people begun in 2012.\n\nDouaud explained that it is normal for people to lose 0.2% to 0.3% of gray matter every year in the memory-related areas of the brain as they age, but in the study evaluation, people who had been infected with the coronavirus lost an additional 0.2% to 2% of tissue compared with those who hadn’t been infected.\n\nIn addition to imaging, the participants were tested for their executive and cognitive function using the Trail Making Test, a tool used to help detect cognitive impairments associated with dementia and test a person’s brain processing speed and function. The researchers found that those who had the greatest brain tissue loss also performed the worst on this exam.\n\nAlthough the areas of the brain most affected appear to be related to the olfactory system, Douaud said it wasn’t clear why that was the case.\n\n“Since the abnormal changes we see in the infected participants’ brains might be partly related to their loss of smell, it is possible that recovering it might lead to these brain abnormalities becoming less marked over time. Similarly, it is likely that the harmful effects of the virus (whether direct, or indirect via inflammatory or immune reactions) decrease over time after infection. The best way to find out would be to scan these participants again in one or two years’ time,” she said.\n\nDouaud added that the researchers anticipate reimaging and testing the participants in one or two years.\n\nAnd while the study finds some association between infection and brain function, it’s still not clear why. Previous studies have shown people with significant and repeated loss of smell also have an associated loss of gray matter.

Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.\n\nIn the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\n\n“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”\n\nIQAir\n\nAbove: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.\n\nIt’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nPM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nMillions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.\n\nIQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.\n\nIn the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.\n\n“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.\n\nResearchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”\n\nClimate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.\n\nChina — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.\n\nThe report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.\n\n“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.\n\nThe report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.\n\n“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.\n\nHammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.\n\nTarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\n\n“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.\n\nHammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\n\n“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/12/parking-pain-causes-financial-and-personal-strain/467637001/", "title": "Drivers spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for parking ...", "text": "Searching for parking is more painful than ever for U.S. drivers.\n\nMotorists spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for spots on streets, in lots, or in garages, according to a report issued Wednesday.\n\nThe hunt adds up to an estimated $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel, and emissions, according to the analysis by INRIX, a leading specialist in connected car services and transportation analytics.\n\nOverpaying — caused by drivers' inability to estimate how long they need to park or forking over extra at a garage to avoid the risk of getting a parking ticket — costs Americans more than $20 billion a year or $97 per driver, the report estimated.\n\nHunting for parking \"imposes significant costs on our pocketbooks that we often don't think about,\" and also adds to (traffic) congestion,\" said Bob Pishue, an INRIX transportation analyst and co-author of the report. \"This is a problem not only drivers face, but local shops and businesses, too.\"\n\nMotorists in large cities endure the toughest challenges.\n\nIn New York City, the hardest-hit U.S. urban area, drivers on average spend 107 hours a year looking for parking spots, the report said.

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/health/us-life-expectancy-drops-again-2021/index.html", "title": "US life expectancy continues historic decline with another drop in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLife expectancy in the United States took another hit in 2021, furthering a dramatic decline from 2020 that was the largest since World War II, according to a new report.\n\nThe study – published Thursday on the preprint server medRxiv, which means it has not been peer-reviewed – found that after falling nearly 1.9 years in 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased another 0.4 years in 2021 as Covid-19 continued to spread.\n\n“Although the introduction and availability of effective vaccines were expected to curb US mortality rates in 2021, slow vaccine uptake and the spread of the Delta variant produced large surges in mortality,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWith a brief exception in the summer of 2021, Covid-19 has consistently been one of the top three causes of death for the past two years in the US, an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows.\n\nIn the decade before the pandemic, life expectancy in the US changed by an average of less than 0.1 years annually, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nChanges to life expectancy amid the Covid-19 pandemic widened an existing gap between the US and other high-income countries, the new report shows.

It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-author Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017 at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter.

For example, the research team asked questions about smoking level, amount of physical activity, education level and dietary habits, Wee said.\n\nThere is a limit to the researchers’ adjustments because they didn’t ask about other factors that could affect the results like income level and occupation, she said.\n\nPay attention to added sugar\n\nIf you drink sugar-laden lattes and caramel macchiatos, you’re out of luck.\n\nThe average coffee drinker who reported they sweeten their coffee put in an average of 1 teaspoon, according to the study.\n\n“If you’re only adding about 1 teaspoon of sugar to your coffee, the benefits of coffee that we think are there aren’t completely negated by that 1 teaspoon,” Wee said.\n\nThe results for people who used artificial sweetener in their coffee were less clear, so the researchers were not able to draw any conclusions for people who prefer sugar substitutes.\n\n“Based on this study, clinicians can tell their patients that there is no need for most coffee drinkers to eliminate the beverage from their diet but to be cautious about higher calorie specialty coffees,” lead study author Dr. Dan Liu in an email. She is from the department of epidemiology at Southern Medical University in Guangzhou, China.\n\nHow does coffee affect the body?\n\nPrevious research has shown that coffee intake could protect the heart and aid in treating other diseases, Liu said. It may also reduce the risk of liver problems, a 2021 study said.\n\nCoffee also has different health profiles, depending on how it’s produced, said Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.\n\nSome types contain phenolic compounds, which are believed to be beneficial, he said.\n\nThose chemical compounds affect the flavor and aroma of the coffee and are valuable because they can act as antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties.\n\nThe two most common coffee species are arabica and robusta, and research shows robusta coffee has a higher phenolic content than arabica coffee.\n\nUnroasted, green coffee beans contain high levels of phenolic compounds, but the poor aroma when they are brewed causes people to roast them. Depending on the roasting level, some of the phenolic compounds can break down.\n\nAnd depending on how you brew it, coffee can contain high levels of diterpenes, which are chemical compounds that can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, Kuhnle said.\n\nBoiled coffee and French press coffee contain some of the highest amounts of diterpenes, according to a 2016 study.\n\nMocha and espresso coffee contained a moderate amount of diterpenes while instant coffees or coffees made with filtration had the least.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}]}

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nIn addition, how coffee is brewed can also affect its benefits for health. Filtered coffee catches a compound called cafestol that exists in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/health/alcohol-brain-shrinkage-wellness/index.html", "title": "One drink per day can shrink your brain, study says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust one pint of beer or average glass of wine a day may begin to shrink the overall volume of the brain, a new study has found, and the damage worsens as the number of daily drinks rises.\n\nOn average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine (two alcohol units) a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank a half of a beer (one unit), according to the study, which published Friday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe brains of people that age who said they drank three alcohol units a day had reductions in both white and gray matter that looked as if they had added 3.5 years to the ages of their brains.\n\nOne alcohol unit is 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure alcohol. That means 25 milliliters or a single shot of liquor is one unit; a 16-ounce can of beer or cider is two units; and a standard 6-ounce glass of wine (175 milliliters) is two units.\n\nThe brains of nondrinkers who began consuming an average of one alcohol unit a day showed the equivalent of a half a year of aging, according to the study.\n\nIn comparison, drinking four alcohol units a day aged a person’s brain by more than 10 years.\n\n“It’s not linear. It gets worse the more you drink,” first author Remi Daviet, an assistant professor of marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.\n\n“A problem in this study is that they only have information on people’s drinking habits for the one year prior to the (brain) imaging,” said alcohol researcher Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\n“I think this is a major limitation of the study as it’s likely that the cumulative consumption of alcohol throughout one’s lifetime is associated with the brain, not just the level of consumption right before the images were taken,” she added.\n\n“The relationship between alcohol and health is complex, and our understanding of that relationship is evolving over time. Based on this study, I would not really draw any definitive conclusions, but I would say that the authors have identified areas for further research.”\n\nBenefits of alcohol?\n\nDoctors used to believe that moderate amounts of alcohol could provide a health benefit, especially to the heart and the brain, but recent research has called that assumption into question. A number of studies have found no amount of drinking to be healthy, and the World Heart Federation recently published a policy brief saying there is “no level of alcohol consumption that is safe for health.”\n\n“Small amounts of alcohol are associated with health benefits for some conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes, but harmful for others, such as road traffic accidents and breast cancer,” Gakidou said, adding there are others, such as a stroke, where the outcome isn’t clear.\n\n“There isn’t really a simple answer for a given individual,” she said. “Based on what we do know at this time, whether small amounts of alcohol are beneficial or harmful for an individual depends on that person’s health status and their risk profile. … Are they more prone to heart disease or cancer?”\n\nBrain scans and large study size\n\nThe report analyzed data from more than 36,000 people who took part in the UK Biobank study, which houses in-depth genetic and health information on more than 500,000 middle-aged adults living in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople in the study had provided information on the number of drinks they had each week in the previous year and had undergone an MRI brain scan. Researchers compared their scans with images of typical aging brains and then controlled for such variables as age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry and overall head size.\n\n“The fact that we have such a large sample size allows us to find subtle patterns, even between drinking the equivalent of half a beer and one beer a day,” coauthor Gideon Nave, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.\n\n“Having this dataset is like having a microscope or a telescope with a more powerful lens,” Nave said. “You get a better resolution and start seeing patterns and associations you couldn’t before.”\n\nHe told CNN that is why this study was able to find a more distinct pattern of association between drinking and brain volume than past studies. However, he added, the results are just that – an association – as the study could not prove cause and effect.\n\n“Our study is by far the largest investigation of the topic,” Nave said. “It uses a general population sample, and it controls for more confounds than before. As such, it provides overwhelmingly more evidence than any previous investigations and gets us closer to settling the debate.”\n\nHowever, the study left a number of questions unanswered, such as a person’s cognitive engagement, Gakidou said.\n\n“I believe that there is sufficient evidence that suggests that brain function decays faster among those that are not engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, either through work or hobbies,” she said.\n\n“My main criticism is that the authors are overinterpreting the findings of their study and drawing conclusions that are not necessarily supported by what is presented in the paper.

It found that the brains of those who had Covid-19 had a greater loss of gray matter and abnormalities in the brain tissue compared with those who didn’t have Covid-19. Many of those changes were in the area of the brain related to the sense of smell.\n\n“We were quite surprised to see clear differences in the brain even with mild infection,” lead author Gwenaëlle Douaud, an associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Oxford, told CNN in an email.\n\nDouaud and her colleagues evaluated brain imaging from 401 people who had Covid-19 between March 2020 and April 2021, both before infection and an average of 4½ months after infection. They compared the results with brain imaging of 384 uninfected people similar in age, socioeconomics and risk factors such as blood pressure and obesity. Of the 401 infected people, 15 had been hospitalized.\n\nThe 785 participants were between the ages of 51 and 81 and were all part of the UK Biobank, an ongoing government health database of 500,000 people begun in 2012.\n\nDouaud explained that it is normal for people to lose 0.2% to 0.3% of gray matter every year in the memory-related areas of the brain as they age, but in the study evaluation, people who had been infected with the coronavirus lost an additional 0.2% to 2% of tissue compared with those who hadn’t been infected.\n\nIn addition to imaging, the participants were tested for their executive and cognitive function using the Trail Making Test, a tool used to help detect cognitive impairments associated with dementia and test a person’s brain processing speed and function. The researchers found that those who had the greatest brain tissue loss also performed the worst on this exam.\n\nAlthough the areas of the brain most affected appear to be related to the olfactory system, Douaud said it wasn’t clear why that was the case.\n\n“Since the abnormal changes we see in the infected participants’ brains might be partly related to their loss of smell, it is possible that recovering it might lead to these brain abnormalities becoming less marked over time. Similarly, it is likely that the harmful effects of the virus (whether direct, or indirect via inflammatory or immune reactions) decrease over time after infection. The best way to find out would be to scan these participants again in one or two years’ time,” she said.\n\nDouaud added that the researchers anticipate reimaging and testing the participants in one or two years.\n\nAnd while the study finds some association between infection and brain function, it’s still not clear why. Previous studies have shown people with significant and repeated loss of smell also have an associated loss of gray matter. However, this study did not evaluate whether people actually had a loss of smell.\n\nThe authors cautioned that the findings were only of a moment in time but noted that they “raise the possibility that longer-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection might in time contribute to Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.”\n\nThe findings were noticeable, but they weren’t enough to cause alarm, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist and director of the Florida Atlantic University Center for Brain Health. Isaacson was not involved in the study.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIsaacson said the findings were noticeable for clinicians, but he added that the overall impact on individuals was difficult to determine and could be small. “It’s really hard to know the long-term clinical impact and quality of life impact in a situation like this,” he said.\n\n“The brain may be affected by other mechanisms such as immune, inflammatory, vascular or psychological/behavioral change but not direct infection,” said Dr. Alan Carson, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the Center for Clinical Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“What this study almost certainly shows is the impact, in terms of neural changes,” he said. “But I don’t think it helps us understand the mechanisms underpinning cognitive change after Covid infection.”", "authors": ["Nadia Kounang"], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/world/air-pollution-2021-iqair-report-climate/index.html", "title": "IQAir report shows the best and worst places for air quality in 2021 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAir pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report.\n\nThe report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.\n\nOnly 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.\n\nThe Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times.\n\nIn the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021.\n\n“This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.”\n\nIQAir\n\nAbove: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir.\n\nIt’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter.\n\nPM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.\n\nMillions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths.\n\nIQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories.\n\nIn the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed.\n\n“The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote.\n\nResearchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.\n\n“We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”\n\nClimate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.\n\nChina — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city.\n\nThe report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.\n\n“This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.\n\nThe report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.\n\n“When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.\n\nHammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.\n\nTarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports.\n\n“I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.”\n\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.\n\nHammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel.\n\n“We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/12/parking-pain-causes-financial-and-personal-strain/467637001/", "title": "Drivers spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for parking ...", "text": "Searching for parking is more painful than ever for U.S. drivers.\n\nMotorists spend an average of 17 hours a year searching for spots on streets, in lots, or in garages, according to a report issued Wednesday.\n\nThe hunt adds up to an estimated $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel, and emissions, according to the analysis by INRIX, a leading specialist in connected car services and transportation analytics.\n\nOverpaying — caused by drivers' inability to estimate how long they need to park or forking over extra at a garage to avoid the risk of getting a parking ticket — costs Americans more than $20 billion a year or $97 per driver, the report estimated.\n\nHunting for parking \"imposes significant costs on our pocketbooks that we often don't think about,\" and also adds to (traffic) congestion,\" said Bob Pishue, an INRIX transportation analyst and co-author of the report. \"This is a problem not only drivers face, but local shops and businesses, too.\"\n\nMotorists in large cities endure the toughest challenges.\n\nIn New York City, the hardest-hit U.S. urban area, drivers on average spend 107 hours a year looking for parking spots, the report said.

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/health/us-life-expectancy-drops-again-2021/index.html", "title": "US life expectancy continues historic decline with another drop in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLife expectancy in the United States took another hit in 2021, furthering a dramatic decline from 2020 that was the largest since World War II, according to a new report.\n\nThe study – published Thursday on the preprint server medRxiv, which means it has not been peer-reviewed – found that after falling nearly 1.9 years in 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased another 0.4 years in 2021 as Covid-19 continued to spread.\n\n“Although the introduction and availability of effective vaccines were expected to curb US mortality rates in 2021, slow vaccine uptake and the spread of the Delta variant produced large surges in mortality,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWith a brief exception in the summer of 2021, Covid-19 has consistently been one of the top three causes of death for the past two years in the US, an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows.\n\nIn the decade before the pandemic, life expectancy in the US changed by an average of less than 0.1 years annually, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nChanges to life expectancy amid the Covid-19 pandemic widened an existing gap between the US and other high-income countries, the new report shows. Among a set of 19 peer countries, life expectancy dropped only a third as much as in the US in 2020 (down 0.6 years, on average) and rebounded in 2021, with an average increase of about 0.3 years.\n\nLife expectancy in the US fell from 78.9 years in 2019 to 76.6 years in 2021 – now more than five years less than the average among peer nations.\n\n“This speaks volumes about the life consequences of how the US handled the pandemic,” Dr. Steven Woolf, study author and director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, said in a statement. “What happened in the U.S. is less about the variants than the levels of resistance to vaccination and the public’s rejection of practices, such as masking and mandates, to reduce viral transmission.”\n\nIn the US, there was a disproportionate decrease in life expectancy for Black and Hispanic people in 2020.

It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-author Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017 at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter.

The scientists then looked up death certificates to see who had passed away an average of seven years later.\n\nThe participants ranged in age from 37 to 73 years old and reported they had no cardiovascular disease or cancer at the time of the survey.\n\nResults showed that for people who drank a moderate amount of coffee, defined as 1.5 to 3.5 cups a day, those who sweetened their coffee had about a 30% lower death risk compared with non-coffee drinkers, according to Dr. Christina Wee, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. She is also deputy editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nUnsweetened coffee drinkers had between 16% and 29% lower death risk compared with non-coffee drinkers, she added.\n\nThe findings were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical factors to eliminate their effects on the results.

He was not involved in the study.\n\nSome types contain phenolic compounds, which are believed to be beneficial, he said.\n\nThose chemical compounds affect the flavor and aroma of the coffee and are valuable because they can act as antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties.\n\nThe two most common coffee species are arabica and robusta, and research shows robusta coffee has a higher phenolic content than arabica coffee.\n\nUnroasted, green coffee beans contain high levels of phenolic compounds, but the poor aroma when they are brewed causes people to roast them. Depending on the roasting level, some of the phenolic compounds can break down.\n\nAnd depending on how you brew it, coffee can contain high levels of diterpenes, which are chemical compounds that can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, Kuhnle said.\n\nBoiled coffee and French press coffee contain some of the highest amounts of diterpenes, according to a 2016 study.\n\nMocha and espresso coffee contained a moderate amount of diterpenes while instant coffees or coffees made with filtration had the least.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}]}

The Ukrainian government is downplaying the immediate risks of a full-scale invasion, even as officials on all sides scramble to find a diplomatic solution of a standoff that the Biden administration warns is precariously close to war.\n\nIf an incursion does occur, it is unclear what form it would take – and predicting the intentions of Russian President Vladimir Putin is a notoriously unwise exercise. “Any contemporary warfare would be horrifying, but there are gradations to the horror,” said Nigel Gould-Davies, a former British ambassador to Belarus who is now senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) think tank.\n\nThe effectiveness of a NATO-led response is also crucial in determining how long and far-reaching the impacts of any invasion would be, analysts agree.\n\nBut any Russian move would carry a test of Western nations’ resolve and pose a series of economic and security uncertainties.\n\n“This is easily the most serious security crisis in Europe since the 1980s,” Gould-Davies said.\n\n“Russia and the West have disagreed so fundamentally on worldview and that fundamental disagreement has been swept under the carpet for years,” added James Nixey, director of the Russia-Eurasia program at London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\n“Now Russia has decided it’s going to up the ante,” he said. “It is a real-world problem that has global implications.”\n\nA new frontline in Europe\n\nAs the threat of a Russian move into Ukraine has grown, so too has the volume of the West’s rhetoric.\n\nUS President Joe Biden told CNN Tuesday there would be “severe consequences” over any Russian invasion. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country would contribute to any new NATO deployment in the wake of an attack, while French President Emmanuel Macron said the “the cost will be very high” if Putin decides to move.\n\nBut the “scale of the global reaction depends on the extent of Russia’s insertion into Ukraine,” Nixey said. He added that while many observers are cautiously optimistic that an all-out war will be averted, “I’ve been wrong before – as most Russia analysts have.”\n\nThe most immediate consequences beyond Ukraine would be felt in the eastern European and Baltic states which would find an openly bellicose Russia on their doorsteps.\n\n“Ukraine borders several NATO states. There will be a great deal of concern that this is not just something happening nearby that could have spillover effects – but that their security would be threatened,” Gould-Davies said.\n\nUkrainian soldiers in a front line trench position in Donbas take shelter from the extreme cold. Timothy Fadek/Redux for CNN\n\n“If Russia is allowed, or not discouraged from, re-drawing borders yet again, then quite clearly Russia will take lessons from that itself – where next?,” added Nixey.\n\nMuch would then depend on the NATO response, and countries that could find themselves in the firing line would quickly notice an increased troop presence. As many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened alert for a possible deployment to eastern Europe, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday. Three US officials familiar with the discussions also told CNN that the United States and allies could send extra deployments to Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary in the coming days.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and the alliance would likely not send soldiers into the country. But following an incursion, a heavy troop presence would likely remain along Europe’s eastern rim for as long as Russia held Ukrainian land – a prospect that would rekindle memories of a Cold War-era barrier splitting east from west.\n\n“There is going to have to be a response all along that NATO front line that acts as a deterrent … and you have to have a whole war-fighting strategy around that,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).\n\n“In Europe, this would change things enormously – because we’re so far from thinking in those terms,” he added. Melvin predicted that nations would require “large enough forces to fight for a long period, to bring in new forces from the US, [and] to fight cyber dimensions.”\n\n“It’s going to be a huge shift.”\n\nEconomic worries\n\nThe economic fallout of an invasion is wrought with unknowns, but there are several possible knock-on effects that have worried experts since the buildup of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border first became clear.\n\nMost directly, a disruption to Ukraine’s agricultural production could have a direct impact on food supply.\n\nThe country is one of the world’s four major grain exporters – it is expected to account for around a sixth of the world’s corn imports in the next five years, according to projections by the International Grains Council – so a direct hit to its production and output could impact the supply of certain foodstuffs.\n\nBut more concerning is the wider potential impact on energy supplies, and the consequences of tough Western sanctions on Russia that would be expected after an incursion.\n\n“If you’re talking about a major conflict [involving] one of the biggest energy suppliers in the world – and a major transit country to the rest of Europe – then there can’t not be significant impacts on energy markets,” Gould-Davies said.\n\nRussia provides around 30% of the European Union’s natural gas, with supplies from the country playing a vital role in power generation and home heating across central and eastern Europe.\n\nIt has already been accused of exploiting that reliance; the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that Russia has contributed to an undersupply of gas in Europe by reducing its exports, and in recent months the country has put supply pressure on Moldova as well.\n\n“We’ve seen Russia in recent months exploit and exacerbate the problems of global energy supply and higher prices,” Gould-Davies added. “Could they contemplate the cost of something much more serious than this?”\n\nInflation in energy costs has already hit millions of homes in Europe – in Britain, consumers will pay roughly £790 ($1,075) more to heat and light their homes this year, according to Bank of America – and conflict in eastern Europe could spark or deepen cost of living crises in several countries.\n\nOne worry in Europe is that Russia would indeed be willing to handle a rupture with the European market, given its gradual pivot of gas and coal supplies to China in recent years.\n\nAn acceleration in that shift would cause “an enormous jolt on [Europe’s] economy, because they’re going to have to do something else,” said Melvin. This could potentially stall plans for a nuclear phase-out in parts of the continent if nations are forced to frantically reach for energy alternatives.\n\nThe Biden administration has been conducting contingency planning to shore up Europe’s energy supplies should Russia invade, anticipating gas shortages and a shock to the global economy, senior administration officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe EU is meanwhile working on a “wide array of sectoral and individual sanctions” in case of further Russian aggression, according to a European Commission statement that followed a virtual meeting with the leaders of the US, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, Poland, the EU and NATO. Biden told CNN he would anticipate “significant economic sanctions.”\n\nA convoy of Russian armored vehicles moves along a highway in Crimea earlier this month. AP\n\nAnalysts generally expect a wide-ranging package of sanctions that could hit major Russian banks, the oil and gas sector, and technology imports. But the effects on Europe and the rest of the world would be felt, too.\n\n“Any time you impose sanctions, you impose great costs on the target – but you also have the risk of blowback harms on yourself and on your friends and allies,” said Nathan Sales, an acting undersecretary for civilian security, democracy, and human rights at the US State Department during the Trump administration.\n\nAnd while targeted sanctions on Russian individuals and companies have been relied on since Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, there is still “a substantial investment relationship” between the country and the West that could be ruptured, Melvin said.\n\n“The question now is how much further would those sanctions go, and how much more isolated the Russian economy would become,” he added.\n\nA watching world\n\nExperts said the reverberations of an incursion, and more pertinently the strength of the Western response, will be felt worldwide. Some fear that any Russian move that it could chalk up as a victory could encourage other nations engaged in border disputes.\n\n“China will be watching carefully for lessons that it can draw about Western resolve,” Gould-Davies said. “The Taiwanese are going to draw lessons from that – as is anybody in a border despite, living next to a vastly superior leader,” agreed Nixey. Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately since the end of the Chinese civil war more than 70 years ago, but China’s ruling Chinese Community Party (CCP) sees the island as part of its territory and has not ruled out military force to take it.\n\nThat context is underscoring a sense in some quarters that the US response to the Ukraine crisis could dictate how it is viewed around the world for a generation.\n\n“We would be seeing knock-on effects for years and maybe decades to come” if Russia orchestrates a successful move, Sales said. “That is going to tell dictators around the world that the US is a paper tiger.”\n\nHe cited “rogue regimes like North Korea and Iran” as other nations that could seek to capitalize on such an outcome. But Sales added there also exists “a scenario where the US and NATO come out of this crisis with their credibility enhanced,” should a strong response initiate a Russian climbdown.\n\nShould lengthy tensions follow a Russian incursion, a debate could also be renewed in the US about what role the country should play in Europe. “They have a very stark political divide now between a global policeman role, which Biden has advocated, or the other camp that we only do what’s in the US interests,” said Melvin.\n\nThough many implications of a Russian move into Ukraine remain far from certain, there is one thing experts can agree on. “In international politics, everyone is always watching everyone else,” Gould-Davies said.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl/index.html", "title": "Peace in Europe 'shattered' as Russia invades Ukraine | CNN", "text": "Moscow and Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia has launched an unprecedented military assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea that has already left dozens dead, prompting Western leaders to condemn Moscow and vow unity with Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a “full-scale invasion” of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s.

And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” said Biden.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war” and said it put “countless innocent lives” at risk.\n\n“Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,” he said. “NATO allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.

The Russian claim of a need to “denazify” Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish.\n\nThe Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government.\n\n“Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,” he said, but threatened “those who may be tempted to intervene” on Ukraine’s behalf.\n\n“Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,” he said.\n\nResidents refuel at a gas station in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.

At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nZelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing “exceptionally” in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine’s north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did seize the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the scene of Europe’s worst nuclear disaster.\n\nUkraine’s borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service.

The trip raised concerns in Europe. Here's why.\n\nDiplomatic coup?\n\nPoland has one of the most right-wing governments in Europe. The ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) has a broad, anti-liberal agenda that opposition parties, the European Union and others allege is endangering the ex-communist country's young democracy. PiS has sought to limit the ability of the courts to operate independently, crack down on dissenting media and pursue conservative polices on abortion and gay rights. Poland refuses to accept Syrian refugees based on EU quotas.\n\nPoland's leadership sees Trump's visit as a diplomatic coup because it indicates tacit approval for its policies, and comes before he meets with leaders of staunch U.S. allies Britain, France and Germany. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party leader of the PiS, called Trump's visit a success that other allies \"envy.\"\n\nMore heat on climate\n\nAs part of his visit to Warsaw, Trump will meet with President Andrzej Duda and deliver a speech at the Three Seas Conference, a forum convened by Poland for Central European, Baltic and Western Balkan countries to find ways to boost trade and cooperate on infrastructure projects. A key talking point will be how these countries can reduce the region's dependence on Russian energy. Poland already has begun importing more liquefied natural gas from the United States, and Trump will almost certainly use his address to boast about the benefits for American business.\n\nHowever, he may also use the speech to claim that the U.S. is not alone in its disapproval of the Paris accord to combat global warming, from which he withdrew the U.S. in June. Poland, one of the largest greenhouse-gas emitters in the region, has found the move from coal to clean energy difficult and clashed with the EU over global-warming mitigation laws. \"It's a controversial visit,\" said Małgorzata Bonikowska of the Warsaw-based think tank Center for International Relations (CIR). \"It could be read as a signal that the U.S. feels closer to Poland than to its EU partners. PiS sees Trump as a strong, right-wing leader who is taking the U.S. to the right place.\"\n\nPoland, you're OK\n\nTrump often criticizes NATO members for failing to meet the military alliance's 2% of GDP defense spending goal. In Poland, he won't have to. It is one of just five out of 29 NATO countries that meet the alliance's goal. Germany, which hosts the G-20 summit, has been on the receiving end of Trump's complaints.\n\nWhite House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Trump will deliver a \"major\" foreign policy speech in Warsaw's Krasinski Square that will \"praise Polish courage\" and its \"emergence as a European power.\"\n\nBut the choice of Krasinski Square is not without some symbolism: It was at the heart of Poland's 1944 failed uprising against Nazi German occupation and its choice of location could be interpreted as an attempt by Trump to publicly remind Germany of its dark past. At the same time, Poland hopes the U.S. leader reaffirms a commitment to NATO's doctrine of collective defense if any member is attacked — a pledge Trump would not make in May at a NATO summit in Brussels .\n\nMake Poland great again\n\nBonikowska of the CIS said the Polish government would make sure that large cheering crowds are on hand for Trump's visit and his speech in Krasinski Square , which will be broadcast live on Polish television. She said the country is divided over Trump's presidency, like in the U.S., with some admiring his outspokenness and others viewing him as arrogant.\n\nMateusz Klinowski, mayor of a Polish town who has come under pressure from the government for attempting to resettle refugees, said Poland's ruling party is made up of ultra-populists \"who come from the same soup\" as Trump's America First nationalism. \"They have the same view of the world.

What caused the explosions remains unclear.\n\nIn a speech following the incident, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war “began with Crimea and must end with Crimea – its liberation.”​\n\nAnother set of explosions were reported in Crimea this week, on August 16, this time at an ammunition depot in Maiske and at an airfield in Gvardeyskoe.\n\nRussian officials said the incident in Maiske had been the result of sabotage​, but they did not specify the kind of sabotage, or whom they believed was responsible.\n\nWhat do we know about other recent incidents?\n\nOn Tuesday, a fire and smoke plume were seen rising from an electrical substation 12 miles away from Maiske’s ammunition depot, according to social media footage. The cause of the fire, and smoke, at the substation remains unclear.\n\nThe incidents both took place around the Dzhankoi area, described by the British Ministry of Defence as “a key road and rail junction that plays an important role in supplying Russia’s operations in southern Ukraine.”\n\nSmoke rises from an electric substation in Crimea on Tuesday. Str/Reuters\n\nThe attacks come at a time when nascent resistance movement in Russian occupied areas appears to have been carrying out acts of sabotage.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian officials said that a railway bridge near the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, used by Russians to transport military equipment and weapons from occupied Crimea, was blown up by Ukrainian partisans. Melitopol has for months been a center of underground resistance to Russian occupation.\n\nAs analysts speculate that there is a campaign to degrade Russia’s military capability in Crimea, Zelensky warned Ukrainians living in occupied areas on Tuesday to stay clear of Russian forces’ military facilities.\n\nWhat do the blasts mean for Putin’s ambitions?\n\nThe explosions at Saki airbase jolted sunbathers lounging in beach-side cabanas last week, and marked the start of a series of mysterious incidents on the Ukrainian peninsula that threatens the jewel of President Vladimir Putin’s revanchist ambitions.\n\nWestern officials and analysts have since offered competing explanations about the cause.\n\nIn any event, the Cavell Group said, the “Saki attack was audacious and highly effective in both damaging Russian reinforcements and striking a significant psychological blow to morale amongst the Russian military and civilians.”\n\nA mushroom cloud of smoke can be seen in the distance, scaring beachgoers in Crimea last week. From Telegram/From VK\n\nWhatever caused the explosions, they could have significant implications for the overall conflict, especially if the attack were to have been carried out with any new long-range weapon system that Ukraine has developed.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence says that the loss of combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war.\n\nBut it noted that Saki is the main base for supporting the Russian navy in the Black Sea. “The fleet’s naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded. The incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception,” it said.\n\nIt may also cause a re-evaluation of the threat to Crimea which “has probably been seen as a secure rear-area,” the ministry said.\n\nWhy is Crimea so important to Putin?\n\nCrimea is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which is based at Sevastopol. The peninsula has acted as a launching pad for the February invasion, with Russian troops pouring into Ukraine’s south from the annexed region.\n\nControl of Crimea assures Russia continuing access to the Sevastopol naval base, which it previously operated under a leasing deal with Ukraine that was scrapped after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Surrounded by the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, ships and submarines based in Crimea are just north of Turkey and can reach the Mediterranean to influence the Middle East and the Balkans.\n\nCrimea was forcibly seized by Russia in 2014 – soon after Ukrainian protesters helped topple pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych – when thousands of Russian special-operations troops wearing unmarked uniforms deployed around the peninsula in early March that year.\n\nTwo weeks later, Russia completed its annexation of Crimea in a referendum, slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate, and at the time considered the biggest land-grab on Europe since World War II.\n\nSince annexation, human-rights observers have described Crimea’s descent into a police state, with local authorities and Russian security services persecuting and arresting those perceived to be loyal to Ukraine, including members of the Crimean Tatar community. A 2020 US State Deparment report described a pattern of “unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by Russia or Russia-led “authorities”; forced disappearances by Russia or Russia-led “authorities”; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment” in Crimea.\n\nEven before annexation, nationalist Russian politicians often made claims to the region – with its rich farmland and its access to the Black Sea – part of their populist rhetoric, even though Russia was just one of a number of powers to have dominated Crimea over the centuries. One particular nationalist grievance was the Soviet leadership’s decision to transfer the administration of Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, when both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union.\n\nPutin also capitalized on those sentiments.\n\n“In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,” Putin told Russian lawmakers as he announced the annexation in 2014.\n\nCrimea has long been a popular spot for Russian vacationers and for the Soviet elite. In 1991, the Soviet Union’s last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was vacationing in the region when hardliners launched a coup against him.\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia has affected tourism in the region. Sergei Aksyonov, the head of the Russian-controlled Crimean administration, acknowledged last month that a 40% decline in the tourism industry was expected over the summer. The Russian Tourism Association made a similar prediction in June.\n\nDespite Moscow’s claims, domestic politics may have played a part in Putin’s decision to annex the region. Despite an economic crisis in Russia, nationalistic rhetoric and Crimea’s invasion saw Putin’s approval ratings climb in 2014\n\nWhat’s happened in Crimea after the blasts?\n\nThe Russian road state agency on Tuesday reported a new traffic record across a Crimean bridge just days after the explosions at Saki airbase.\n\n“During the day on August 15, 38,297 cars drove across the bridge in both directions,” the statement read.\n\nLocal officials have downplayed the size of the lines saying they were the result of stricter controls on the bridge for security reasons and not because of an increase in outward traffic.\n\n“From the point of view that they are fleeing Crimea, this is a complete lie, there is no doubt about it,” Aksyonov, the head of the Russian-controlled Crimean administration, told Russian state TV on Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, in reference to the miles-long tailbacks of civilian vehicles attempted to leave Crimea for Russia, Zelensky said: “The queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia via the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them.”", "authors": ["Vasco Cotovio Tara John", "Vasco Cotovio", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Kyiv hit with 'cruise or ballistic missiles' as Russia attempts to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nExplosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists.\n\n“This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. “This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”\n\nEarlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.\n\nCNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well – as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.\n\n“Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,” the armed forces said.\n\nRussian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But “Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,” he said.\n\nRussia’s military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a “successful landing operation” to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv’s outskirts.\n\nZelensky’s comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”\n\nBefore dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.\n\n“Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,” Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON INVASION\n\nUkrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022. DANIEL LEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: “Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.”\n\nCNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition – apparently heading towards Obolon.\n\nMeanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world’s worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.\n\nAs Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.\n\nHowever, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made “limited progress” Friday in its attack.\n\n“Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,” the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted.\n\nA senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have “about a third of their combat power” in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country’s borders right now, but “that does not mean that they will not commit more.”\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.\n\nA Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022. It was unclear what aircraft crashed and what brought it down. Oleksandr Ratushniak/AP\n\nFor now, Ukraine’s democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that “enemy sabotage groups” had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said.\n\n“Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,” he said. “Such attacks on our capital haven’t occurred since 1941.”\n\nIn an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were “showing their true heroism” but that they were defending their country “alone.” The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are “not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,” he said.\n\nA few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. “There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” he said, speaking in Russian.\n\nShortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.\n\n“As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,” Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern “neutral status,” he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.\n\nZelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.\n\n“Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,” Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called “claims that we have refused to negotiate.”\n\nMeanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine’s armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.\n\n“Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,” Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. “Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”\n\nPutin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a “Nazi” or “fascist” regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.\n\nAsked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow’s plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: “Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being “simply crazy” in wanting to “come here to kill Ukrainians” – and vowed they would resist. “We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,” he said.\n\nA photograph taken on February 24, 2022 shows an Ukrainian infantry combat vehicle standing guard on the outskirts of Kyiv. DANIEL LEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHomes damaged\n\nThe advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions – and questions about Putin’s wider ambitions for the country and its capital.\n\nIt’s unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.\n\nTwo residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it’s not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.\n\nSeparately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.\n\nAs they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.\n\nOutside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.\n\nA CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.\n\nLow-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.\n\nA Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a “counter-offensive” was underway in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.\n\nMakeshift bunkers\n\nOfficials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.\n\nThose fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he’s “convinced” Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.\n\nIf that happens, Blinken said he believes “Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people.”\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine’s figures.\n\nBy the end of Thursday, Putin’s forces had launched “in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,” a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.\n\nA family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday.

The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia’s actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.\n\nPolish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.\n\nPeople hide in a bomb shelter in Kyiv in the early hours of February 25. Sergei Chuzavkov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSanctioning Putin\n\nThe United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.\n\nThe EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have “maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.”\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.\n\n“We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war.”\n\nThe alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.\n\n“We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,” Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have “deployed thousands more troops” to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.\n\nA big concern for NATO is whether Putin’s intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members – including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany – into a wider conflict on European soil.\n\n“You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,” said Blinken on CBS Evening News.\n\nBlinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin’s ultimate goals.\n\n“Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders. There’s something very powerful standing in his way. That’s article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,” the top diplomat said.\n\nOn Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge Matthew Chance Tim Lister Laura Smith-Spark Helen Regan", "Nathan Hodge", "Matthew Chance", "Tim Lister", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}]}

Thursday’s ruling “severely burdens States’ efforts” to curb gun violence, Breyer wrote.\n\n“The primary difference between the Court’s view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows States to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described,” Breyer wrote. “I fear that the Court’s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves States without the ability to address them.”\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, pushed back: “And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”\n\nThe conservative justices also dismissed concerns defenders of New York’s gun law raised about how the law restricted the carrying of firearms into sensitive places.\n\n“It is true that people sometimes congregate in ‘sensitive places,’ and it is likewise true that law enforcement professionals are usually presumptively available in those locations. But expanding the category of ‘sensitive places’ simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of ‘sensitive places’ far too broadly,” Thomas wrote.\n\nFirst major ruling on guns in a decade\n\nSince handing down two major Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the court has largely dodged the issue but agreed to take up the dispute after Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived, highlighting her impact on the new conservative court.\n\nIn 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms at home for self-defense. Except for a follow-up decision two years later, the justices largely stayed away from the issue infuriating gun rights advocates and even some of the justices themselves.\n\nThomas and other conservatives have made clear they believe lower courts have been thumbing their noses at the Heller decision by upholding restrictions. “The Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court,” Thomas has previously said.\n\nThe case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, concerned a New York law governing licenses to carry concealed handguns in public for self-defense. It required a resident to obtain a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver and demonstrate that “proper cause” exists for the permit. Residents must show that they have a great need for the license and that they face a “special or unique danger to their life.”\n\nThe law requires applicants who want to carry a handgun in public without restriction to show an “actual and articulable” self-defense need, as opposed to one that is “speculative or specious.”\n\nA panel of judges on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals held that New York’s law did not violate the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Biden administration supported New York and told the Supreme Court in a brief that while the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, the right is “not absolute.”\n\nActing Solicitor General Brian Fletcher told the justices that the law was “firmly grounded” in the nation’s history.\n\nThe petitioners in the case were Robert Nash, Brandon Koch and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association – an NRA affiliate. They were represented by Paul Clement, a George W. Bush-era solicitor general who argued that that the Second Amendment ensures a right not just to “keep arms,” but to bear them.\n\nNash and Koch had passed the required background checks and obtained licenses to carry guns for hunting and target practice, but they had not been able to establish a special need for self-defense that is required under the law to receive an unrestricted license.\n\nClement argued that the law makes it almost impossible for an ordinary individual to obtain a license because the “proper cause” standard is so demanding and left to the “broad discretion” of the licensing officer.\n\n“Good, even impeccable, moral character plus a simple desire to exercise a fundamental right is,” Clement said, “not sufficient.” “Nor is living or being employed in a high crime area.”\n\nNash, for instance, requested to carry a handgun for self-defense after a string of robberies in his neighborhood. But he was denied because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense. Koch wanted a similar license, and he was able to cite his experience of participating in safety training courses. He too was denied.\n\nReaction\n\nGun rights groups touted the ruling as a win for Second Amendment rights and individuals’ rights to protect themselves, while gun safety advocates argued that the ruling would result in more gun violence.\n\nSeveral New York Democrats decried the ruling, including New York Gov.

Therefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time. CDC recommends that people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings.”\n\nThe developments added fresh confusion to masking policies nationwide, with several airlines and travel authorities quickly announcing Monday evening that masks are now optional. It is unclear if the Justice Department will seek an order halting the ruling and file an appeal.\n\nJust last week, the CDC extended this mask mandate through May 3. The masking requirement applied to airplanes, trains and other forms of public transportation.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Monday afternoon that it was a “disappointing” decision, and the Justice Department will make any determinations about a legal response.\n\nConfusion in wake of ruling\n\nIn the immediate wake of Mizelle’s ruling, Psaki told reporters that the White House wasn’t trying to “provoke uncertainty with passengers” by not providing an immediate response, but added that the administration continues to recommend that airline passengers continue to wear masks.\n\n“So, we would say to anyone sitting out there – we recommend you wear masks on the airplane and … as soon as we can provide an update from here, hopefully soon, we’ll provide that to all of you,” she said.\n\nFollowing the ruling, several US airlines – Delta, United and Southwest among them – said masks are now optional on their aircraft. In a statement, Alaska Airlines said that passengers whose behavior was “particularly egregious” over the past two years in objecting to the mandate will remain banned from flying on the airline, “even after the mask policy is rescinded.”\n\nAmtrak and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates DC’s Metro, also announced that they will no longer require masks for passengers and employees, though the state-owned and operated NJ Transit and the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority will keep their requirements.\n\nA Biden administration official familiar with the White House’s decision previously told CNN the goal of the extension was to gather more information and understanding of the BA.2 variant of the coronavirus. Covid-19 cases in the US are on the rise, leading universities and the City of Philadelphia to reimplement indoor mask mandates.\n\nUS Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said last week that part of the reason for the extension of the transportation mask mandate was because of rising Covid-19 cases and settings created by travel.\n\n“We bring a lot of people together in a closed setting for a prolonged period of time, and not everyone has the option to not travel,” Murthy said on SiriusXM’s Doctor Radio’s Doctor Radio Reports, giving examples such as traveling on a plane to see a sick mother or traveling for work to keep a job. “Because it’s not necessarily an optional setting for people and because, again, folks are together for a long period of time, that’s why the CDC has leaned into being cautious there and recommending that people continue to wear those masks.”\n\nJudge compares enforcement to ‘detention and quarantine’\n\nThe first part of the judge’s 59-page ruling turned on the meaning of the word “sanitation,” as it functions in the 1944 statute that gives the federal government the authority – in its efforts to combat communicable diseases – to issue regulations concerning “sanitation.”\n\nMizelle concluded that that the use of the word in the statute was limited to “measures that clean something.”\n\nJudge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle sworn in by Justice Clarence Thomas, This photo was tweeted by Laura Rosenbury, dean of the University of Florida's Levin College of Law, in October 2021. From Laura Rosenbury/Twitter\n\n“Wearing a mask cleans nothing,” she wrote. “At most, it traps virus droplets. But it neither ‘sanitizes’ the person wearing the mask nor ‘sanitizes’ the conveyance.”\n\nShe wrote that the mandate fell outside of the law because “the CDC required mask wearing as a measure to keep something clean – explaining that it limits the spread of COVID-19 through prevention, but never contending that it actively destroys or removes it.”\n\nMizelle suggested that the government’s implementation of the mandate – in which non-complying travelers are “forcibly removed from their airplane seats, denied board at the bus steps, and turned away at the train station doors” – was akin to “detention and quarantine,” which are not contemplated in the section of the law in question, she said.\n\n“As a result, the Mask Mandate is best understood not as sanitation, but as an exercise of the CDC’s power to conditionally release individuals to travel despite concerns that they may spread a communicable disease (and to detain or partially quarantine those who refuse),” she wrote. “But the power to conditionally release and detain is ordinarily limited to individuals entering the United States from a foreign country.”\n\nShe added that the mandate also did not fit with a section of the law that would allow for detention of a traveler if he was, upon examination, found to infected.\n\n“The Mask Mandate complies with neither of these subsections,” the judge said. “It applies to all travelers regardless of their origins or destinations and makes no attempt to sort based on their health.”\n\nMizelle added that, additionally, the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates the procedures the federal government must follow when implementing certain agency policies.\n\nThe Biden administration erred in failing to seek public notice and comment on the policy, she wrote. She also ruled that the mandate violates that APA’s prohibitions on “arbitrary” and “capricious” agency actions because the CDC had failed to adequately explain its reasoning for implementing the policy.\n\nMizelle was appointed to the federal court in late 2020 by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nHer confirmation in the days after the 2020 election was controversial and uniformly opposed by Democrats. A former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Mizelle was 33 at the time of her confirmation. She had been rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association for “the short time she has actually practiced law and her lack of meaningful trial experience.”\n\nPrevious lawsuits had failed\n\nOther lawsuits that have been filed targeting the mandate – and the directive to enforce it by the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration – have failed to succeed in blocking it.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department filing submitted last week in a separate lawsuit against mandate the brought in Texas, “many other individuals have sought time-sensitive injunctive relief from the CDC or TSA orders that require masks during commercial air travel.”\n\n“The Supreme Court has thrice rejected that relief, and so has every Court of Appeals to consider the issue – that is, the Fourth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits – as well as the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida,” the Justice Department said in that case, referring to an earlier lawsuit brought in Florida’s Middle District. “No court has granted such relief, and not a single Judge or Justice has noted their dissent from any of these orders.”\n\nUnlike those other cases where judges were weighing emergency or preliminary orders, Mizelle was considering the legality of the mandate on the merits.\n\nFlight attendants union urges ‘calm’\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, the Association of Flight Attendants urged “calm and consistency in the airports and on planes.”\n\n“We urge focus on clear communication so that Flight Attendants and other frontline workers are not subject to more violence created by uncertainty and confusion,” the union, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants, said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans cheered the ruling, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posting on Twitter that it was “Great to see a federal judge in Florida follow the law and reject the Biden transportation mask mandate.”\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter that the ruling showed why his work on Trump judicial nominations was “so important to protect [individual] liberty” and “restraining [government] overreach.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey, meanwhile, tweeted that a “Trump-appointed judge is obstructing our pandemic response and putting the most vulnerable at risk.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/republican-hypocrisy-nra-convention-houston/index.html", "title": "Key Republicans pull out of NRA forum as political pressure mounts ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEven some of the most pro-gun politicians in Texas are realizing the devastating political optics of appearing at a major gun lobby forum just days after a horrific school massacre.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans, canceled expected in-person appearances at the National Rifle Association-Institute for Legislative Action’s annual leadership forum on Friday. Abbott however is still expected to send a pre-recorded video. Former President Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who this week sparked controversy by accusing Democrats of politicizing the deaths of 19 children and two teachers in a mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, are still expected to attend.\n\nPlans to go ahead with the forum were heavily criticized by gun reform activists and local Democratic political leaders as disrespectful to the victims of the tragedy. Pulling out of the meeting is one thing. There is no suggestion so far that the GOP’s drive in Texas to loosen gun laws – a core platform of Republican Party policy, is likely to change.\n\nRepublicans habitually criticize Democrats for calling for gun control after America’s regular mass killings but many support the NRA – itself a highly politicized body that spent decades radicalizing the GOP on guns and tearing down moderate firearm laws. There are now many high-powered weapons in private hands – like the kind an 18-year-old gunman bought legally and used for his rampage in Uvalde on Tuesday. The group’s annual meetings are taking place in Houston only three days after and about 275 miles to the east of the spot where innocent children were gunned down in their classroom. The assault was both shocking in its barbarism but not at all surprising as it was just the latest mass shooting in America’s endless cycle of gun violence.\n\nThe NRA says it’s primarily an educational organization with a mission to promote responsible and safe gun ownership and to advocate for the constitutional right to own a firearm under the Second Amendment. Yet its lobbying arm has for years been extraordinarily influential, while its affiliated political arms pour millions of dollars into Republican campaigns and target candidates that advocate for tightening gun laws. Therefore, the charge by some of the politicians attending the forum that only Democrats play politics in the wake of tragedy is disingenuous at best.\n\nFriday’s speakers, for instance, include Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who quickly did what he was accusing Democrats of doing – politicize the killings in his home state earlier this week – when he criticized them for calling for more gun safety measures. NRA members were also expecting to hear from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has made loosening gun laws a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, in a state that has seen a volley of recent mass shootings. But Abbott canceled his in-person appearance to instead attend a news conference in Uvalde, with his spokesperson telling the Dallas Morning News Thursday evening that the governor will address the convention “through prerecorded video.”\n\nPatrick said in a statement he was canceling his appearance, “after prayerful consideration and discussion with NRA officials.”\n\n“While a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and an NRA member, I would not want my appearance today to bring any additional pain or grief to the families and all those suffering in Uvalde,” Patrick said Friday.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. John Cornyn’s office also cited a scheduling conflict to explain why he would not attend, and several high-profile musicians have also pulled out.\n\nOther billed speakers include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024.\n\nThe NRA’s controversial leader, Wayne LaPierre, is also due to speak. LaPierre sparked outrage after a hauntingly similar shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 with a deeply political news conference. He had argued that more guns to guard schools should be the answer to mass shootings, rather than any restrictions on the assault weapons that killed multiple kids in a matter of minutes.\n\nNotably, the manufacturer of a firearm used in Tuesday’s shooting said it will not attend the convention.\n\n“Daniel Defense is not attending the NRA meeting due to the horrifying tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, where one of our products was criminally misused,” said Steve Reed, vice president of marketing for Daniel Defense, in a statement. “We believe this week is not the appropriate time to be promoting our products in Texas at the NRA meeting.”\n\nCritics demand cancellation of NRA meetings out of respect for victims\n\nGun safety advocates have criticized this year’s NRA meetings as being in deeply poor taste. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, said on CNN’s “Don Lemon Tonight” on Wednesday that political leaders should stay away.\n\n“It would be respectful for the families who are planning funerals for their children for them not to come,” he said. “You can’t say two days ago, yesterday, that you offer prayers and condolences to these families, and then three or four days later, appear at the NRA promoting the use of guns and assault weapons.”\n\nThe NRA did cancel its convention for the last two years – because of concerns over Covid-19. But in a statement this week, it said it would go ahead while praying for the victims of the Uvalde shooting and while redoubling its efforts to make schools safer. But in an ironic twist, considering the NRA’s lobbying arm argues that more guns at public events make everyone safer, the Secret Service has mandated that no firearms will be allowed in the conference hall when the former President is speaking.\n\nThe NRA may not be the force it once was after a series of financial scandals and the rise of gun safety political groups on the left. But its lobbying and campaign groups long ago succeeded in making opposition to any form of gun control tantamount in the minds of many Republican voters to the destruction of the Second Amendment. It’s a false charge, but it is hugely consequential politically and is one reason why so many GOP lawmakers are cowed at voting for any gun safety measures in Washington, even comparatively minor adjustments to background checks. And that reluctance also explains why majority support in the country for modest gun law changes almost always hits a brick wall in Washington.\n\nSmall signs of hope in Congress\n\nThe NRA-ILA leadership forum is taking place amid one of the periodic political altercations that always follow gun massacres but then fade into the background as attempts at small-scale change inevitably fail.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who will travel to Uvalde with first lady Jill Biden on Sunday, demanded to know this week, “When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” Yet like the previous Democratic President, Barack Obama, Biden has found that the existential nature of the Second Amendment to GOP politicians – plus the Senate filibuster, which some members of his own party refuse to change – means that any serious overhaul of gun laws is impossible.\n\nIn another outburst of Democratic frustration this week, Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke confronted Abbott at a news conference at which the governor was giving an update on the tragedy in Uvalde. Republicans accused O’Rourke, who’s trying to unseat Abbott in November, of politicizing the issue at a moment of grief – a reasonable charge in the circumstances.\n\nMost American gun owners behave lawfully and safely. But many Republican lawmakers cannot resist the political potency of the gun issue, which often riles up their base. And many, who still deny any correlation among the availability of high-powered weapons, lax guns laws and mass killings, are never ready to discuss safety measures. The horror just grinds on.\n\nIn Washington, Republicans attempted to portray the massacre in Texas as the isolated act of a mentally ill gunman – a random act of evil that could not have been stopped. Such arguments ignore the fact that other countries not saturated in guns have similar levels of mental illness as the United States but do not have their hearts ripped apart by regular mass shootings.\n\nWhile experience suggests that even a tentative openness to change from Republicans is a short-term tactic designed to deflect political pressure, there was at least a tiny sign of movement on Capitol Hill Thursday.\n\nEarlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell branded the Texas killings the act of a lone “maniac.” But on Thursday, the Kentucky Republican encouraged GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to work with Democrats to see if there’s any common ground for legislation in response to the Texas elementary school shooting.\n\nCornyn, whose office said earlier this week that an “unexpected change in his schedule” was keeping him from speaking at the NRA meeting, said that he wasn’t sure if the effort could forge a compromise on expanding background checks but hoped for a “new, greater sense of urgency” in the wake of the carnage that unfolded in his home state. Still, Cornyn warned that any new laws could not be used “as an excuse to infringe the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens” that he said “will do nothing to fix tragedies like this.”\n\nThis is where the tortured politics of gun control come in. The gun lobby and like-minded voters in the GOP base often insist that any measure to regulate the sale of guns or any restrictions on the kind of weapons that can be purchased represent an infringement of the constitutional right to bear arms. While the Constitution enshrines the right to bear arms, it does not specify that people have unlimited rights to use fearsome battlefield weapons the founders could never have envisaged. But the resulting pressure on Republicans from the gun lobby, which often insists that it does, almost always scuppers meaningful reform.\n\nSuch tactics, a testament to the political skill and influence of groups like the NRA over the years, has even in the past forced Trump – a leader with an almost mystical connection to Republican base voters – to back down.\n\nUnder fierce pressure following a 2018 shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Trump hosted a remarkable televised event at which he accused fellow Republicans of being “afraid” of the NRA and vowed to work with Democrats on legislative overhauls – perhaps even raising the minimum age to buy semi-automatic weapons. Such a law, had it been in place, might have stopped the 18-year-old Uvalde shooter from buying a gun.\n\nTrump, however, soon backed down when the furor over the Florida massacre faded, dimming the political incentives for him to take such a risk. The episode was just one small blip in the ex-President’s often cynical use of the gun control issue for his own political gain – a trend often evident in other areas of his time in office.\n\nNow, Trump appears to be girding for a 2024 White House bid and seems unlikely to stick his neck out after yet another gun tragedy. That’s why his pledge, in a statement on his social media platform, to offer “real leadership” at the forum on Friday seems like a long shot.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/supreme-court-miranda-rights/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court limits ability to enforce Miranda rights | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court limited the ability to enforce Miranda rights in a ruling Thursday that said that suspects who are not warned about their right to remain silent cannot sue a police officer for damages under federal civil rights law even if the evidence was ultimately used against them in their criminal trial.\n\nThe court’s ruling will cut back on an individual’s protections against self-incrimination by barring the potential to obtain damages. It also means that the failure to administer the warning will not expose a law enforcement officer to potential damages in a civil lawsuit. It will not impact, however, the exclusion of such evidence at a criminal trial.\n\nThe court clarified that while the Miranda warning protects a constitutional right, the warning itself is not a right that would trigger the ability to bring a civil lawsuit.\n\n“Today’s ruling doesn’t get rid of the Miranda right,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “But it does make it far harder to enforce. Under this ruling, the only remedy for a violation of Miranda is to suppress statements obtained from a suspect who’s not properly advised of his right to remain silent. But if the case never goes to trial, or if the government never seeks to use the statement, or if the statement is admitted notwithstanding the Miranda violation, there’s no remedy at all for the government’s misconduct.”\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, joined by the five other Republican-appointed justices, said that a violation of the Miranda right “is not itself a violation of the Fifth Amendment,” and that “we see no justification for expanding Miranda to confer a right to sue,” under the relevant statute.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, joined by the other liberal justices, said that the court’s ruling was stripping “individuals of the ability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized in Miranda.”\n\n“The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy,” she added.\n\nThe case involved Terence Tekoh, a hospital worker who was accused of sexually assaulting an immobilized female patient at a local hospital in 2014.\n\nAt issue was not whether a defendant must be read his Miranda rights, but whether he can sue an officer for damages if he doesn’t receive the Miranda warning for evidence introduced in a criminal proceeding. Lower courts have split on the issue.\n\nCarlos Vega, a Los Angeles County sheriff deputy, questioned Tekoh, although he failed to read him his rights as required by the 1966 precedent of Miranda v. Arizona, where the court held that a defendant must be warned of a “right to remain silent.” Under that precedent, without the Miranda warning, criminal trial courts are generally barred from admitting self-incriminating statements made while the defendant was in custody.\n\nTekoh ultimately confessed to the crime, was tried and acquitted – even after the introduction of his confession at trial. Later, he sued the officer under a federal law, Section 1983, that allows suits for damages against a government official for violating constitutional rights.\n\nThe parties disagreed on whether Vega used coercive techniques to extract an involuntary confession.\n\nLawyers for Vega said Tekoh’s statement was entirely consensual and voluntary, and he was not technically “in custody” at the time, while Tekoh’s lawyers contended he was bullied into confessing in a windowless room.\n\nRoman Martinez, a lawyer for Vega, said that Tekoh couldn’t bring his claim because establishing a violation of Miranda does not establish a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n“Miranda creates a procedural rule barring prosecutors from introducing—and courts from admitting—certain unwarned statements as a part of the prosecution’s case-in-chief at a criminal trial,” Martinez argued in court papers.\n\nFor Martinez, the Miranda warning is a constitutional rule, it is not a right, and under that interpretation the lawsuit cannot go forward. “Miranda does not prohibit taking unwarned statements; it merely forbids the subsequent admission of such statements at trial,” Martinez argued.\n\nHe said an appeals court ruling that went in favor of Tekoh would “saddle police departments nationwide with extraordinary burdens in connection with lawful and appropriate investigative work.” Any police interaction, according to Martinez, could give rise to a private lawsuit “even where the police officer has acted entirely lawfully.”\n\nMartinez commended the court’s ruling Thursday, saying it “confirms that Deputy Vega cannot be sued for his good-faith effort to investigate the alleged sexual assault of a defenseless hospital patient.”\n\n“As the Court explained, the landmark Miranda decision establishes an important prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination,” he added. “But the failure to give a Miranda warning does not automatically equate to a violation of the Fifth Amendment.”\n\nThe Biden administration sided with Vega.\n\n“Because the Miranda rule concerns the introduction of evidence at trial, a suspect may not sue the police officer under Section 1983 for violating that rule,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in court papers.\n\nLawyers for Tekoh argued that Vega refused to accept Tekoh’s denials and that “with a hand resting on his firearm,” Vega threatened to report Tekoh and his family members to immigration. Tekoh has a green card, and deportation could lead to persecution in Cameroon.\n\nPaul Hoffman, a lawyer for Tekoh, said that Vega was “the central actor in the chain of events leading directly to the statement being introduced at trial.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/us/wisconsin-judge-killed-targeted-attack/index.html", "title": "Former Judge John Roemer was killed in his Wisconsin home in a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA former Wisconsin judge was killed Friday in what authorities are calling a targeted attack by a suspect who also had other government officials as targets, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nFormer Juneau County Circuit Court Judge John Roemer, 68, was killed in a New Lisbon, Wisconsin, home, the Wisconsin Justice Department said in a statement.

Wade ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on June 12, 2022.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday reversed Roe v. Wade, the 50-year-old court precedent enshrining a right to abortion.\n\nDoing so now gives state lawmakers the green light to aggressively limit or ban abortion.\n\nSince a draft for Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked last month, CNN readers have asked hundreds of questions about what a reversal of the Supreme Court’s abortion rights precedents would mean and how it will affect access to the procedure. The final decision released Friday closely tracked the leaked draft.\n\nWe’re reading as many questions as we can and answering some of the most popular here.\n\nIs the Supreme Court actually overturning the law or merely saying the decision belongs with each state’s law?\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned previous court precedent that preempted state laws banning abortion before the fetus is viable, a point around 23 weeks into the pregnancy. In overturning the Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood decisions, the Supreme Court allows states to pursue bans and other restrictions on pre-viability abortion.\n\nThe ruling will not have the effect of banning abortion nationwide. According to the logic expressed in the draft decision (and with the caveat that it can still be changed before the final opinion comes out), the question of abortion policy would then go to state and local lawmakers – and potentially federal lawmakers as well.\n\nWill women get arrested for having an abortion if the Supreme Court deems it illegal?\n\nAn abortion-seeker’s criminal liability will depend on the abortion policies that her state put into place.\n\nLeaders of the anti-abortion movement have said in the past that women shouldn’t be prosecuted for obtaining abortion, and that criminal laws prohibiting it should be aimed at abortion providers or others who facilitate the procedure. Several states with abortion prohibitions that would go into effect with a Roe reversal have language exempting from prosecution the woman who obtained the abortion, but an abortion ban in Wyoming appears to muddle this question with its reference to the “pregnant woman” in the relevant code.\n\nThere’s also nothing to stop lawmakers from passing laws calling for the prosecution of the people who sought the abortion. A state legislator in Louisiana recently proposed a bill that would charge women with murder for obtaining abortion, though that bill failed to advance. Critics of the anti-abortion movement also note that, even with Roe on the books, women have been prosecuted for pregnancies that ended in miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\nWhat methods do lawmakers propose to enforce these laws? What can they legally do to find out if someone is pregnant?\n\nThe state abortion prohibitions that will go into effect with the Roe reversal don’t spell out specific enforcement tactics. The lengths local prosecutors will go to enforce abortion restrictions is very much an unanswered question. Before Roe, the aggressiveness of the enforcement of abortion bans often depended on the political environment, including the local environment that prosecutors were navigating. Now, some prosecutors in Democratic-leaning jurisdictions are vowing to not bring criminal charges under abortion restrictions that go into effect with the new Supreme Court opinion.\n\nThe information the prosecutors will seek from health care providers in order to enforce abortion bans IS very much a concern for reproductive rights advocates. HIPAA protections that typically shield an individual’s medical information from disclosure have exemptions for certain law enforcement contexts that may come into play if Roe is overturned. Likewise, there are concerns that the data that can be obtained from an abortion-seeker’s digital devices may be used to determine if she obtained an abortion. That could include information about her menstrual cycle in a period-tracking application, some fear, or search terms she uses for internet searches.\n\nBased on the legal arguments contained in the leaked draft opinion, are there any other legal precedents and SCOTUS opinions that this ruling would overturn beyond Roe v Wade? What further rights and privileges could be at risk of being scaled back if the draft becomes the law of the land?\n\nThe draft Dobbs opinion – if it became the court’s formal ruling – wouldn’t overturn other closely watched precedents in areas like same-sex marriage, contraception and interracial marriage. Those cases, like abortion, are grounded in a right to privacy that is not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, but that the court has said is implied. The Supreme Court, in handing down Roe and its successor Casey, tied the right to an abortion to the precedents in 1965’s Griswold v. Connecticut and 1967’s Loving v. Virginia, which struck down state restrictions on contraceptives and interracial marriage, respectively. The 2003 Lawrence v. Texas ruling invalidating Texas’ anti-sodomy law and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide relied on Loving and Griswold as well.\n\nIn the Dobbs draft that leaked, Alito went out of his way in his draft to describe Roe as distinct from those other rulings grounded in a right to privacy because, he wrote, “Abortion destroys…potential life.”\n\n“None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite,” Alito wrote. “They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.”\n\nStill, skeptics see the Roe reversal as opening the door to challenges to those other precedents, with Obergefell being the most vulnerable. Alito himself wrote a dissent to the 2015 ruling that argued that “The Constitution says nothing about a right to same-sex marriage, but the Court holds that the term ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses this right.”\n\nConservative lawmakers and legal advocates have also argued the court’s Obergefell precedent makes the same errors the court made in enshrining abortion rights.\n\nThe Mississippi law at issue bans abortion starting from 15 weeks after the last menstrual period. If the Supreme Court allows this law to stand, will it then be legal to ban abortion at earlier points in pregnancy? Will it be possible for states to ban medication-induced first-trimester abortions, which are the most common type? Many states seem poised to do so.\n\nIf the draft opinion that was leaked was adopted, not only would the Mississippi 15-week ban be upheld, but states – and potentially the federal government – would be allowed to ban abortion earlier in the pregnancy, including medication-induced first trimester abortions. More than a dozen states have so-called “trigger laws,” under which bans on abortion would be implemented if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and several more have other types of bans that could go into effect with the reversal of previous Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut until the court issues its final opinion, we won’t know for sure how aggressively states will be allowed to restrict abortion under the court’s new precedent.\n\nIn the event of rape or incest or even underage pregnancy of say 14 years old, where does the law lie for these individuals if Roe vs Wade is overturned?\n\nIf Roe is overturned, exemptions in abortion bans for rape, incest or health of the mother will vary state by state. In the wave of abortion limits that have been passed by state legislatures recently in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling, only a few of the proposals included exemptions for rape and incest.\n\nIt’s a question lawmakers will likely revisit once the Supreme Court’s ruling, assuming it overturns Roe, is handed down. While previewing plans to call a special legislative session once the opinion is issued, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he opposed rape or incest exemptions. The six-week ban he signed into law last year – which is currently blocked by court order – included those exemptions.\n\nOn the flip side, Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN this May that he supported adding rape and incest exemptions in the trigger law currently on the books in the state.\n\nHow are in vitro fertilizations defined? If a state defines the fertilized egg as a human with rights, then if a doctor fertilizes four eggs, but does [not] implant all four in a woman, is that homicide?\n\nWhat a Roe reversal would mean for fertility treatments is a major uncertainty.\n\nPhysicians and legal experts in the field are currently grappling with state abortion policies frame their laws around the moment of fertilization, when the egg has united with the sperm. Some of those state laws have language that would appear to exempt the disposal of unused embryos created for IVF, but that language doesn’t necessarily exempt the process of selective reduction, when a woman whose fertility treatments lead to a multiple pregnancy has one or more of those fetuses terminated to protect the viability of the other fetuses and/or the health of the mother. More broadly, fertility law experts raise concerns about how a Roe reversal will embolden lawmakers to regulate IVF procedures – which have been largely shielded from the abortion debate because of the protections of Roe.\n\nIf the current heavily conservative Supreme Court can overturn Roe v. Wade, that’s been on the books for decades, what’s to stop a future heavily liberal court from overturning this current anti-Roe v. Wade decision in say, 20 years from now?\n\nTechnically, there’s nothing to stop a Supreme Court from revisiting abortion precedent and a court with a more liberal makeup may very well do so. However, one reason that a future liberal Supreme Court majority might be disinclined to change a major precedent again is if those justices feel more loyalty to the principle of stare decisis – the legal principle that discourages overturning precedent unless certain conditions are met – than the loyalty that has been shown by the conservative majority poised to reverse Roe.\n\nThis respect for precedence, for instance, is why Chief Justice John Roberts voted in 2020 to strike down a Louisiana abortion clinic regulation, after he dissented in a 2016 case where the majority struck down a similar Texas law.\n\nCan the right to an abortion be codified by a national vote?\n\nNot directly. A constitutional amendment could be enacted to extend that right. But the process of amending US Constitution begins with a proposal that has the support of either two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, or with a convention called for by two-thirds of the states. Ratification of an amendment requires the support of three-fourths of state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions in each state.\n\nWhy does the currently Democrat-controlled legislature not pass a federal law making abortion legal? This would make the SCOTUS decision a non issue.\n\nDemocrats currently lack the votes to dismantle the Senate filibuster, a 60-vote procedural mechanism that Republicans can use to block federal abortion rights legislation – so as long as 40 senators oppose abortion rights. But it’s worth noting that the Women’s Health Protection Act – a bill would codify and expand upon Roe – failed 49-51 when it was voted on in May in the Senate, meaning that, even without the filibuster, it would have not become law.\n\nThere are also legal questions about whether it would be constitutional for federal lawmakers to enact a nationwide ban. The late Justice Antonin Scalia stressed in his legal writings about abortion that the policy-decisions belonged in the hands of individual states, while expressing skepticism that Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the procedure. Friday, Alito used notably open-ended language that doesn’t limit the provenance of abortion legislation to state lawmakers.\n\nCan anti-abortion states prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion in another state? It worries me that states could enact further laws restricting women the choice to leave the state to have an abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion state lawmakers have already expressed interest in regulating conduct around abortion that happens outside of their borders. Perhaps the most aggressive example is a failed bill in Missouri that would have extended its abortion laws to out-of-state abortions if the mother is a Missouri resident or if “Sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.” That proposal hasn’t advanced, but there are other examples of this tactic that might move forward in the future. A handful of Texas lawmakers, for instance, are calling for penalties for companies that cover the costs for employees who travel out of state to obtain abortions.\n\nThe legal authority that state lawmakers have to reach beyond state lines is very much an open question and the topic of a coming law review article that provides more information about the relevant precedents.\n\nIs it possible that women and men who are pro-choice could send abortion pills to women in other states with draconian anti-abortion laws?\n\nWith medication abortion – a two pill regimen that terminates a pregnancy – becoming the method used in a majority of abortions performed nationwide, red states have already been cracking down on the mailing of abortion pills and on administering the pills without an in-person visit with a physician. These state laws started gaining steam after the FDA allowed for the mailing of abortion pills in a pandemic-related move that has now been made permanent. If Roe is overturned, medication abortion will be covered by abortion bans and we might see other types of proposals to limit medication abortion.\n\nBut how to enforce these restrictions on mailing abortion pills is another question anti-abortion lawmakers are still working through. Texas last year updated its previously existing ban on mailing abortion pills to make it the type of crime that would warrant extradition. Blue states have countered with measures that would prohibit their state authorities from cooperating with such extradition requests.\n\nThere are also international sources from which women in anti-abortion states may seek delivery of medication abortion.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/breonna-taylor-federal-charges/index.html", "title": "Breonna Taylor's death: Four current, former Louisville police ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFour current and former Louisville police officers involved in the deadly raid on Breonna Taylor’s home – including detectives who worked on the search warrant and the ex-officer accused of firing blindly into her home – have been charged with civil rights violations and other counts, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday.\n\nThe charges mark the first federal counts leveled against any of the officers involved in the botched raid. In addition to civil rights offenses, federal authorities charged the four with unlawful conspiracies, unconstitutional use of force and obstruction, Garland said.\n\nTaylor’s mom, Tamika Palmer, said she’s waited 874 days for federal charges to be filed and has beaten “everything sent to break” her. Her daughter’s death has taken her to a “place that we can’t even imagine,” she said.\n\n“Every day’s been March 13 for me,” Palmer said, referring to the day Taylor was killed in 2020.\n\nFormer Detective Joshua Jaynes, 40, Detective Kelly Goodlett and Sgt. Kyle Meany, 35, were charged with submitting a false affidavit to search Taylor’s home ahead of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department’s raid, and then working together to create a “false cover story in an attempt to escape responsibility for their roles in preparing the warrant affidavit that contained false information,” according to court documents.\n\nEx-detective Brett Hankison is alleged to have “willfully used unconstitutionally excessive force … when he fired his service weapon into Taylor’s apartment through a covered window and covered glass door.” He is charged with depriving Taylor and a guest in her home “of their constitutional rights by firing shots through a bedroom window that was covered with blinds and a blackout curtain,” the US Department of Justice said.\n\nThe 46-year-old also faces charges of depriving three of Taylor’s neighbors of their constitutional rights as, according to the indictment, the bullets he fired traveled through a wall in Taylor’s home and into an adjacent apartment.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Everything you need to know about the Breonna Taylor case 03:34 - Source: CNN\n\nJaynes and Meany stand accused of willfully depriving Taylor of her constitutional rights by drafting and approving a false affidavit to obtain a search warrant, while knowing “the affidavit contained false and misleading statements, omitted material facts, relied on stale information, and was not supported by probable cause,” the DOJ statement said. Both men “knew that the execution of the search warrant would be carried out by armed LMPD officers, and could create a dangerous situation both for those officers and for anyone who happened to be in Taylor’s home,” it said.\n\nGoodlett conspired with Jaynes and Meany to “falsify the search warrant for Taylor’s home and to cover up their actions afterward,” the statement said.\n\nJaynes and another detective tried to cover up their actions by drafting a bogus investigative letter and making false statements to investigators, according to the statement. Jaynes falsified a report in hopes of impeding a criminal probe into Taylor’s death; Meany also made false statements, the statement said.\n\nGoodlett and Jaynes met in a garage weeks after the botched raid and conspired to relay false information to investigators, the attorney general alleged.\n\n“We allege that Ms. Taylor’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated when defendants Joshua Jaynes, Kyle Meany and Kelly Goodlett sought a warrant to search Ms. Taylor’s home knowing the officers lacked probable cause for the search,” Garland said.\n\nThe affidavit falsely claimed officers had verified that the target of their drug trafficking investigation had received packages at Taylor’s address, but Jaynes and Goodlett knew that was not true, Garland said.\n\nJaynes, appearing virtually from a detention facility wearing shorts and a polo shirt, entered a not guilty plea. Prosecutors are not requesting that he be detained pending trial, but they ask that he be prohibited from contacting any possible witnesses or defendants in the case.\n\nHankison, who fired 10 shots into Taylor’s home and was acquitted on state wanton endangerment charges earlier this year, was indicted on two federal counts of deprivation of rights under color of law. Hankison’s attorney declined to comment. Only Hankison was charged at the state level.\n\nOfficers who carried out the search warrant were not involved in the drafting of the warrant and were unaware it contained false information, the attorney general said.\n\n“We share but we cannot fully imagine the grief felt by Breonna Taylor’s loved ones and all of those affected by the events of March 13, 2020,” Garland said. “Breonna Taylor should be alive today.”\n\nA conviction on the charge of willfully violating someone’s rights carries a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison when the violation leads to death, according to the DOJ. A conviction on an obstruction count commands a maximum penalty of 20 years, and the conspiracy and false statement charges each carry maximum sentences of five years, the department says.\n\nAttorney: ‘Huge step toward justice’\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Taylor’s family, applauded the charges, as well the “tough fight” waged by Taylor’s family, attorneys, advocates and community members. In 2020, Crump and his team secured a settlement that paid Taylor’s family $12 million and led to sweeping police reforms, including the use of social workers to provide support on certain police runs and the requirement that commanders review and approve search warrants before seeking judicial approval.\n\n“Today was a huge step toward justice. We are grateful for the diligence and dedication of the FBI and the DOJ as they investigated what led to Breonna’s murder and what transpired afterwards. The justice that Breonna received today would not have been possible without the efforts of Attorney General Merrick Garland or Assistant AG for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke,” Crump said in a statement. “We hope this announcement of a guilty plea sends a message to all other involved officers that it is time to stop covering up and time to accept responsibility for their roles in causing the death of an innocent, beautiful young Black woman.”\n\nClarke said in a statement, “Since the founding of our nation, the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution has guaranteed that all people have a right to be secure in their homes, free from false warrants, unreasonable searches and the use of unjustifiable and excessive force by the police. These indictments reflect the Justice Department’s commitment to preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system and to protecting the constitutional rights of every American.”\n\nIn January 2021, the LMPD terminated Jaynes and his colleague Myles Cosgrove. Cosgrove was fired for his use of deadly force in unleashing 16 rounds into Taylor’s home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter.\n\nJaynes was fired for “failing to complete a Search Warrant Operations Plan form” and being untruthful about verifying that Taylor’s previous boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, had been receiving packages at Taylor’s home, the termination letter said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'You have to grieve and fight at the same time': Ben Crump 14:28 - Source: CNN\n\nFollowing his termination, Jaynes’ attorney, Thomas Clay, said the move was not unexpected and promised to fight to have his client reinstated.\n\n“It’s our position that he did nothing wrong in any of the activities relating to this search,” Clay told CNN in January 2021.\n\nCosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said, adding that the shooting was justified because Taylor’s boyfriend fired at officers first. Kenneth Walker II, Taylor’s boyfriend, has repeatedly said he thought the officers were intruders and fired one shot when they broke down the door.\n\nCrump co-counsel Lonita Baker took aim at Cameron following Garland’s announcement Thursday, saying the attorney general “has no right holding any political offices” representing Kentucky.\n\n“The federal government had the guts to do what Daniel Cameron did not,” she said.\n\nA review board upheld Cosgrove’s termination last year, and Jaynes lost a similar appeal before the board in June, according to CNN affiliate WDRB.\n\nThe Louisville police union said at the time the firings were “unjustified.”\n\n“There is certainly no evidence in this case that policies and procedures of the LMPD were violated to the extent that warranted termination,” the River City Fraternal Order of Police said in a statement. “Interim Chief (Yvette) Gentry not only made the wrong decision, but also sent an ominous message to every sworn officer of the Louisville Metro Police Department.”\n\nTaylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot and killed in her apartment during a flawed forced-entry raid in the early hours of March 13, 2020. Her death, along with that of other Black people at the hands of law enforcement – including George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia – sparked a summer of protests calling for police reform.\n\nNo officer who took part in the raid has previously been charged for Taylor’s actual killing.\n\nState prosecutors charged only Hankison in connection with the shooting. The LMPD fired Hankison in June 2020, and in September 2020, a grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of felony wanton endangerment for blindly firing 10 shots into Taylor’s home.\n\nA jury acquitted Hankison on all charges in March.", "authors": ["Eliott C.

But a pair of statements from Trump criticizing Pence’s actions on January 6, 2021, were the final straw, said two people close to the former vice president. He had to say something.\n\nIn the hours after his stunning rebuke of his onetime running mate, Pence fielded calls from donors, Republican lawmakers and top conservative leaders eager to privately applaud him. His speech to a gathering of conservative legal minds had caught their attention after he declared – in no uncertain terms – that “Trump is wrong” in his insistence that Pence could have unilaterally overturned the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBuried deep in his remarks at a Federalist Society conference near Orlando, Pence defended his actions last January, including his refusal to reject the Electoral College votes in states Trump had lost. Trump’s repeated suggestions that his vice president could have rejected those ballots was “un-American,” Pence said.\n\n“He is not looking for this to be a main storyline, but if something is falsely said about him, he is going to correct it,” said a person close to Pence.\n\nThose familiar with Pence’s thinking say the outpouring of support that he’s seen since taking on Trump by name – both in gushing op-eds by conservative media outlets and in private conversations with GOP donors and fellow Republicans – has emboldened him as he looks to chart a future in politics that could include a White House bid against his former boss in 2024. At the same time, it also underscores the degree to which many Republicans are still unwilling to bat down Trump’s lies about the 2020 election in public – instead choosing to privately praise those who do so – even when there could be an upside to telling the truth. Although the GOP remains Trump’s party, those around Pence see his distinctions from Trump as an asset.\n\nOne Pence ally said donor engagement in the former vice president’s advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, “has picked up in [the] days since” Pence addressed the Federalist Society crowd in Florida.\n\nAnother person close to Pence said he and his team were pleased that his remarks didn’t elicit the scorched-earth reaction that Trump typically reserves for Republicans who deny his claims about the last presidential contest. This person said it “would have been reasonable to expect campaign-style Trump” to include a derogatory nickname for Pence somewhere in his response, and that his muted reaction came as a surprise. Instead, Trump attacked Pence’s “unwitting advisers” and merely accused his former vice president of “being an automatic conveyor belt” for then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to certify Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nThe harshest critiques of Pence’s comments came from Trump allies, rather than the former President himself. During a Tuesday appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast, for instance, former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro blasted Pence as “never a pure Trump guy” and “the prisoner of Marc Short,” a longtime Pence confidant and the former vice president’s chief of staff.\n\n“Mike, you are dead politically,” said Navarro, who has been a vocal champion of Trump’s election lies.\n\nPence felt ‘compelled’ to respond\n\nMonths after they last spoke, Trump issued a statement on January 30 calling out Pence by name for declining to “change the outcome” of the 2020 election. Citing ongoing bipartisan negotiations about reforming the century-old Electoral Count Act, which spells out the process by which Congress currently certifies Electoral College votes submitted by each state, Trump falsely claimed that such legislative discussions validated his belief that the ECA does “allow the Vice President to change the results of the election.”\n\nTwo days later, Trump went after Pence again.\n\nThis time, the former President attacked the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot and claimed that Pence could have rejected the counting and “sent the votes back” to the states. Trump also suggested the committee investigate “why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval.” (The House panel has interviewed two top Pence aides who witnessed the pressure campaign mounted against the former vice president by Trump and his allies in the days leading up to January 6.)\n\n“[H]e could have overturned the Election!” Trump said in a second statement.\n\nTwo people said Pence was prompted to criticize Trump explicitly after the former President issued the pair of statements wrongly describing Pence’s powers as vice president. One of the people close to Pence said he was “compelled” to correct the record after declining to engage in such a direct rebuttal of Trump in his previous mentions of January 6.\n\nPence’s team determined that the Federalist Society event would be a prime opportunity for him to refute Trump’s claims because of the audience – not hardcore MAGA fans but constitutional scholars and conservative lawyers. During a separate appearance in Florida last June, a crowd at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition conference greeted Pence with boos and cries of “traitor” as he began his remarks.\n\n“If there is any audience that is going to understand the details of the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, it would be the Federalist Society,” said a former Pence aide.\n\nThe former vice president’s latest response to Trump reveals how carefully he is navigating the worlds of conservative and Republican politics as he weighs a run for president and looks to be a top surrogate for GOP candidates in the 2022 midterms. Pence has been calculating in how he creates a separate political identity from Trump. In public appearances, he has continued to tout the achievements of the “Trump-Pence administration” and contrast them with the perceived failures of Biden’s presidency.\n\nHe has also leaned into his identity as a religious conservative as he works to remind party officials and GOP donors who he was before he joined Trump’s ticket and how he can be their ally on a handful of social conservative causes. In November, Pence delivered a speech hosted by the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List in which he urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and in April, he will deliver the keynote address at a fundraiser for the Carolina Pregnancy Center in the all important early-voting state of South Carolina, according to a person involved with the planning.\n\nStill, Pence’s divide with Trump over January 6 has perhaps been his most distinguishing factor as he prepares for a possible presidential run in 2024. Other potential Republican candidates, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have dodged the question of the validity of the 2020 election and Pence’s powers to change the outcome.\n\nBuilding their case\n\nPence’s forward-looking approach and emphasis on party unity, his supporters hope, will in time look better to Republican voters than Trump’s vindictiveness and refusal to rise to the moment. Pence’s advisers want to build a case that he was and remains a source of steady conservative leadership where Trump, implicitly, has not been.\n\nTo this end, Pence’s team was pleased with the reception his Friday remarks received in some conservative media outlets.\n\n“Good for Mike Pence,” declared the headline of a column by National Review online editor Philip Klein, in which he praised Pence for upbraiding Trump “forcefully and by name.” A separate editorial by the conservative outlet encouraged the Republican National Committee, which formally censured GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger last week for their participation in the House probe of January 6 through a resolution that described the events surrounding the riots at the US Capitol as “legitimate political discourse,” to learn “from the example of Mike Pence.”\n\n“There is … no conceivable political benefit to the Republican Party or its members – other than Donald Trump – in looking to defend or minimize January 6 rather than simply move on,” read the editorial.\n\nAnd The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial board wrote in its Sunday editorial that “Americans should welcome Mike Pence’s stand Friday for constitutional principle on elections no matter its political cost.”\n\nDespite the positive reaction he received in certain corners of the GOP, one of the people close to Pence described his comments as “out of character” and said they did not expect him to include such reactionary lines in future speeches unless Trump continues to attack his former vice president.\n\n“Generally speaking, he would rather be talking about the case he’s trying to make about looking ahead. But future events may dictate similar reactions,” said another person close to Pence.\n\nFor now, Pence has gravitated toward policy-focused speeches, such as his July speech on China at The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank where Pence is a “distinguished visiting fellow,” and opportunities for him to connect with younger or more religious GOP voters and may not be as enthralled with Trump as others in the party. The former vice president has been hosting a podcast for the Young America’s Foundation, a decades-old group that aims to introduce students to conservative ideas, and he is due to appear at Stanford University for an event hosted by the campus’s College Republicans later this month.\n\nPence is also careful to direct his more overt criticism in public appearances toward the Biden administration. In an interview last week on “Fox & Friends,” he went after Biden’s announcement that employees at medium-size and large businesses would be required to get vaccinated for the coronavirus.\n\nAnd despite the attention his rebuke of Trump received, Pence spent the bulk of his Federalist Society remarks going after the Biden administration and the excesses of the “radical left.”\n\n“In less than a year, the Biden-Harris administration has unleashed a tidal wave of left-wing policies that threaten to wipe out the progress we have made,” Pence said in Florida before providing a litany of criticisms of Biden’s policies and approach to governance. This portion of the remarks resembled a campaign stump speech, as did the climax of his remarks.\n\n“I promise you, we will stay in the fight,” Pence said.", "authors": ["Gaborr Michael Warren", "Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}]}

Between August and October alone, the number of people aged between 50 and 64 who classed themselves as retired fell by 84,000.\n\nThe Telegraph suggested that “soaring living costs – as inflation runs at a 41-year-high – are likely a key reason for the return to work”.\n\n‘Older people bearing the brunt’\n\nIn the UK, roughly half a million more over-50s became “economically inactive” after Covid hit, according to the ONS.\n\nThe recent drop in inactivity among the age group is “small” but “could be the start of a large-scale ‘unretirement’”, said The Telegraph. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said the reversal “tallies with other data which suggest more people in their 50s are thinking of going back to work”.\n\nThe Great Unretirement has been linked to “spiralling inflation, volatile financial markets and the soaring cost of living”, said The Guardian.\n\n“People who thought they could retire comfortably during the pandemic are having to unretire and find work again to bring in extra income and top up their pensions while they still can,” said Stuart Lewis, the chief executive of Rest Less, a digital community for the over-50s.\n\nOlder people, and particularly pensioners, “are expected to bear the heaviest brunt of the soaring cost of living”, This Is Money reported. The state pension, currently £9,627 a year, will be “swallowed up by rising energy bills” this winter unless the government offers additional help.\n\n“It is little wonder then that so many feel they must carry on working into old age,” the site added.\n\n‘A sense of purpose’\n\nThe UK is an outlier in unretirement terms. A study by the Learning and Work Institute found that the UK has seen a slower post-Covid return to economic activity among people aged 55-64 than other countries including Germany, Italy, the US, Japan and Australia.\n\n“That may well be down to the state of the workplace in Britain,” said Paul Waugh on the i news site.\n\nAn international survey of 4,500 over-50s by Business Leader found that “people in the UK were less satisfied with the number of hours they worked (26%), their work-life balance (25%), their commute (25%) and their levels of pay (20%) than their American and German counterparts”.\n\nThis reported dissatisfaction may also explain why so many workers of all ages have been “quiet quitting” this year, Waugh added.\n\nThe economic inactivity hike during the pandemic came about not because people were “too sick to work but because they are sick of working”, agreed Camilla Cavendish in the Financial Times. Yet while retiring early may seem desirable in the short term, “what is clear from multiple studies is that health and happiness in later life is strongly correlated with a sense of purpose”, she continued.\n\nSome of the people coming out of retirement may have realised that work is “a great way to maintain a sense of purpose in later life and to support mental health”. But if many others conclude that “work is optional, or even hostile, we are in serious trouble”.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958835/quiz-of-the-week-3-9-december", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 3 - 9 December | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

There’s no precedent for that – but there’s also no precedent for more than 50 government officials to resign in two days in order to force a Prime Minister out.\n\nWill Johnson’s resignation trigger a general election?\n\nNo. It starts the Conservative Party process for choosing a new leader of the party.\n\nUK Prime Ministers are not directly elected by the people; Johnson is Prime Minister because he is the head of the largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Conservatives will still be the largest party after Johnson quits, so the new head of the party will become Prime Minister.\n\nHow is the new Conservative Party leader chosen?\n\nLeadership candidates need the support of at least eight lawmakers.\n\nIf there are more than two candidates, Conservative Party lawmakers hold round after round of votes to whittle the number of leadership candidates down to two.\n\nThen Conservative Party members nationwide vote – by mail – between the two finalists.\n\nThe winner becomes leader of the party – and Prime Minister.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nIs there any way to force Johnson to leave before a new Conservative Party leader is chosen?\n\nConservative lawmakers could, in theory, try to force him out themselves by calling a vote of confidence among Tory MPs. But Johnson survived a vote like that just a month ago.\n\nUnder current party rules, that means there can’t be another party confidence vote in him for 12 months.\n\nThe rules could be changed, but it’s not clear the Conservative Party wants to start that kind of infighting when Johnson has already said he’s going, and when a leadership contest is under way.\n\nCan’t the opposition do anything to force Johnson out?\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said Thursday that if the Conservatives didn’t push Johnson out immediately, the opposition would call a confidence vote in the government among the entire House of Commons.\n\nIf the opposition won, it could theoretically lead to a general election – but even with all the chaos in the Conservative Party at the moment, they still have a big majority in the House of Commons, and they’re not likely to want a general election at the same time as a leadership election. So the chances of the opposition bringing the government down now are slim.\n\nWhen Johnson does finally leave Downing Street, what happens?\n\nHe submits his resignation to the Queen, in person.\n\nThe Palace will announce officially that Queen Elizabeth II has accepted Johnson’s resignation, and will say who she has invited to become Prime Minister to replace him. That person will then go to meet the Queen to accept the invitation. This is a formality.\n\nDoes the new Prime Minister have to call a general election?\n\nNo. The United Kingdom isn’t scheduled to have another general election until December 2024.\n\nThe new Prime Minister could choose to ask Parliament to vote for an early election, but isn’t required to do so.", "authors": ["Richard Allen Greene"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-resignation-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson: UK Prime Minister resigns after mutiny in his party ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBoris Johnson’s turbulent tenure as Britain’s Prime Minister came to an end Thursday after a historic party revolt over a series of ethics scandals forced him to step down.\n\nIt took the resignation of nearly 60 members of his government – almost half the payroll – for Johnson to finally abandon his attempts to cling on to power. Even then, the Prime Minister insisted that he would continue as caretaker leader while the Conservative Party launches the process of choosing a successor.\n\nSome senior figures in his party say even that will be unsustainable, given the dwindling number of people willing to work for him.\n\nOthers are already lining up to replace him. Party officials say they will announce the timetable for a leadership election by Monday.\n\nSpeaking in front of the famous 10 Downing Street door, the same place where many of his predecessors delivered their own resignation address, Johnson announced that he would be stepping down – without actually saying the words out loud.\n\n“It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore, a new prime minister,” Johnson said.\n\n“The process of choosing that new leader should begin now,” he added, saying the time line will be announced next week.\n\nIn a sign that he is planning to stay in the office for as long as he can, Johnson announced he had appointed a new cabinet “to serve, as I will, until a new leader is in place.” Appointing new cabinet ministers means that the government can continue to function as he prepares to depart.\n\nJohnson spoke of his attempts to stay on as leader and how “painful” it is for him to step down, but made no mention of the scandals that have proved his political downfall.\n\n“In the last few days, I’ve tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we’re delivering so much… and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally,” Johnson said.\n\n“I regret not to have been successful in those arguments, and of course, it’s painful, not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,” he said, adding that he’s proud of “getting Brexit done” and “leading the West in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nJohnson went on to address voters directly, expressing sadness at stepping down after nearly three years.\n\n“To you, the British public: I know that there will be many people who are relieved and, perhaps, quite a few will also be disappointed,” he said. “And I want you to know how sad I am to be giving up the best job in the world, but them’s the breaks.”\n\nJohnson has in recent months been engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. The latest was Downing Street’s botched handling of the resignation by Johnson’s former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week.\n\nJohnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis – despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister’s Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn’t going to resign.\n\nHe finally gave in Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Johnson had made the “right decision” to resign. “We need calmness and unity now and to keep governing while a new leader is found,” she added.\n\nGreg Clark, newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said that he had a “duty to ensure that the country has a functioning government.”\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, said it was “good news for the country” that Johnson had decided to resign, adding that “it should have happened long ago.”\n\n“He was always unfit for office. He has been responsible for lies, scandal and fraud on an industrial scale,” said Starmer on Twitter.\n\nThe opposition leader also had scathing words for the Conservatives. “They have been in power for 12 years. The damage they have done is profound. Twelve years of economic stagnation. Twelve years of declining public services. Twelve years of empty promises,” Starmer said.\n\n“Enough is enough. We don’t need to change the Tory at the top – we need a proper change of government. We need a fresh start for Britain.”\n\n‘Needless damage’\n\nConventionally, when a Conservative leader resigns, he or she gives the party time to hold a thorough leadership contest, in which Conservative lawmakers and then party members nationwide vote.\n\nBut some said Johnson should leave office more quickly.\n\n“We now need a new Leader as soon as practicable,” Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter. “Someone who can rebuild trust, heal the country, and set out a new, sensible and consistent economic approach to help families,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for the leadership question to be settled.\n\n“There will be a widespread sense of relief that the chaos of the last few days (indeed months) will come to an end, though notion of Boris Johnson staying on as PM until autumn seems far from ideal, and surely not sustainable?” Sturgeon said in a series of tweets.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker told CNN that the party needs “to move swiftly to a leadership contest.”\n\nBaker said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab should be caretaker prime minister, but that Johnson could also continue in office. Raab has deputized for Johnson in the past: When the PM was in intensive care with Covid-19 in April 2020 and then again briefly last month when Johnson underwent “routine” operation and was put under general anesthetic.\n\nRaab said he would not stand as next Conservative party leader, according to Britain’s PA news agency, which would make him a candidate for a caretaker PM if Johnson was to step down early.\n\n“I am absolutely determined that we should not prolong this crisis. If it’s agreed within government that Boris Johnson should continue as caretaker, then that’s fine with me,” Baker told CNN. “Because we need to just end the crisis, get into a leadership contest, and start fresh in September.”\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major said it would be “unwise and may be unsustainable” for Johnson to remain in the office of prime minister for long while a new Conservative leader is chosen. He too suggested Raab could serve as the acting prime minister.\n\nHours after Johnson’s announcement, Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat launched his campaign for the top job with an editorial in UK newspaper the Telegraph.\n\nBarrage of criticism\n\nJohnson’s departure will mark a remarkable downfall for a prime minister who was once seen as having political superpowers, with an appeal that transcended traditional party lines.\n\nHe won a landslide victory in December 2019 on the promise of delivering a Brexit deal and leading the UK to a bright future outside the European Union. But his premiership unraveled in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn recent months the prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of some members of his government, including illegal, Covid-19 lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nNumerous other scandals have also hit his standing in the polls. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and ordering MPs to vote in such a way that would protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote among members of his own party, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nHe suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nHis reputation was also damaged by the resignation of his second ethics adviser in less than two years.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Luke Mcgee Ivana Kottasová", "Jack Guy", "Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/uk/rishi-sunak-sajid-javid-resignation-boris-johnson-intl/index.html", "title": "Huge blow for Boris Johnson as senior UK government ministers ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt a huge and sudden blow on Tuesday when two of his top ministers announced their resignations, saying they could no longer work for a government mired in scandal.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced their decisions to quit within minutes of each other on Tuesday evening, plunging Johnson’s troubled administration into renewed chaos and prompting a wave of other junior ministers and officials to resign.\n\nSome called on Johnson himself to step down, and there was speculation that if he refused to go, members of his own party would launch a formal effort to unseat him – less than a month after the last one failed.\n\nThe immediate cause of the resignations was the bungled handling of a recent controversy, but came against the backdrop of months of turmoil in which Johnson was fined by police for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules.\n\n“The public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously,” Sunak said in his resignation letter, posted to Twitter. “I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.”\n\n“I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this,” Sunak added.\n\nJavid wrote that “it has been an enormous privilege to serve in this role, but I regret that I can no longer continue in good conscience.” Javid added that the vote of confidence in the prime minister last month “was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.”\n\n“I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too,” Javid wrote.\n\nOther ministers and officials occupying more junior posts in the government quit in the hours that followed, with more resignations continuing on Wednesday morning. Johnson moved to shore up his position, replacing his two Cabinet ministers late on Tuesday.\n\nScandal after scandal\n\nThe latest crisis blew up out of Downing Street’s handling of last week’s resignation of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, who stepped down from his post last Thursday amid allegations he had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before.\n\nWhile he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nDowning Street had struggled to explain why Pincher was in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations about his previous alleged conduct, denying Johnson knew anything specific about the allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that a complaint had been made against Pincher in the Foreign Office about three years ago and that Johnson was briefed on what happened.\n\nMinutes before Sunak and Javid announced their resignations, Johnson acknowledged it “was a mistake” to appoint Pincher to his government.\n\n“I got this complaint. It was something that was only raised with me very cursory, but I wish that we had acted on it and that he had not continued in government because he then went on, I’m afraid, to behave, as far as we can see – according to the allegations that we have – very, very badly,” Johnson said in a broadcast interview.\n\nUK opposition leader Keir Starmer said it was “clear” that the government was “collapsing.”\n\n“Tory cabinet ministers have known all along who this Prime Minister is. They have been his cheerleaders throughout this sorry saga. Backing him when he broke the law. Backing him when he lied repeatedly. Backing him when he mocked the sacrifices of the British people,” the Labour Party leader said in a statement released after the two resignations.\n\nFor months Johnson has been facing a barrage of criticism over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson has faced numerous other scandals that have hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide victory just two-and-a-half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping MPs to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nBut while he managed to win the confidence vote, he suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nAccording to an Ipsos UK survey conducted between 22 and 29 June, Johnson’s Conservative Party, by some measures, is at its lowest level recorded in more than a decade. Just 21% of respondents said it is “fit to govern” – the lowest number for either the Conservatives or Labour since Ipsos started tracking this metric in 2011.\n\nThe chaos in Westminster had ripple effects in the financial markets, pushing the value of the British pound against the dollar to its lowest in more than two years.\n\nMore resignations\n\nDowning Street did not hesitate filling the vacant roles. Nadhim Zahawi, who was previously Secretary of State for Education, was appointed as Chancellor, while Downing Street Chief of Staff Steve Barclay became the new Health Secretary. Michelle Donelan replaced Zahawi as Education Secretary.\n\nThe resignation of the two Cabinet ministers prompted more junior figures to follow. Conservative party vice chair Bim Afolami announced his decision to quit live on television. During an interview with Tom Newton Dunn on Talk TV, Afolami said: “I just don’t think the Prime Minister any longer has my support… the support of the party or indeed the country anymore.”\n\nAlex Chalk, who served as the Solicitor General for Englnad and Wales, one of the government’s most senior law officers, also quit, saying in his resignation letter that it was time “for fresh leadership.”\n\n“To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible,” Chalk said.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Morocco, Andrew Murrison, also stepped down, blasting the “rolling chaos of the last six months” and saying that Boris Johnson’s “position has become unrecoverable.”\n\nAt least half a dozen other junior-ranking government officials also announced resignations later on Tuesday, and more quit on Wednesday morning.\n\nAllies of the Prime Minister insisted he would fight on. But, adding to the sense of chaos, two more ministers resigned just as Zahawi was giving an interview to BBC Radio 4’s Today program, regarded as the most high-profile of morning broadcast shows. As Zahawi responded to being told of the first resignation, the presenter, Nick Robinson, interrupted him to tell him of another.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/what-happens-next-truss-uk-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "What happens next after Liz Truss resigns as British prime minister?", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe resignation of Liz Truss on Thursday after a disastrous six-week premiership has set the ball rolling on the race to be the next Conservative Party leader.\n\nA new leader, who as head of the largest party in the House of Commons becomes Britain’s prime minister, is expected to be announced on Friday October 28, according to the Conservative Party official responsible for the process.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party, which opinion polls put on course for a landslide victory, immediately demanded an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” its leader Keir Starmer said after Truss resigned. “We need a general election, now.”\n\nGraham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee, is expected to announce how the next leader will be chosen.

The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has suffered the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010.

Sunak had attempted to become leader during the summer following the resignation of Johnson, but lost to Liz Truss who stepped down on Thursday.\n\nA runoff between the two men could have proved divisive for the ruling Conservative party, not least because many of Johnson’s supporters blame Sunak’s resignation in July for sparking the downfall of his government.

In a tweet, he wrote, “The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis. That’s why I am standing to be Leader of the Conservative Party and your next Prime Minister. I want to fix our economy, unite our Party and deliver for our country.”\n\nAfter Johnson’s Sunday announcement that he would not seek the become the next Conservative Party leader, Sunak tweeted, “Boris Johnson delivered Brexit and the great vaccine roll-out. He led our country through some of the toughest challenges we have ever faced, and then took on Putin and his barbaric war in Ukraine. We will always be grateful to him for that.”\n\nSunak will be up against Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who said Sunday she regretted the so-called “mini budget” that led to economic turmoil in Britain and the resignation of Truss.\n\n“I very much regret the mini-budget … I raised concerns even before I was in cabinet,” Mordant told the BBC in a Sunday interview, adding there were details about the budget “the cabinet was not aware of.”\n\nThe last time the Conservatives held a leadership race – following the demise of Johnson’s government – Truss came first, Sunak second and Mordaunt third.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, has said any candidate must receive at least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2 p.m. local time Monday.\n\nTruss resigned on Thursday, just six weeks into her disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.

Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy.

Usually, big fiscal statements in the UK are audited independently by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But Kwarteng says there was no time for such an audit – a move that stuns financial markets and sends the pound plunging.\n\nChancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveils a \"growth plan\" in the House of Commons on September 23.

In a tweet, he wrote, “The United Kingdom is a great country but we face a profound economic crisis. That’s why I am standing to be Leader of the Conservative Party and your next Prime Minister. I want to fix our economy, unite our Party and deliver for our country.”\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer has already reached the 100-nomination threshold to make it to the voting stage, while Johnson’s allies said the former PM had returned from a holiday in the Caribbean with the intention of joining the race, PA news reported, but he has yet to declare he is standing.\n\nA runoff between the two men could prove divisive for the ruling Conservative party, not least because many of Johnson’s supporters blame Sunak’s resignation in July for sparking the downfall of his government. Some outlets have speculated that the two men could strike some kind of deal.\n\nThe BBC reported that a meeting took place between Johnson and Sunak but “it wasn’t disclosed what they discussed,” while Britain’s PA Media news agency reported the two “were said to be locked in talks late into the evening” Saturday.\n\nSky News, meanwhile, referred to the meeting as a “secret summit.”\n\nSunak and Johnson, if he decides to run, will be up against Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who said Sunday she regretted the so-called “mini budget” that led to economic turmoil in Britain and the resignation of Truss.\n\n“I very much regret the mini-budget … I raised concerns even before I was in cabinet,” Mordant told the BBC in a Sunday interview, adding there were details about the budget “the cabinet was not aware of.”\n\nThe last time the Conservatives held a leadership race – following the demise of Johnson’s government – Truss came first, Sunak second and Mordaunt third.\n\nGraham Brady, the Conservative official responsible for the process, has said any candidate must receive at least 100 nominations from the party’s MPs by 2 p.m. local time Monday.\n\nThe threshold effectively narrows the field of potential candidates to a maximum of three as the party has 357 MPs.\n\nIf only one candidate meets that threshold, they will automatically become leader. Otherwise, the remaining candidates will be put to an online vote by Conservative Party members which will close on Friday October 28.\n\nTruss resigned on Thursday, just six weeks into her disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil. Her successor will be the fifth PM to lead the country since it voted for Brexit in 2016.\n\nKeir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, renewed calls for a general election on Sunday, after claiming people are “fed up to the back teeth” with the Conservative leadership and the consequences of their government’s decisions.\n\n“There is a choice to be made. We need a general election! Let the public into decide… Do they want to continue with this utter chaos, or do they want stability under a Labour government?” Starmer asked during a BBC interview.\n\nFormer Home Secretary Priti Patel on Saturday became one of the most high-profile supporters of Johnson in his quest to become PM. “Boris has the mandate to deliver our elected manifesto and a proven track record getting the big decisions right,” she said in a tweet.\n\nBut his possible return to the top job has split opinions within the Conservative Party, with many lawmakers horrified at the prospect of a second Johnson premiership.\n\nJohnson’s former deputy prime minister and foreign secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, “we cannot go backwards” and pointed out that Johnson still faces a probe into the so-called partygate scandal into illegal gatherings in Downing Street.\n\nThe former PM is expected to appear in the next few weeks before the Commons Privileges Committee which is investigating whether he misled Parliament over the parties, which could potentially see him suspended or expelled as an MP.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hauser Tara Subramaniam", "Jennifer Hauser", "Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}]}

The Des Moines Register will be providing updates as more information becomes available.\n\n5:05 p.m. 'Sun showed the true devastation'\n\nMadison County Sheriff Jason Barnes did not sleep overnight. At 11 a.m. Sunday, Barnes talked to residents just northeast of U.S. HWY 169.\n\nOn Saturday night Barnes had said, “It looked like a bomb went off.” As he was out surveying the damage and talking to residents, he said it was even worse than he initially thought.\n\n“It’s every bit of last night and more,” Barnes said. “Sun showed the true devastation.” - Philip Joens\n\n5:02 p.m. Wedding dress of Cecilia Lloyd, who died in the Winterset tornado, is recovered from the rubble\n\nMichelle McCool lives three houses south on Carver Road of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd’s house. She and her husband watched the tornado go past their house and turn before they lost sight of it. She had never been through a tornado before.\n\n“I thought it was a loud truck coming up the road,” McCool said. “And it got louder, louder. You could see the debris in the clouds as it went over.”\n\nVolunteers at the Lloyd’s house treated McCool like the foreperson there. McCool kept the most precious personal belongings found — a film reel, social security cards, a Bible and even glassware that survived without breaking — in her pickup truck. She coordinated with people who had questions and occasionally gave out orders. The son of Cecilia and Tom Lloyd was in the hospital with his dad. Cecilia was one of six in Winterset who died as a result of the tornado.\n\nAround 2:30 p.m., a volunteer found Cecilia Lloyd’s wedding dress wrapped in a garment bag. McCool placed the old lace dress in the passenger seat of her pickup and couldn’t help but tremble.\n\n“That’s sad,” McCool said as she choked up. “Especially knowing she didn’t make it.\n\n“That’s the tough stuff. It’s the personal side of it, you know?”\n\nWinterset residents, including McCool, said that the community spirit shown Sunday felt important. People came from as far away as Pella, New Sharon and Pleasant Hill to clean up.\n\n“It brings you tears,” McCool said. “You always hear about the bad in the world, (then) you see this. There are good people. This is what matters.” - Philip Joens\n\n4:39 p.m. MidAmerican reports fewer than 1,000 still without power\n\nAbout 800 customers are still without power primarily in the southern and southeastern parts of the Des Moines metro, said MidAmerican Media Relations Manager Geoff Greenwood.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m., 558 of those customers are in Des Moines and greater Polk County and 157 are in Norwalk and greater Warren County. At its peak Saturday, MidAmerican reports that about 10,500 customers were affected.\n\nSunday night's anticipated snowfall may slow crews down, with some residents expected to be without power through at least tomorrow, Greenwood said.\n\n4:17 p.m. A meaningful treehouse stood no chance during Saturday's tornadoes\n\nSheltering in their basement during Saturday's tornadoes, Von and Chris Miller of Pleasant Hill had no idea what kind of damage their property would sustain.\n\nNow, on Sunday, friends and family have gathered to help the Millers clean up downed trees and the wreckage that remains of the family's gazebo and treehouse. This was the first tornado the couple had experienced while living in their Pleasant Hill home, but both were prepared for the storms.\n\n\"We both grew up on farms in Iowa,\" Chris Miller said. \"If it wasn't like right outside your house, you just stood outside and watched it.\"\n\nThe Millers lost power around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and expect to be without power for a couple weeks, as several of the utility poles holding power lines in their neighborhood either snapped or were leveled completely.\n\nMORE: As they clean up, Iowans share harrowing stories of destruction, survival from Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather\n\n\"We are very fortunate and very lucky that our house is still livable,\" Von said. \"The neighbors lost their roof, two houses down she lost her whole house. It was on a slab and it's just gone.\"\n\nWhile their house took less severe damage, the treehouse destroyed in the tornado held special meaning for the family.\n\n\"We'll probably put something out there (to replace it),\" Von said. \"The sad thing is, when we added onto this house, we had an old two-story garage that was kind of pulling off. Our daughter asked what we were going to do with it.\n\n\"My daughter and I tore it down, pulled all the nails out, salvaged all the wood and built a two-story treehouse. And now that's gone. It's kind of sad.\"\n\nParts of the treehouse and gazebo were blown onto neighboring property, and pieces of neighbors' property are now in the Millers' yard. - Grace Altenhofen\n\n4:12 p.m. NWS Des Moines says to be prepared for winter weather Sunday night\n\nPeak snowfall will occur between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. from Sunday night to early Monday morning. \"Be prepared for possible slick roads,\" NWS said in a tweet.\n\nMORE: What is a 'wedge' tornado and did we see one in Iowa on Saturday?\n\nThe most amount of snow is predicted to happen in southeast Iowa, although Winterset and Chariton, two of the cities most affected by Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather, are included in the NWS map.\n\n3:45 p.m. Winterset boys basketball plays in the state tournament Tuesday. On Sunday, they were cleaning up tornado damage\n\nWhen a devastating tornado hit Winterset Saturday, members of the Winterset Huskies boys basketball team sprang to action.\n\nTuesday at 3:45 p.m., No. 4 seed Winterset (19-5) will play No. 5 seed Marion (19-5) in the Class 3A boys state basketball tournament at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines.\n\nSunday, however, the Huskies were far from the court, at the home of Cecilia Lloyd, 72, who was killed in the tornado.\n\nAn overturned Cadillac rested where a three-car garage used to be. Photos, statues, video tapes and other knick-knacks sat scattered across the property Cecilia Lloyd shared with her husband Tom Lloyd, who was seriously injured.\n\nWinterset head coach Josh Henry picked up personal belongings shortly after arriving at about 1:30 p.m. Henry and other Huskies never imagined they’d be working in the mud on a bitterly cold day in Winterset three days before their state tournament appearance.\n\nBut at Cecilia Lloyd’s home, life humbled Henry and his players.\n\n“It’s way more than basketball. We preach that to our guys anyway,” Henry said. “This is real life seeing that play out. Picking up clothes and personal belongings, it shows you that life is way more than basketball or any sport.”\n\nThe stakes Tuesday at Wells Fargo Arena will be high. Henry and his team want to win. But this is life, he said. That's so, so much more important. Brayden Dinkla, one of Winterset's players, told the Register a cheerleader's house was destroyed, as was the house of an uncle of one of the players.\n\n“We as a society put so much emphasis on sports,\" Henry said. \"But things like this help everyone open their eyes up.”\n\nMORE: See photos and videos of damage from the tornadoes and severe weather that swept through Iowa on Saturday\n\nSenior Blake Bellamy is a forward for Winterset. He met up with Henry and several of his teammates at 1 p.m. to clean up at houses around Winterset.\n\nLike his teammates, Bellamy is excited for Tuesday. When the tornado hit Saturday, he was in Des Moines. Bellamy echoed his coach’s sentiment that this showed the importance of sports as an escape, but that they also have their place.\n\n“At the end of the day basketball is just basketball. This is real life stuff that needs to be done before basketball,” Bellamy said. “Basketball doesn’t come first when stuff like this happens.”\n\n3:20 p.m. Red Haw State Park in Chariton has extensive damage and will be closed for the time being\n\nIowa DNR spokesperson Tammie Krausman said there was extensive damage to trees, a few beach docks and then campground, where a woman was ultimately killed at Red Haw State Park in Chariton, Iowa.\n\nTwo shelters and a storage building are \"pretty much demolished,\" she said.\n\nKrausman said they still don't know the full extent of damage. The park is closed and she doesn't know when it will reopen at this time.\n\n2:53 p.m. Names of 6 people who died from Winterset tornado released\n\nAccording to Iowa State Patrol Sergeant Alex Dinkla, they are:\n\nMelissa Bazley, 63\n\nRodney Clark, 64\n\nCecilia Lloyd, 72\n\nMichael Bolger, 37\n\nKinlee Bolger, 5\n\nOwen Bolger, 2\n\nThere also also six more people being treated for their injuries, according to Dinkla.\n\n2:38 p.m. Carver Road in Winterset is closed; Winterset school bus transporting volunteers to help\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said Carver Road is closed and that they have a Winterset school bus picking up volunteers and transporting them to clean-up areas to keep traffic off the road.\n\n\"Today, as we're talking, people are out there picking up debris, using chainsaws because they wanted to help,\" Ayala said.\n\n2:31 p.m. Official says warning system worked 'really well'\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said he thinks the weather warning system in the county worked “really well.\"\n\n\"I know for my agency, my office, we sent out about three or four notifications,\" he said. \"Even when the tornado warning came through, we sent out a quick alert.\n\n\"We did our best to make sure everyone was aware of what was going on before the storm and after the storm as well.\"\n\n2:28 p.m. Official says Winterset tornado affected 52 homes, spanned 13.7 miles\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said the EF-3 tornado that struck Winterset spanned over 13.7 miles damaged or destroyed 52 homes.\n\n\"I cannot express the heroism of the responders that were out there last night and worked tirelessly across the state to make sure that every single person that was missing is accounted for,\" Ayala said, \"and worked to really make sure that we can get up this morning to do the exact same thing again.\"\n\n2:20 p.m. Gov. Reynolds says FEMA is ready to help after Iowa tornado damage\n\nReynolds she heard from Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Department of Homeland Security this morning and he had already reached out to FEMA, which stands ready if there’s anything they need to do.\n\nMadison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said American Red Cross Madison County has an emergency shelter set up at Newbridge Church in Winterset for anyone needing assistance.\n\n2:10 p.m. Gov. Kim Reynolds teared up when talking about volunteers after touring Iowa tornado damage in Winterset\n\n\"Lastly before I turn it over, (I want to) just to talk about the number of volunteers; 200-300 Iowans not only from Madison County and Winterset but from communities and towns all across the state that were on the ground the minute it was light and they started helping.\"\n\n\"Over and over the response was 'We’re Iowans. That’s what we do. We show up. We take care of our family. We take care of our neighbors. We take care of our community.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of Iowans and the way that they always step up and respond and I'm so proud of local leaders and the coordination that takes place every time we have an emergency disaster.\"\n\n2:03 p.m. Kim Reynolds calls the damage in Winterset 'devastating'\n\nDuring her 2 p.m. press conference following a tour of damage from the Winterset tornado, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds opened by calling the damage \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It was unimaginable the destruction we were able to witness on the brief tour we just went through,\" she said.\n\n1:31 p.m. Saturday's formation could be a 'wedge' tornado\n\nA tornado that hit Madison County in Iowa Saturday and killed six people there was so wide it could be considered a wedge tornado.\n\nThe term is pretty subjective and based on appearances, said National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Krull. There aren't any exact measurements that define a wedge tornado, only that the formation is very large — typically short and wide.\n\nThe Register has more information on wedge tornadoes online.\n\n1:17 p.m. Faith Mathews felt the tornado pulling her away as she ran inside\n\nAt the end of a particularly hard-hit stretch of Southeast Sixth Avenue in Runnells, a long line of 120-foot high MidAmerican highline wooden power lines were toppled, prohibiting people who wanted to help about six neighbors whose homes and barns were severely damaged in the storm.\n\nFaith Mathews said she and her husband David had just returned home on Saturday around 4:30 p.m. and were assessing the weather when they both heard the wind making a strange sound.\n\nDavid yelled at Faith from outside the house to get down into the basement.\n\nFaith said she could feel the tornado pulling her away from the house as she made her way down toward the basement. She covered their dog with her body. David covered them both with his.\n\nWhen they finally were able to get up, their home was completely destroyed.\n\nThe tornado tore the roof off the three-bedroom home and crumbled the brick walls. The Mathews’ coffee business, American Pride Roasters, which sells beans at the downtown Des Moines Farmers Market, also was destroyed. A Lance camper the couple purchased last fall sat upside down on the couple’s Corvette. Two Ford pickups also were damaged. The house was uninhabitable.\n\n“You just think this isn’t real,” said Faith Mathews, who is 45. “I don’t know how I feel really. I think I’m still in a lot of shock.”\n\nBy noon Sunday, numerous people had reached out to help the neighbors along Southeast Sixth Ave, though many could not get near the homes and farms.\n\n“It’s so amazing how people reach out,” Faith Mathews said. “We’ll rebuild. It’s all we can do.”\n\nIn the farm field next to the Mathews home, corn stalks were bent to the ground toward the east, the direction of the tornado. Grain wagons from a five-generation farm a half mile away were tossed around like children’s toys.\n\nThe grain wagons belonged to Tim Fritz, who lost his 180-year-old barn, original to the family farm he grew up on, when the tornado tore through from the 8400 block to 9300 block of Southeast Sixth.\n\nDowned trees and other debris also lay in the field. Fritz and his girlfriend Julie were hauling cattle to southwest Iowa when the tornado hit, they said.\n\nAt Four Mile Elementary School, members of the Red Cross, the Polk County Sheriff’s Department, Pleasant Hill Fire Department and other volunteers stood by to help families who stopped in infrequently needing help.\n\nBut most neighbors who were affected, as well as their family and their friends, were busy cleaning up the widespread damage on their properties as snow was forecast to hit the area by evening. - Lee Rood\n\n1:10 p.m. Professor estimates $1 billion in damages after Iowa tornado, severe weather\n\nNorthern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini told the Associated Press that Saturday's tornadoes and severe weather across Iowa, combined with wind damage as far away as Illinois, likely caused more than $1 billion in damages.\n\n1:02 p.m. 'It was so loud, it was quiet. I don't know how else to describe it.'\n\nJosie Carter and her father Chad Carter rode out the Winterset tornado in the basement of their home on top of a tall hill about a mile northeast of U.S. HWY 169. On Sunday morning, a small army of volunteers helped them clean up what remained of their home.\n\n“It was so loud, it was quiet,” Josie Carter, 17, said. “I don’t know how else to describe it. I could hear it was a big wind storm, then so much was going on. It just went quiet and still. I want to say that was the eye.”\n\n“I just remember the pressure,” Chad Carter added.\n\nThey narrowly survived, they said.\n\n“I was able to get to the basement and the door slammed because of the wind, but (my dad) was still at the bottom of the stairs. He didn’t quite get into the basement. So I thought he was gone,” Josie Carter said.\n\nThe Carters moved into the home about eight years ago. On Sunday morning, they found a few pictures and keepsakes among the rubble.\n\n“No treasures yet,” Chad Carter said. - Philip Joens\n\n12:54 p.m. Description of a man being inside a Chariton camper that was thrown into the air\n\nThe owner of Country Cabins in Chariton, Nick Cattell, told the Register a man was in one of his campers when it was propelled in the air by a tornado Saturday.\n\n12:48 p.m. HyVee offers meals to impacted families\n\nEmergency centers are continuing to serve impacted areas Sunday. In Winterset, the New Bridge Church is open as a shelter. A nearby Casey's also stayed open through the night to help first responders.\n\nIn Polk County, Four Mile Elementary has been set up as a temporary hub for the Red Cross. HyVee will be serving free lunches to staff, families and emergency personnel starting at 1 p.m.\n\nThe Red Cross has asked for cash donations at this time. They are not in need of clothing or food right now.\n\n12:38 p.m. Kim Reynolds is in Winterset\n\nIowa's governor is in Winterset to survey the damage from the tornado that killed six and damaged 25-30 homes on Saturday. She is expected to hold a press conference at 2 p.m.\n\n12:25 p.m. 'It’s like God came down, rolled the trailer into a ball and threw it back down to the ground'\n\nNorm Paulsen Sr. said he could see the tornado’s path.\n\nThe house across the street with its garage replaced with a pile of rubble, the snapped trees on his property — he imagined that destruction happened before the tornado made a direct hit on Paulsen’s dream, the Soda Pop Saloon.\n\nFor over 20 years the saloon had been a place where families in Chariton and beyond would come together, laugh and dance line, two and three step, polka and waltz without alcohol. A place where children could “get their fingers off them damn contraptions,” as Paulsen puts it.\n\nAnd throughout the years, he said he’s always heard the phrase: “I wish I had something like this in my hometown.” People didn’t think his dream could fly, he said, but it did.\n\n“It’s the neatest place in southern Iowa,” Paulsen, 83, said of his western rustic-meets-retro establishment. Old CDs, guitars, western posters and cowboy hats still don the panels and walls of what’s left of the structure.\n\nBut the Soda Pop Saloon wasn’t hit the hardest on his property, which is called the Frontier Trading Post. It stood upright, despite a large swath of its roof blown off. Next door, the family’s antique barn, was destroyed.\n\nAnd just a little further, trailers, a large Conex cargo container and fishing merchandise propelled from the tornado laid scattered across the family’s 8-acre property, hundreds of feet away from where they should be.\n\n“It’s like God came down, rolled the trailer into a ball and threw it back down to the ground,” said Cindy Reyes, Paulsen’s daughter, of their Diamond Trio trailer discovered upside down in trees, crushed and crumpled.\n\nThe Diamond Trio is a country band Paulsen started with his sister, Charlotte, and Reyes – another one of Paulsen’s dreams.\n\nOn Sunday, the Paulsen family came together to asses the damage and make sure their loved ones were accounted for. Humor plays a large part in the family’s make up – Norm Paulsen Jr. says he gets his bad jokes from his father – and to cope with the loss, they cracked jokes with one another.\n\nBut when Norm Paulsen Sr. drove up to the property, it was quiet.\n\nHis brother, Richard Roberts, 67, warned him: “It’s even worse out back – you will never imagine the devastation.\"\n\nIt took a few minutes for Paulsen Sr. to collect himself.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

Mayor Randall Woodfin said the metro area did benefit from the 11-day Olympics-style competition. But he also joined council members in criticizing a lack of transparency about the finances of the event, which featured sports ranging from parachuting to billiards. “I know each of you enough to know this sucks,” Mayor Randall Woodfin told the council at their meeting Tuesday. “I feel the same way you feel.” The World Games lost $2.5 million in expected sponsorships in May, and ticket sales fell about 200,000 short of projections, said Nick Sellers, chief executive of the World Games Organizing Committee. While expenses were lower than projected, the lack of revenue still caused a budget crunch, he said. More than 100 companies or individuals, many of them from Alabama, are owed about $15 million, officials said. Some area companies also complained about a decline in business during the event, which didn’t draw the expected number of international visitors during its run July 7-17. The Birmingham games marked only the second time a U.S. city played host to the World Games in its four-decade-long existence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. House candidate Tara Sweeney said Tuesday that she plans to end her campaign, saying she does not see a path to victory or to raise the resources needed to be successful in the November general election. Sweeney was positioned in fourth place after last week’s U.S. House primary as elections officials continued to count ballots. But she was far behind the top finishers, Democrat Mary Peltola and Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, who were already poised to advance to the November general election. An election process approved by voters in 2020 calls for the top four vote-getters in a primary to advance to the general election, in which ranked-choice voting will be used. Tiffany Montemayor, a spokesperson with the state Division of Elections, said if a candidate who advances from the primary withdraws 64 or more days before the general election, the fifth-place candidate would advance instead. She said that determination would come after the Sept. 5 withdrawal deadline. Peltola, Palin and Begich also were the three candidates competing in last week’s ranked-choice special election that will determine who serves the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term, which ends early next year. The results of that election aren’t expected until Aug. 31.\n\nArizona\n\nMarana: A massive, beloved cactus has fallen. “Strong-Arm,” a saguaro that stood in the Tortolita Preserve in Marana near Tucson, fell Aug.4 after living for roughly 150 to 200 years, the town said on its website. The 40-foot-tall saguaro, marked with its own metal sign proclaiming its name, had 34 arms in all and was home to many birds, including a great horned owl and some woodpeckers. In the memorial post on Marana’s government website, Jason Grodman, natural resources supervisor with the Marana Parks and Recreation Department, called it a “saguaro motel” to its many animal residents. “It saw all of the development grow up around us, and it’s really a sentinel for the preserve,” Grodman said in a tribute video for the plant. Marana’s recreation superintendent Bob Stinson said his predecessor had given the saguaro its name since it was one of the largest cacti in the area, and the trail went right by it. “It was just a beautiful specimen,” Stinson said. He said, gauging from the many people he had spoken to about it, Strong-Arm would be missed in the community. Grodman said in the video that the trunk of the saguaro, which remains upright, will likely stand for the next few years, while the arms will likely decompose of the course of about five years.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: The attorney for a man seen on video being punched and kneed by officers said Tuesday that the violent arrest is part of an alleged pattern of excessive force by a sheriff’s deputy, and policing experts said some of the blows appeared to be unjustified or even criminal. A bystander’s video of 27-year-old Randal Worcester’s arrest Sunday in the small town of Mulberry sparked outrage after it was posted online. All three officers were later suspended, and state and federal authorities have opened criminal investigations into their actions. It’s the latest case in which increasingly omnipresent cameras have led to consequences for officers and raised questions about what level of force police are justified in using and when. A deputy was caught in the video repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down as a third also kneed him over and over. Carrie Jernigan, an attorney for Worcester, said the deputy who punched him, Levi White, used excessive force against other people she’s representing. “There’s something going on, and we just need to get it addressed,” she said during a Tuesday news conference with the two other clients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Victims who receive unsolicited sexually graphic material by text, email, app or other electronic means could sue the sender under a bill that lawmakers sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. The bill targets what’s known as “cyber flashing,” when victims receive such unwelcome surprises, often from strangers. “Just as individuals suffer sexual harassment and abuse in their physical, non-digital lives, there’s a growing incidence of individuals being harassed by receiving unsolicited, sexually explicit images and videos including from people they do not know,” Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry said when the Assembly approved the bill. The Assembly passed the measure 76-0 last Thursday, and the Senate sent the bill to Newsom on a 37-0 roll call Monday. There was no recorded opposition. The most common recipients are young women, Aguiar-Curry said. The Pew Research Center in a report last year on online harassment found that 33% of women under 35 had been sexually harassed online – three times as often as men. In a 2017 report, the center said more than half of women ages 18-29 had been sent unsolicited explicit images, as had 37% of men in the same age range. The bill would allow recipients to recover at least $1,500 and as much as $30,000 from senders of obscene material.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado businessman charged in a “We Build the Wall” fraud case that once included former presidential adviser Steve Bannon among defendants wants his October retrial moved from New York to Colorado to save money and spare him from what his lawyer says is bias from political polarization he’ll otherwise face. Attorney John Meringolo wrote in papers submitted to a Manhattan federal court judge late Monday that Timothy Shea cannot get a fair and impartial retrial in New York. He also asked that the retrial be moved from Oct. 24 to early December, saying prosecutors have recently produced a previously seized laptop computer taken from Shea’s Castle Rock, Colorado, residence that contains an email exchange not introduced at the first trial, which ended in June with a deadlocked jury. In requesting a change of venue, Meringolo cited what he called the “obviously politically charged atmosphere of the jury room” at the first trial and said the effect of “political polarization” became obvious when the trial ended in a mistrial after 11 jurors tried to force one juror off the panel, saying he possessed political bias. A similar venue-change request was denied before Shea’s first trial. Meringolo said the first trial was an immense financial burden for his client, and a move would enable him to have witnesses who live closer to Colorado testify on his behalf.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A department store security guard who was shot outside a mall was wounded when he struggled with an alleged shoplifter who pulled a handgun on him, according to an arrest warrant affidavit released Monday. The affidavit was released as Richard LaPlante was arraigned in court on attempted murder and other charges in connection with Friday’s shooting outside The Shoppes at Buckland Hills in Manchester. A judge kept the 30-year-old Windsor resident’s bail at $1 million. Tirso Polanco, a 27-year-old loss prevention officer at the Macy’s store at the mall, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized, police said. According to the affidavit, LaPlante fled the mall after the shooting and took a transit bus home. Police said they were able to track and identify him through mall and bus security cameras. LaPlante turned himself in to police Saturday. His next court date was set for Sept. 7. His lawyer, Ronald Johnson, said after Monday’s court hearing that LaPlante “feels bad” about the shooting.“We’re praying for the victim and hope that the victim is OK, and we’re praying for his family,” Johnson said. “And the most important thing is let the judicial process go through its process.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of prisoners has sued the state’s prison system and its private health care contractor, claiming they’ve been left to suffer chronic and sometimes debilitating pain after officials banned certain pain medicines. Aside from complaints involving the pandemic, the lawsuit is the first large-scale litigation filed against Centurion of Delaware, the private health care provider for the state’s prison system. Centurion won a $47 million contract to provide health care for those imprisoned by the state starting in 2020, taking over after years of complaints and scandals involving the prisons’ prior health care provider. The lawsuit names 24 plaintiffs. All but one are currently in a Delaware prison. They each claim that they suffer from chronic pain or nerve damage caused by a range of issues from gunshot wounds to things like degenerative joint and spinal conditions, pain that was treated by medications that were effectively banned by the prison in 2019, the lawsuit says. The suit claims that after that, inadequate alternatives were provided. In some cases, they were given psychiatric drugs or alternative methods such as “distraction” and yoga, which leave the prisoners suffering behind bars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A homeless encampment in Northwest D.C. was cleared Wednesday morning, leaving many people looking for a new location to live, WUSA-TV reports. The National Park Service closed Reservation 70 about 7 a.m. The closure was due to imminent threats to public health and safety from unsheltered encampments in the parks, National Mall and Memorial Parks Chief of Communications Mike Litterst said. The closure will allow for turf rehabilitation, cleaning and maintenance of the park area, and removal of rodent infestation. Fencing will enclose the park and will remain closed while the park is under restoration. There was no information on how long the people who were living there were notified ahead of the closure to make arrangements to relocate. The site is one of many encampments that have been closed to homeless residents in the district this year. Once an encampment is closed, the unhoused people who were living there typically migrate to a different one, which can cause overcrowding.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz as a toddler was intellectually and physically behind other children, which caused him to isolate himself and hit and bite to get what he wanted, a day care administrator and former neighbor testified Tuesday at his penalty trial for mass murder. He remained socially and behaviorally stunted through elementary school, a special education counselor also testified. Cruz’s attorneys began the second day of their defense by building on testimony that his birth mother’s cocaine and alcohol abuse during pregnancy left him severely brain-damaged, putting him on a road that led to him murdering 14 students and three staff members at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. They are trying to persuade his jury to sentence him to life without parole instead of death. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to the murders, and the trial is only to determine his sentence. Prosecutors say no drugs were found in Cruz’s system at birth. The defense says that’s because his birth mother was put in a residential drug rehab program when she was six months pregnant, but the damage had been done. The defense is trying to overcome the prosecution’s case, which featured surveillance video of Cruz mowing down students and staff as he stalked a three-story building for seven-minutes, photos of the aftermath and a jury visit to the building.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMorrow: Two white Atlanta police officers who clashed with Rayshard Brooks acted reasonably during the 2020 encounter that ended with the 27-year-old Black man’s fatal shooting, a specially appointed prosecutor said Tuesday in announcing his decision not to pursue charges against them. Officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Brooks in June 2020, and Officer Devin Brosnan faced a “quickly evolving” situation when Brooks lunged and grabbed one of their Tasers during an arrest attempt, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia. “We did not look at this with 20/20 hindsight. Given the quickly changing circumstances, was it objectively reasonable that he used deadly force? And we conclude it was,” Skandalakis said. The shooting happened against the backdrop of heightened tensions and protests nationwide after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer less than three weeks prior. Sometimes-violent protests had largely subsided in Atlanta, but Brooks’ killing set off a new round of demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. Skandalakis said he believes context is important and acknowledged encounters between police and the African American community are sometimes “very volatile,” but he said he doesn’t believe race played a role in this instance.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distribution company has agreed to pay $90,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging a Black employee was subjected to racial slurs and racist references to slavery, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday. According to the lawsuit, a supervisor at Suisan Co.’s Hilo warehouse shouted racial slurs at the worker, who was fired after complaining to management. A manager who investigated also used a racial epithet during a meeting with the employee, the lawsuit said. During a second meeting, the manager and another supervisor made jokes about slavery, the lawsuit said. The commission alleged in the lawsuit filed last year in U.S. District Court in Honolulu that the man was later fired in retaliation for reporting the harassment. In addition to the money, Suisan agreed to measures to address and prevent discrimination, the commission said, including outlining an internal complaint process and providing anti-discrimination training. “Even though Hawaii is a racially and culturally diverse state, we continue to see race discrimination and harassment complaints filed with our agency in this region,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the commission.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Tuesday called a special session of the Legislature beginning Sept. 1 to use the state’s projected $2 billion budget surplus for a record $500 million income tax rebate this year to help residents deal with increased food and gas prices due to inflation. The Republican governor also proposed an ongoing tax cut of more than $150 million annually by creating a corporate and individual flat tax rate of 5.8% starting next year. The first $2,500 of income for individuals and $5,000 for those filing jointly would be exempt from taxes. Finally, Little wants to bolster K-12 public schools and ongoing education with $410 million annually from sales taxes starting next year. Language in Little’s proclamation calling the special session cites high inflation, currently about 8.5%. “Idaho taxpayers and the education system are especially imperiled by the consequences of historic inflation,” Little’s proclamation said. The proposed bill already has enough co-sponsors in the 70-member House and 35-member Senate to make it to the governor’s desk for his signature. The Legislature would decide when it meets in regular session in January how to spend the education money. Of the $410 million, $330 million is proposed for K-12 and $80 million for ongoing education.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A former prison guard could face life in prison after a jury convicted him Tuesday of violating the civil rights of a 65-year-old inmate who died after correctional officers beat him in a lockup more than four years ago. The jury of six men and six women deliberated about three hours before returning guilty verdicts on five counts against ex-correctional Lt. Todd Sheffler, 54, of Mendon. Sheffler is the second ex-guard convicted in the death of Larry Earvin in May 2018. A separate jury convicted Alex Banta, 31, of similar charges in April. That jury could not reach a verdict on Sheffler, so the government tried him again. “The defense made a statement about the long, cruel arm of government,” assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Miller said in his closing statement. “Todd Sheffler violated his training, violated the U.S. Constitution and allowed, participated in and covered up the brutal beating of a 65-year-old man, defenseless, a fellow citizen, handcuffed behind his back and lying on the cold, hard concrete floor. He was the long, cruel arm of government.” Like Banta, Sheffler was convicted of depriving Earvin of his civil rights, conspiracy to deprive civil rights, tampering with a witness, destruction or falsification of records and intimidation or force against a witness. The civil rights charges alone carry sentences of as much as life in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nLakeville: Democrat Paul Steury has been confirmed as the party’s candidate for the special election to complete the congressional term of Republican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski following her death in a highway crash. Democratic precinct committee members from Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District confirmed Steury’s selection during a caucus vote Tuesday evening in Lakeville. “With Paul Steury, Democrats have an educator and proven community leader who is ready to fight climate change, create more good-paying jobs, and build a better tomorrow for Hoosiers across Indiana’s Second Congressional District,” Indiana Democratic Party Chair Mike Schmuhl said Tuesday night in a statement. Steury is a high school science teacher from Goshen and will face Republican Rudy Yakym and Libertarian William Henry. Yakym won a Republican caucus Saturday to replace Walorski on the November ballot after gaining the endorsement of Walorski’s husband. Yakym, an executive with Elkhart distribution company Kem Krest, will be a heavy favorite to win in the solidly Republican district. All three candidates are running both in the special election to complete Walorski’s term that ends in early January and the regular election for a full two-year term. Both elections will be on the November ballot.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is undertaking an ambitious project to survey the condition of every house in Des Moines. The Property Condition Survey intends to survey more than 50 neighborhoods and 96,000 houses across the city, officials said. The initiative employs coordinators to evaluate properties with a focus on safety, according to SuAnn Donovan, the city’s deputy director of Neighborhood Services. As a part of the survey, coordinators will survey the condition of each property’s roof, siding, windows, fence and gates, porch and balconies, and foundation. Properties are then ranked on a scale of one to five, with one indicating the property is in good condition and five indicating it is in need of repair, according to Donovan. The overall score will help the city and Invest DSM, a neighborhood revitalization project, decide where to invest in next, she said. The survey is being used in the development of a voluntary neighborhood assistance program coined “Improving Our Neighborhoods,” Donovan said. Between 2011 and 2021, developers, homeowners and businesses have invested $2.1 billion in the city’s downtown, supplemented by government tax breaks and incentives. She emphasized that the initiative is voluntary and that the city will not be issuing any violations in regard to the findings of the survey.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An anti-abortion activist is now suing for a complete hand recount of an election in which voters soundly rejected a proposal to remove abortion rights from the state’s constitution. Mark Gietzen is representing himself in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Sedgwick County District Court after a nine-county hand recount that his supporters largely funded wrapped up over the weekend. Fewer than 100 votes changed out of more than 500,000 cast in those counties. The measure failed by about 165,000 votes statewide. Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said in a news release that the recount results should “put to rest the unfounded claims of election fraud.” In the lawsuit, Gietzen alleges without evidence that votes statewide might have been vulnerable to the same type of programming error that initially switched results in a county commission race. The suit also seeks a revote “where necessary.” A judge quickly dismissed a lawsuit Gietzen filed before the election seeking to have ballot drop boxes removed across the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nJackson: In the wake of the worst flooding in eastern Kentucky memory, 59 Breathitt County residents have signed onto a lawsuit against Blackhawk Mining and a contracted company, Pine Branch Mining, alleging nearby strip mining operations amplified the flood damage. Ned Pillersdorf, a local attorney representing the plaintiffs, said a majority of those 59 residents are now homeless, and those who aren’t won’t have access to clean water for months. The mining operations were a “ticking time bomb ready to explode with any type of heavy rainfall,” the filing in Breathitt County Circuit Court alleges. Following the late July flooding, residents said they found fish on their property that would normally reside in the silt ponds of coal mining operations, which the plaintiffs say indicates failure on the part of the coal companies to properly maintain its silt ponds and overall operation. Kentucky Administrative Regulation 20:060 requires coal companies to keep any debris or water from its operation from escaping its property into non-permitted areas, such as the residences below. The filing also accuses the coal companies of failing to continuously reclaim strip mined land, as required under Kentucky Revised Statute 350.100, damaging residents’ water supply, and causing property damage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: About two dozen juvenile inmates at a troubled detention center won’t be moved to the notorious state penitentiary at Angola until at least the middle of next month, as a legal battle over their transfer plays out, officials said Tuesday. The juveniles are currently being held at the Bridge City Center for Youth in Jefferson Parish. Officials have long acknowledged issues at the center, which wasn’t designed to house certain high-risk inmates. There have been at least four escapes this year, as well as a riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. But the plan to move them to Angola has been sharply criticized by criminal justice advocates, former officials and parents of children currently held at the center, The Times-Picayune/The News Orleans Advocate reports. A federal lawsuit to block the state from moving forward with the transfer was filed Friday on behalf of a teenager currently held in Bridge City who is set to be transferred to Angola, the newspaper reports. The defendants in the case – which include Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Office of Juvenile Justice – and their attorneys said Tuesday that they would not transfer any of the inmates until at least Sept. 15. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s public defender system wants to more than double its budget to better represent people who can’t afford an attorney. The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services voted to recommend a $62.1 million budget next year. The proposal would open four public defender offices in the state and raise the hourly fee from $80 to $150 for court-appointed lawyers. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state, but the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine is suing the state, contending there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. The budget request, which will be considered by lawmakers, comes against a backdrop of states grappling with public defender systems across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Texas man was sentenced to six months in federal prison Tuesday for threatening a Maryland doctor who has been a prominent advocate for COVID-19 vaccines, a federal prosecutor said. Scott Eli Harris, 52, of Aubrey, Texas, pleaded guilty in February to threats transmitted by interstate communication. U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron announced the sentence, which will be followed by three years of supervised release, in a news release Wednesday. “While we are all entitled to our own opinion, no one has the right to threaten the life of someone because of race, national origin, or because of holding different views,” Barron said in a statement. “Threats like these will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” According to Harris’ plea agreement and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Harris sent a threatening message from his cellphone to the doctor. Court documents identify the doctor only as “Dr. L.W., who had been a vocal proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine.” Harris’ message included violent statements such as: “Never going to take your wonder drug. My 12 gauge promises I won’t. .… I can’t wait for the shooting to start.” Harris’ message also made reference to the doctor’s Asian American background and national origin.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nKingston: A project underway in the woods of coastal Massachusetts seeks to restore a 32-acre former Catholic summer camp on the banks of the Muddy Pond in Kingston to something closer to what it might have looked like before European colonization transformed it. Through the Wampanoag Common Lands, the Native Land Conservancy – the local Native group that received the donated forestland this year – envisions a natural environment filled with indigenous plants and animals where Wampanoags can practice cultural ceremonies and educate new generations in traditional ways. Ramona Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag who founded the conservancy, said the effort is all the more meaningful because the land is some 5 miles from where Pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower established the English colony of Plymouth, near the remnants of a Wampanoag community wiped out by European disease. “This is basically where the first impact of colonization of this country happened,” she said. “It’s very significant that it’s been returned to us.” The Wampanoag Common Lands is part of a growing movement of Indigenous-led conservation efforts helping to preserve and reinvigorate Native culture and identity, said Beth Rose-Middleton, a professor at the University of California, Davis, focused on Native American environmental policy and conservation.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: University of Michigan researchers are studying how well people with autism spectrum disorder can detect road hazards, and they plan to assist the young motorists in sharpening their driving skills. The upcoming effort will be the second phase of a project funded by Ford Motor Co. that teams the Ann Arbor university with a local driving school. During phase one of the study, researchers found that students with autism spectrum disorder detected fewer hazards than control participants during simulated drives. But lead researcher Elise Hodges said some extra work behind the wheel did the trick. “Those folks that underwent training improved in two-thirds of hazards in the simulated drive,” said Hodges, a clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan’s neuropsychology program. Ann Arbor Academy, a school for students with learning and social differences, hosted driving lessons. Hodges designed the simulated drives and oversaw the study. Ford footed the bill. The goal, in part, was to provide an opportunity for those with autism spectrum disorder to improve their driving skills. “Many of them … would like to drive, but getting from wanting to drive and being able to drive are two different things,” she said. The individualized driving sessions planned for phase two are expected to start in a month or two, Hodges said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEden Prairie: A suburban Minneapolis mall resumed normal business hours Tuesday after a fatal shooting that had earlier locked down the shopping complex. Police responded to the Eden Prairie Center mall Monday night and found a man dead of what they said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooting happened in the Scheels sporting goods store, which also sells firearms. Police Chief Matt Sackett said it’s not clear whether the man brought a weapon to Scheels or accessed one of the store’s guns. “It’s obviously an active and fluid investigation, but again, we do believe it to be an isolated incident. There is not a threat to anybody else in the public,” Sackett said at a briefing. Will Dammann was shopping in Scheels when he heard an alarm sound and a commotion near a door. Seconds later a store announcement told people to evacuate immediately. “So then it was, you know, the hustle bustle of getting out. Then everyone was just standing out in front, and that’s when the police just started rolling in,” Dammann said. He said people seemed calm, including store employees. He did not hear a gunshot, Minnesota Public Radio News reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nLorman: The Honors Curriculum Program at Alcorn State University is being renamed in honor of Myrlie Evers-Williams. The program will be renamed the Myrlie Evers-Williams Honors Program in recognition of the civil rights leader, author and journalist who spent over three decades seeking justice for the 1963 murder of her former husband, Medgar Evers, the university said in a news release. Evers-Williams attended Alcorn A&M College for a year, and there she met and fell in love with Medgar Evers. The two later married in 1951. Alcorn said the honors program attracts academically successful and socially conscious students and assists the university in cultivating global citizen scholars. Evers-Williams expressed her appreciation to the school for recognizing her. “This designation is a special recognition that I hold close to my heart, acknowledging my time on Alcorn’s campus, my life’s work, and my dedication to furthering the fight for equality and human rights,” she said. Alcorn President Dr. Felecia M. Nave praised Evers-Williams’ achievements and said she was proud to recognize the civil rights leader on campus. “She’s an ideal example of the strength, courage, and character that Alcornites exude. We’re thrilled to recognize her for extraordinary contributions and ongoing activism,” Nave said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: John Wood, a Republican running as an independent for U.S. Senate, announced Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the race. Wood said on Twitter that he decided not to challenge Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Democratic nominee Trudy Busch Valentine in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. Wood said he has significant differences with Schmitt and Valentine, but “it has become evident there is not a realistic path to victory for me as an independent candidate.” Wood, a lifelong Republican, former U.S. attorney and most recently a top investigator for the U.S. House committee examining the Jan. 6 riot, said he entered the race when disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens was the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He said it would have been “unacceptable” for Greitens to be Missouri’s new senator. Schmitt soundly defeated Greitens in the Aug. 2 GOP primary. Greitens resigned as governor four years ago after a sex scandal, two criminal charges that were eventually dropped and a legislative investigation that could have led to impeachment hearings. This year, his ex-wife accused him of abuse. Wood’s candidacy was backed by a political action committee led by retired Republican Sen. John Danforth, which spent millions on his campaign.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Visitors to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls will have the unique opportunity Monday to get close to some of Montana’s most powerful predators: hawks, falcons and owls. Educational staff from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks will be in the city with two or three live “ambassador birds” in conjunction with FWP’s Montana WILD program. Three 40-minute programs will give attendees an up-close encounter with the birds, along with insights into what makes raptors unique from other types of birds, why they are so important to our ecosystems, and simple things property owners and recreationalists can do to protect and conserve raptors. “The mission of the ambassador bird program to educate and hopefully get people interested in the outdoors and what we’re doing in terms of conservation,” said Ali Pons, of FWP’s Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. The Montana WILD program is an outgrowth of the work being done at the center in Helena, which takes in injured and orphaned raptors for rehabilitation and release. Montana WILD cares for 15 ambassador birds too injured to be released on their own. “They wouldn’t make it,” Pons said of raptors who’ve become stars of the educational program. “They also have a personality and a demeanor that makes them good education birds.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge has dismissed the discrimination lawsuit of a former Lincoln Police Department spokeswoman, saying her allegations did not sufficiently prove a hostile work environment. Erin Spilker said in her lawsuit that she faced years of discrimination and that the department not only mishandled allegations of sexual assaults by male officers but also disciplined the women who complained. “She is under a microscope, and has been subjected to assaults, harassment, intimidation, threats and retaliation, which affect her ability to do her job,” Spilker’s attorney, Kelly Brandon, said in the complaint. In his order issued Monday, District Judge Kevin McManaman acknowledged Spilker’s string of allegations, from male colleagues making sexualized remarks about female colleagues to suffering various acts of retaliation after she complained, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. But McManaman said, citing case law, that the allegations amounted to “an amalgamation of discrete incidents … and not one unlawful employment practice.” The allegations “are not so similar in nature, frequency and severity as to be considered part and parcel of a hostile work environment,” McManaman wrote. Spilker, who was a 20-year veteran of the department before she resigned earlier this year, is among several female Lincoln police officers who have sued, alleging sex-based discrimination in the department.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new herd of wild horses is descending on the Black Rock Desert for 2022’s Burning Man festival. The Wild Horses of the American West project is rounding up more than a dozen life-size sculptures from local and international artists to bring awareness to environmental concerns surrounding the West’s wild horses. “Everyone loves horses. Wild horses are beautiful,” said organizer Adrian Landon. “But the bottom line is they need to be managed.” A longtime metalwork artist, Landon’s career has largely focused on equine sculptures. In 2019, he created “Wings of Glory,” a giant, flying Pegasus with moving parts now on display in England. This year, Landon had a vision of creating a herd of horses to bring awareness to the plight of Western ecosystems and the need to bring wildlife, plant life and water resources into balance. He put out a call to other artists interested in creating equine art and received dozens of replies. He selected 10 artists and used a grant from Burning Man to help fund their pieces. Now, the herd includes a sculpture from British artist Simon Bellamy, who fashioned a galloping steel piece based on the work of pioneering motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge, and Turburam Sandagdorj, a paper-cutting artist who learned the ancient art from his dad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Continuing with its efforts to close gaps and recover from missed learning, the state Department of Education has selected Tutor.com to provide 24/7 online tutoring for every middle and high school student in the state. Through the partnership, more than 100,000 middle and high school students will gain unlimited access to Tutor.com – anytime, anywhere, from any internet-connected device. The service will be available to students at all New Hampshire schools (public, non-public and charter), as well as students in Home Education and Education Freedom Account programs. “This tutoring will not only facilitate and enhance learning but serve as a tremendous resource for students hoping to enhance their educational experience, or those students in need of individualized instruction. This partnership will also support teachers in their ongoing efforts to assist students who may be struggling and seeking additional guidance,” said Frank Edelblut, the state education commissioner. School districts are being encouraged to register for Tutor.com’s free access for their students; students outside those districts will be able to register individually.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEdison: Mayor Sam Joshi said symbols of hate and discrimination are not welcome in the township, after a piece of construction equipment, viewed as a symbol of hate by the Muslim community, was featured in the Aug. 14 India Day Parade. The parade, from Edison to Woodbridge, marked the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and the division of the South Asian subcontinent into two nations, Hindu-oriented India and Muslim-oriented Pakistan, after years of civil strife. In a statement Monday, Joshi said Edison is committed to celebrating and working in harmony with people from all cultures. But an American-Islamic relations group said it’s disappointed the mayor has not gone further in rebuking the parade organizers, whom the group called to apologize. The parade, organized by the Indian Business Association, featured a piece of construction equipment with the photos of political leaders in India, who are described as proponents of hate against Muslims and other minorities, according to Azra Baig, chair of the South Brunswick’s Human Relations Commission. In India, Baig noted, homes, businesses and houses of worship are being bulldozed because of people’s faith and when they stand up for their rights. “Something this hateful should never be included in a parade in Edison,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will no longer deny licenses to practice law solely because of an applicant’s citizenship or immigration status, including some aspiring law students who arrived in the U.S. as children and don’t have a clear path to citizenship. Announced Monday, the rule change from the New Mexico Supreme Court is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. Several states already have provisions that disregard residency or immigration status in licensure decisions. “The change in the licensure rule is grounded in the fundamental principle of fairness, and is consistent with New Mexico’s historical values of inclusion and diversity,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Shannon Bacon said in a statement Tuesday. She said the shift aligns New Mexico with recommendations by the American Bar Association and provisions in at least eight other states that provide attorney licensing to some immigrants. All applicants are still required to graduate from law school, pass the bar exam and undergo further character vetting by a board of bar examiners. The rulemaking drew immediate criticism from state Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce, at a time when GOP candidates are challenging two incumbent state Supreme Court justices in the November general election.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is headed to Harvard this fall as a teaching fellow at the university’s schools of government and public health. De Blasio, a Democrat who served as mayor from 2014 to 2021, will take part in “a variety of discussions, events, and programming” at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School and will teach classes on leadership and public service at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the schools said in separate announcements Wednesday. Dean Michelle A. Williams cited the former mayor’s time grappling with public health crises including COVID-19, homelessness and the opioid epidemic. Setti Warren, interim director of the Institute of Politics, said de Blasio’s “decades of experience in local government, federal agencies, national campaigns, and running the largest city in the country will provide invaluable insight to our students and the Harvard community.”De Blasio, who grew up in Massachusetts and is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, was prevented by term limits from seeking a third four-year term as mayor. After an unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, de Blasio flirted this year with running for governor of New York and later mounted a brief run for a congressional district that includes his Brooklyn home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a local district attorney from prosecuting state Attorney General Josh Stein or anyone else for his 2020 campaign ad through a criminal libel law. The majority of a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the request by Stein’s campaign committee and others associated with his campaign to prevent enforcement of the law while they sue to attempt to have the law overturned as unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision came the day after a Wake County grand jury formally asked the Wake district attorney’s office to submit an indictment against Stein and two of his advisers or any one of the three for jurors to consider. Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman said Monday that could have happened as soon as next month. Any formal charges could harm the political future of Stein, a Democrat and possible 2024 gubernatorial candidate. The law, which dates back to at least 1931, makes it a misdemeanor to circulate “derogatory reports” about a candidate with the intent of hurting that candidate’s chances in the election. Stein’s Republican opponent in 2020, Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill, cited the law while demanding that the board investigate a political ad that accused the Republican of letting more than a thousand rape kits go untested. O’Neill said the ad was false because police agencies, not prosecutors, are responsible for testing the kits.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A school board reversed course on its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at its monthly meetings, following complaints from conservative lawmakers and an angry backlash from citizens around the country. Seven of the nine members of the Fargo Board of Education, including four newcomers who took office in June, voted earlier this month to cancel a previous board edict that was approved a couple of months before the election. The new board agreed with member Seth Holden, who said the pledge did not align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code in part because the phrase “under God” does not include all faiths. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum last week promoted new legislation that would require public schools and governing bodies to administer the pledge without mandating that people recite it. Republican state Rep. Pat Heinert, a retired county sheriff, is suggesting that sanctions be put in place for public boards and commissions that don’t require the patriotic oath. Angry emails and voicemails dominated Thursday’s special meeting to reconsider the vote. Nyamal Dei, a refugee who fled war-torn Sudan, played a profanity-laced voicemail from a man who called her a slave, racist and Nazi. Several board members apologized to Dei, the lone Black member on the board, for taking the worst of the abuse. Dei said reversing the decision would be giving in to hate. She paused for several seconds before casting the lone “no” vote to reinstate the pledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A strike by teachers in the state’s largest school district entered its third day Wednesday – the first day of school for some 47,000 students, with some of those students and their parents rallying to their sides. Parents, students, teachers and other employees gathered at schools across the Columbus School District with plans to picket for hours, advocating for safer buildings, better heating and air conditioning, smaller class sizes, and a more well-rounded curriculum that includes art, music and physical education. It’s the union’s first strike in the district since 1975. Picketers blasted music on the sidewalks outside Whetstone High School in Columbus and waved to honking drivers. Some held up signs reading:“Columbus schools deserve working air,” “a history lesson in progress,” and “my feet hurt but I’ll walk as long as it takes.” The school district and the union resumed bargaining Wednesday afternoon. The school board said its offer to the union put children first. The Ohio Education Association said more than 94% of the Columbus Education Association members voted to reject the school board’s final offer late Sunday. The union represents more than 4,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and other employees, though it isn’t clear how many of those 4,000 members were not on the job Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday rejected clemency for a man facing execution Thursday for the 1997 hammer killing of a Choctaw man, despite a recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that his life be spared. James Coddington was convicted and sentenced to die for the beating death of a friend and co-worker, 73-year-old Albert Hale, inside Hale’s Choctaw home. Prosecutors say Coddington, who was 24 at the time, became enraged when Hale refused to give him money to buy cocaine. Coddington’s execution is scheduled for Thursday morning. “After thoroughly reviewing arguments and evidence presented by all sides of the case, Governor Kevin Stitt has denied the Pardon and Parole Board’s clemency recommendation for James Allen Coddington,” Stitt’s office said in a statement. During a clemency hearing this month before the state’s five-member Pardon and Parole Board, an emotional Coddington, now 50, apologized to Hale’s family and said he is a different man today. “I’m clean; I know God; I’m not … I’m not a vicious murderer,” Coddington told the board. “If this ends today with my death sentence, OK.” Coddington’s attorney, Emma Rolls, said Coddington doesn’t have any pending appeals that would delay or stop his execution Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: The Klamath Irrigation District in southern Oregon plans to defy a U.S. government order issued last week for a halt to water deliveries to farmers in the drought-stricken basin. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation manages the Klamath Project, which includes Klamath Irrigation District and serves 266 square miles of farmland around the Oregon-California border. A limited allocation of water was allowed for irrigators from Upper Klamath Lake this year because of extreme drought. The bureau has said the project is now out of water and ordered a shutdown last week, but irrigation district directors met Monday and authorized the district’s manager, Gene Souza, to continue operations, the Capital Press reports. The district operates a canal that provides water to nine irrigation districts encompassing about 191 square miles. Souza said in a letter to Alan Heck, acting area manager for the U.S. agency, that it has not provided a legal basis for shutting down the project and that doing so would deny farmers of the water they have legal rights to receive. “I am not doing my duty if I just comply because I do not have a legal justification to deny the people I serve their property,” Souza told the Capital Press.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State elections officials said Wednesday that a push last week to recruit new poll workers produced more than 1,100 applicants, including at least one in 58 of 67 counties. The effort tied to Help America Vote Day, organized by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, brought in the most applicants in some of the populous suburbs of Philadelphia – 221 in Montgomery County, 132 in Chester and 91 in Delaware. Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, drew 100 applicants, while Philadelphia brought in 47. In central Pennsylvania, Lancaster received 71 applications, Dauphin 40 and Cumberland 39. Poll workers, often older people, are paid to help run elections in some 9,000 polling places across the state, but it has been a challenge to recruit and train sufficient numbers of them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poll worker shortages predate the pandemic, however, in part because their work can require 14- or 16-hour days. Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said the influx of 1,146 new candidates was a welcome boost. Some counties promoted the recruitment drive last week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new report suggests ways the city can atone for its extensive ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and centuries of racism and discrimination by, among other things, establishing home repair funds, launching financial literacy programs, and boosting aid to Black and Indigenous organizations. The report, issued Monday by the Providence Municipal Reparations Commission, notably doesn’t recommend giving out direct payments to Black and Native American residents, as some had called for. Instead, it defines “reparations” as efforts that close the “present-day racial wealth and equity gaps,” and it outlines 11 areas for the city to focus its reparations work, including criminal justice reform, neighborhood development, health equity, and improving educational and cultural opportunities. Providence’s reparations effort was launched the same year Rhode Island voters approved a ballot referendum getting rid of the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name because of its slavery connotations. The new report suggests creating a dedicated fund to support residents touched by urban renewal policies that displaced and negatively affected communities of color. It also calls for forgiving certain municipal court debts; ending police use of so-called no-knock warrants; decriminalizing consumption of alcohol in public; and creating a school curriculum based on the city’s research into its racist and discriminatory policies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A showdown between defense attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh who say prosecutors are unfairly withholding evidence and prosecutors who want the defense to agree to secrecy rules first is heading for a courtroom next week. In their latest court filing, defense lawyers said the secrecy rules as Murdaugh awaits a murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and younger son are hypocritical because prosecutors are leaking evidence to media outlets, including a video the leaker said was taken not long before the killings. Prosecutors, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, denied the leaks last week. A hearing about the matter is scheduled for Monday at the Colleton County courthouse, where defense attorneys want the murder trial to take place in January. The cellphone video from Murdaugh’s son included Murdaugh talking to his wife outside the family’s Colleton County home where the killings happened, said defense lawyers, who said they hadn’t been given the video, but it was shown to Murdaugh’s family by state agents. The leaked media reports did not include that the conversation was friendly and about dogs, the defense said. Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian said the state contends that Murdaugh killed his wife and son “for no apparent reason” within minutes of the light-hearted conversation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota is joining other states in filing an amicus brief in defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The friend of the court brief involves the U.S. Supreme Court case Brackeen v. Haaland, which challenges the act that establishes federal standards for placement of Native American children in foster of adoptive homes. The act seeks to give the child’s family and tribe the opportunity to be involved in decisions from which they previously may have been excluded, including placement and services. Arguments in the case are scheduled before the high court this November. Stephanie Amiotte, legal director for the South Dakota ACLU, said if the court overturns the law, it could be devastating for tribes. “ICWA was enacted by Congress to address a situation where disproportionate numbers of Indian children were being removed from their homes, and eventually a disproportionate number of them were being adopted into white families,” Amiotte told South Dakota Public Broadcasting. The act’s opponents say the race-based policy is unconstitutional. Amiotte said keeping Indigenous children connected to their culture improves outcomes. “Native American Children have been essentially invisible within the American society,” Amiotte said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district has resigned as he was being investigated by an outside attorney for allegations that he abused his power and violated policies. The Shelby County School Board accepted the resignation of Joris Ray during a specially called meeting Tuesday evening, officials said in a news release. Ray was appointed to lead Memphis-Shelby County Schools in 2019, and he had worked in the district for more than 24 years. The board had suspended Ray during an investigation stemming from allegations made in divorce proceedings between Ray and his wife, who is also a school district employee. A board resolution says it took action “to review the allegations to determine whether Superintendent Ray, during his tenure as Superintendent, engaged in relationships with District employees violative of MSCS policies.” The investigation was being led by former U.S. Attorney Edward L. Stanton III. In a statement posted on Twitter, Ray thanked colleagues for their “many, many small but powerful acts of devotion and commitment.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas officials have accused the state’s most populous county of defunding some of its law enforcement agencies in violation of a new law that prevents such funding cuts. In a letter sent Monday, Texas Comptroller Glen Hegar alleged leaders in Harris County, where Houston is located, reduced funding for the offices of its constables in the current fiscal year and would again reduce funding next year. Harris County officials pushed back against the claims they were defunding law enforcement, saying they have actually increased funding, proposing a budget for the next fiscal year that would allocate $1.4 billion for justice and safety – which is 75% of the county’s budget and the most ever allocated by the county for public safety. Hegar accused the county of ending a policy that would have let the constables’ offices automatically roll over unspent departmental funds from one fiscal year to the next, resulting in a loss of more than $3 million. He also accused the county of reducing funding for the constables by up to $12 million for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Constables and their deputies are licensed peace officers who have the same powers as regular police officers but also have the added responsibility of civil law enforcement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican state leaders sued the Biden administration Wednesday over the president’s decision last year to restore two sprawling national monuments on rugged lands sacred to Native Americans that ex-President Donald Trump had downsized. The lawsuit over Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments alleges President Joe Biden’s action violates the authority granted in a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historically, geographically or culturally important. The legal argument has been repeated for years by Republicans, and the legal challenge had been expected since Biden made the move in October 2021. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a years­long debate spanning three presidential administrations about proper protections of lands that include ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. Trump’s decision to cut them in size opened them for mining and other development, although market dynamics kept that in check. “President Biden made no attempt to explain how 3.23 million acres constituted the ‘smallest area compatible with the proper care and management’ of these supposed monuments,” the lawsuit claims, citing the 1906 Antiquities Act outlining rules for designating national monuments.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A woman was attacked by a black bear over the weekend while walking her two dogs on trails on her Strafford property, the state Fish and Wildlife Department reported Tuesday. The 61-year-old woman was treated at Gifford Medical Center in Randolph on Saturday for non-life-threatening injuries, including a bite wound on her leg and multiple scratches, the department said. Fish and Wildlife game wardens and a bear biologist visited the site and concluded that the bear was a female with cubs who was likely provoked when the woman and her dogs surprised the group. They were unable to find the bear and say such attacks are extremely rare in the state. At the time of the attack, the woman had called her two dogs, who were out of sight, when she heard a large noise and realized a bear was charging her, officials said. She told game wardens that she tripped on a stone wall as the bear was charging her and then realized the animal was on top of her and had bitten her. The woman said her Jack Russell terrier barked at the bear, prompting the animal to get off her. She said she left with her dogs without seeing the bear again and called 911 when she got home. She also texted a neighbor to take her to the hospital.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A ratepayer protection that state regulators included in a recent order approving Dominion Energy Virginia’s application to build and recover the costs of a massive offshore wind farm would force the utility to scrap the project, Dominion said in a filing this week. The State Corporation Commission granted approval this month for the 176-turbine, multibillion-dollar project off Virginia Beach. Dominion immediately raised concerns about the commission’s inclusion of a performance guarantee for the wind farm and in a petition Monday asked the regulators to reconsider that element of their order. Dominion “shares the Commission’s concern, as expressed in the Final Order, that the Project be constructed and operated in a way that reasonably mitigates risk for its customers. The Commission’s unprecedented imposition of an involuntary performance guarantee condition on its approvals, however, is untenable,” the filing said. “As ordered, it will prevent the Project from moving forward, and the Company will be forced to terminate all development and construction activities.” The commission’s Aug. 5 order included three “consumer protections,” including the performance guarantee, which it said would protect customers who are paying for the wind farm “from also having to pay for replacement energy if the Project does not generate the amount of electricity upon which Dominion bases its request and its cost estimates.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An analysis of Washington State Ferries data shows ferries are running behind schedule this year more than they have in the past decade, with a consistent decline in on-time performance. Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling told The Seattle Times that with 50% more passengers traveling by ferry in the summer, it is not unusual to see a dip in on-time performance from June to September. But the delays are more pronounced this year, and passengers on the Anacortes/San Juans route face particular problems, according to WSF data. While this route usually records more delays than others, in June, nearly half of all sailings on this route ran behind schedule. The newspaper reports that was a 40 percentage point gap from WSF’s target to run on time for 95% of trips. WSF attributes the lower on-time performance to a staffing shortage and a higher number of passengers on busy routes. On weekends, especially holiday weekends like Labor Day, passengers on popular tourist routes such as Anacortes/San Juans and Port Townsend/Coupeville are more likely to face delays on Thursday and Friday afternoons leaving the Seattle area and returning on Sunday and Monday afternoons. As of July this year, WSF had a 6% decline in staffing since 2019, when it was running at full capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A cleanup project is planned for the Kanawha River next month. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan is sponsoring the 32nd annual Great Kanawha River Cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon Sept. 10. Cleanup sites will be in Kanawha, Putnam and Fayette counties. Anyone who wants to volunteer should register with the department at (800) 322-5530 or christopher.j.cartwright@wv.gov. Bags and gloves will be provided for volunteers, and REAP will arrange for the trash to be hauled away. Volunteers will receive a T-shirt. Last year, 59 volunteers helped remove 1.9 tons of litter and 301 tires from five sites along the Kanawha River.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has rejected a motion by the Milwaukee Police Department that sought to dismiss a case brought by two city residents who claimed their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested near a memorial site for a Black man fatally shot by an officer in 2016. The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin is representing the residents, including Jarrett English and a plaintiff who did not wish to be named. They were arrested Aug. 30, 2016, in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood, where police killed Sylville Smith approximately two weeks earlier. The 23-year-old Smith, who was armed, was running from police who suspected him of dealing drugs. The officer who killed Smith, also Black, was acquitted in the fatal shooting. Smith’s death touched off days of rioting in which businesses were burned, including a gas station, an auto parts store and a beauty supply shop. Firefighters were held back from the gas station blaze because of gunfire. The two plaintiffs, in their 2019 lawsuit, said their rights to the freedoms to assemble and to express themselves were violated when police in riot gear cleared Smith’s memorial site and arrested each of them at separate locations in the neighborhood.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The rush to build wind farms to combat climate change is colliding with preservation of one of the West’s most spectacular predators – the golden eagle – as the species teeters on the edge of decline. Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming, a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate, scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best. Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat to the species: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century, according to a National Audubon Society analysis. That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable – to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world. “We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming, but it doesn’t mean the population is not at risk,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, Wyoming. “As we increase wind development across the U.S., that risk is increasing.” Turbines blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles, which are routinely shot, poisoned by lead, hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}]}
