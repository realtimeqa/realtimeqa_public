We have God, and the hope help will come.”\n\nNow packing sustained winds of 130 mph, the center of Fiona is due to pass just west of Bermuda early Friday, with conditions starting to deteriorate Thursday, said CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford. The island nation is under a hurricane warning; Americans are warned not to travel there, and relatives of US government personnel may leave, the State Department said.\n\n“The National Hurricane Center is certain that Bermuda will experience tropical-storm-force winds,” Shackelford said. “Once Fiona passes by Bermuda, the storm is forecast to impact Nova Scotia by Saturday afternoon.”\n\nIn the Canadian province, residents should prepare for tropical storm-like or even hurricane-like conditions starting as early as Friday evening by securing outdoor items, trimming trees, charging cell phones and creating an emergency kit, said Jason Mew, director of the emergency management office. Shelters will be open for those experiencing homelessness and anyone else in need, he said.\n\nThe Canadian Hurricane Centre has issued a hurricane watch for Nova Scotia from Hubbards to Brule, Prince Edward Island, Isle-de-la-Madeleine, and the coast of Newfoundland from Parson’s Pond to Port aux Basques.\n\nHurricane Fiona “could be Canada’s version of Sandy,” Canadian forecasters warned, comparing the size and intensity as well as the combination of a hurricane and a more winter-like storm such as a nor’easter.\n\nA tropical storm watch has also been issued for several coastlines in Atlantic Canada, including from west of Brule to Cap Madeleine, Quebec, and Anticosti Island.\n\nResidents in Atlantic Canada need to be prepared for a long period of utility outages and structural damage to buildings, according to Environment Canada, Canada’s national weather service.\n\n“Fiona will be historic for Atlantic Canada,” said Brian Tang, atmospheric science professor at the University of Albany.\n\nMeanwhile, a developing storm poised to be named Hermine could become a monstrous threat to the US Gulf Coast by next week, forecast models showed.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, where Fiona delivered flooding rains and an islandwide blackout as it made landfall Sunday, more than 450,000 people lacked or had intermittent water service, according to the government’s emergency portal system.\n\nAs of Thursday, 495,000 customers, about 38%, have electricity in Puerto Rico, according to LUMA Energy, which operates the island’s power grid.\n\nAbout 890,000 customers, or 67% of all users, now have running water, according to Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority Executive President Doriel Pagán Crespo.\n\nA man collects spring water Wednesday at a mountain next to a highway in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona in Cayey, Puerto Rico RICARDO ARDUENGO/X03743/REUTERS\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, where Fiona moved onto land early Monday, 725,246 customers remain without running water and more than 210,000 homes and businesses were dark Wednesday, said Maj. Gen. Juan Méndez García, director of the country’s emergency operations center.\n\nMore than 2,260 homes were destroyed, and some communities were cut off from aid, he said.\n\nElectricity problems dog Puerto Rico\n\nAs Fiona hit the Dominican Republic in the middle of the night, Iverice Viera rushed in waist-deep floodwater to wake up her neighbors in Higüey, she said.\n\nShe’s now trying to dry out her belongings.\n\n“The rooms are empty. I had to throw away a lot. There’s no electricity or water to wash anything,” Viera told CNN en Español.\n\nPuerto Rico, in the meantime, was making some progress on the relief front.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration Wednesday for the US territory, FEMA said. The move allows residents to access grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses.\n\n“This ensures that our people will have access to additional help from FEMA to recover from the damage caused by this event,” Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said in a tweet.\n\nBut crews have faced setbacks in restoring power. Equipment problems have temporarily knocked lines believed to have been repaired back offline, Josué Colón, executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, said Wednesday.\n\nFiona hit almost exactly five years after Hurricane Maria plunged the island into an extended blackout.\n\nAcross the island, more than 800 people were housed in dozens of shelters Wednesday, according to Puerto Rico’s housing secretary, William Rodriguez.\n\nNew York City’s mayor has deployed staff from city agencies to Puerto Rico to help officials surveying damage.\n\n“The team will include representatives from New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM), New York City Department of Buildings, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and the New York City Department of Design and Construction,” according to a news release from the mayor’s office.\n\nCars drive Wednesday under a downed power pole in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico. Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced Thursday his authorization of aid and recovery efforts for Puerto Rico, including the deployment of 74 New Jersey State Troopers and a civilian medical doctor.\n\nFiona also menaced parts of the Turks and Caicos on Tuesday, and many areas of the British territory were still without power Wednesday, namely on Grand Turk, South Caicos, Salt Cay, North Caicos and Middle Caicos, said Anya Williams, acting governor of the islands.\n\nOfficials there were relieved no one was killed in the storm, they said as they began visiting islands and making repairs.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Alaa Elassar", "Aya Elamroussi", "Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}]}

{"question_id": "20220923_2", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/politics/biden-pandemic-60-minutes/", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he believes the Covid-19 pandemic is “over” in an appearance on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” but acknowledged the US still has a “problem” with the virus that has killed more than 1 million Americans.\n\n“The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with Covid. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. It’s – but the pandemic is over,” Biden said.\n\nThe US government still designates Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization says it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the President’s comments follow other hopeful comments from global health leaders.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing last week that the end of the Covid-19 pandemic was “in sight,” and that the world has never been in a better position to end the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Last week, the number of weekly reported deaths from Covid-19 was the lowest since March 2020,” Ghebreyesus said. “We have never been in a better position to end the pandemic. We’re not there yet, but the end is in sight.”\n\nLast month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its Covid-19 guidance to urge the nation away from measures such as quarantines and social distancing and instead focus on reducing severe disease from Covid-19. But the agency says some people, including those who are older, immunocompromised, have certain disabilities or underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for serious illness, and may need to take more precautions.\n\nThere were about 65,000 new Covid-19 cases reported each day over the past two weeks, data from Johns Hopkins University shows, and reported cases are dropping in almost every state. Across the United States, about 400 people are dying every day from Covid-19. Although official case counts are far from representative of true levels of transmission, forecasts published by the CDC say that new hospitalizations and deaths will hold steady for the next month.\n\nFor people hospitalized for Covid-19, the risk of dying fell to the lowest it’s ever been during the Omicron wave, according to a study published last week by the CDC. The researchers suggest that there were several contributing factors to the improved mortality risk: high levels of immunity, both from vaccination and previous infection, advances in treatments and properties of the Omicron subvariants that made them less likely to cause disease.\n\nBiden on 2024\n\nThe President told “60 Minutes” in the interview aired Sunday he had not made a “firm decision” on whether he would run for reelection in 2024 but said he intended to run.\n\n“Look, my intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again. But it’s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen,” Biden said.\n\nThe President said: “I’m a great respecter of fate. And so, what I’m doing is I’m doing my job. I’m gonna do that job. And within the time frame that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.”\n\nThe President and top administration officials have maintained the President intends to run again in 2024, but Biden told ABC in December that it would depend on whether he was in good health.\n\n‘I don’t want to get myself in the middle’\n\nBiden told CBS he had not been briefed on the contents of the documents that were removed from former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence by the FBI in August, and said he did not want to interfere with any potential actions by the Department of Justice.\n\n“I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don’t want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I – I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not,” Biden said.\n\nThe Justice Department removed 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago while executing a search warrant for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other crimes, according to unsealed court documents.\n\nAsked what his reaction was when he saw the photograph taken by the FBI that showed an array of documents found on Trump’s property, Biden said: “How that could possibly happen? How one – anyone could be that irresponsible?”\n\n“And I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or, et cetera. And it just, totally irresponsible,” Biden said.\n\nBiden said no one has briefed him on whether important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former President’s residence.\n\n“I have not personally spoken to anyone on that – in that regard. I’m sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also told CBS that US military personnel would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. The President was asked whether “US forces, US men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion,” a prospect US officials privately fear is becoming more likely.\n\n“Yes,” Biden responded.\n\nIt’s not the first time Biden has gone beyond the US approach of “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to Taiwan. During a visit to Tokyo in May, Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force.\n\nThe White House has consistently said after Biden’s comments that US policy hadn’t changed, and “60 Minutes” reported receiving a similar response to Biden’s answers in their interview.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. Biden repeated his commitment to those policies in the “60 Minutes” interview.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Jamie Gumbrecht Allie Malloy Kevin Liptak", "Kate Sullivan", "Jamie Gumbrecht", "Allie Malloy", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}]}

The counter-attacks galvanized Ukraine’s Western backers and caused anger in Russia, which has time and again been stymied in its full-scale assault of its neighboring state that it launched seven months ago.\n\nRussian police officers detain a person during an unsanctioned rally, after opposition activists called for street protests against the mobilisation of reservists ordered by President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, Russia September 21, 2022. Reuters\n\n“Our country also has various means of destruction and in some components more modern than those of the NATO countries, and if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,” Putin said in his speech Wednesday indicating a possible new chapter in the months-long conflict.\n\nAddressing the potential for escalation and use of nuclear weapons, Putin said: “Those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the prevailing winds can turn in their direction.”\n\nThe announcement comes as Russia is believed to face shortages of manpower and follows amendments to Russia’s law on military service made Tuesday, which raise the penalties for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order during a period of mobilization or martial law.\n\nPutin framed the ongoing fighting as part of a larger struggle for Russian survival against a West whose goal is it is to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country.” Several Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine announced that they will hold referendums on formally joining Russia this week, votes that have widely been dismissed as shams intended to boost Putin’s justifications for further attacks on Ukrainian territory.\n\n“They are already saying directly that they were able to split the Soviet Union in 1991 and now the time has come for Russia to break up into a multitude of regions and areas which are fatally hostile to each other,” Putin said.\n\nBut NATO leaders dismissed the announcement as a sign of panic in the Kremlin, and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Ukraine’s military.\n\nPolice officers detain a person in Moscow on September 21, 2022, following calls to protest against partial mobilisation announced by President Vladimir Putin. - President Vladimir Putin called up Russian military reservists on September 21, saying his promise to use all military means in Ukraine was \"no bluff,\" and hinting that Moscow was prepared to use nuclear weapons. His mobilisation call comes as Moscow-held regions of Ukraine prepare to hold annexation referendums this week, dramatically upping the stakes in the seven-month conflict by allowing Moscow to accuse Ukraine of attacking Russian territory. ALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden condemned the mobilization and the Kremlin’s planned votes, during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\n“Just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats towards Europe … now Russia is calling up more soldiers to join the fight, and the Kremlin is organizing sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine,” Biden said. “The world should see these outrageous acts for what they are.\n\n“Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened, but no one threatened Russia – and no one other than Russia sought conflict,” Biden added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz meanwhile called the mobilization an “act of despair.”\n\n“Russia cannot win this war. But this is a kind of panic reaction,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added Wednesday.\n\nA destroyed Russian tank in Izium, a town recently liberated by Ukrainian Armed Forces. Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\nReferendums announced\n\nThe referendums, which Putin backed during his speech Wednesday, could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.\n\nIn what appeared to be a coordinated announcement, Russian-appointed leaders in the occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic all said they planned to hold “votes” beginning on September 23.\n\nTogether the four regions that have announced their referendum plans make up around 18% of Ukraine’s territory. Russia does not control any of the four in their entirety.\n\nThe expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.\n\nUkraine has dismissed the announcement of referendums in the occupied regions as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat,” while the the country’s Western supporters signaled they would not alter their support for Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure. The United States will never recognize Russia’s claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nPutin on Wednesday said Russia has been asked for support from the two “people’s republics” and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia for the referendums and had pledged to do “everything to ensure the safe conditions for people to express their will.”\n\nPotential for escalation\n\nThe announcements had already received swift support from Russian politicians. Former Russian President and vice-chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has publicly endorsed referendums in the self-declared Donbas republics, saying this would have “huge significance” for “systemic protection” of the residents.\n\n“Encroachment on Russian territory is a crime which allows you to use all the forces of self-defense,” Medvedev said on his Telegram channel, in an apparent allusion to the potential for the military escalation.\n\nBut social media video geolocated by CNN showed protests in several Russian cities on Wednesday, each involving what appear to have been a few dozen people. The independent monitoring group OVD-Info said that more than 100 people had been detained at anti-mobilization demonstrations in total.\n\nIt’s unclear what form an escalation could take, but concerns have been raised throughout the conflict over whether Russia would resort to using its nuclear stockpile in the Ukraine.\n\nA billboard promoting contract army service, with the slogan \"Serving Russia is a real job,\" in St. Petersburg. Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden addressed these concerns in a 60 Minutes interview earlier this week, when a reporter asked what he would say to the Russian leader regarding the use of chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n“Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,” Biden said, adding that the US response to such actions would be “consequential.”\n\nPutin endorsed a new “deterrent” strategy in June 2020 that allowed for the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack on Russia that threatened its existence.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, amended the law on military service, toughening the punishment for violation of military service duties – such as desertion and evasion from service – according to state news agency TASS.\n\nThe bill sets a jail term of up to 15 years for resistance related to military service or coercion to violate an official military order, involving violence or the threat of its use, during the period of mobilization or martial law.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Rob Picheta", "Simone Mccarthy", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}]}

They range from local Facebook or online groups to more established conservative organizations.\n\n“While we think of book bans as the work of individual concerned citizens, our report demonstrates that today’s wave of bans represents a coordinated campaign to banish books being waged by sophisticated, ideological and well-resourced advocacy organizations,” said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive officer of PEN America.\n\nOne of those groups is Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that came together last year to fight for parental rights in Florida and has since spread across the country. PEN America has identified another seven national groups with numerous chapters, as well as 38 groups operating at the state, regional, or community level that appear unaffiliated with the national groups or with one another, the report says.\n\n“Some of the groups espouse Christian nationalist political views, while many have mission statements oriented toward reforming public schools, in some cases to offer more religious education,” according to the report.\n\nFriedman said some of the groups stem from the “anger fomented against schools during the pandemic” as some people shared their frustration over school closures, mask mandates, or vaccines. Other groups “have been around for a long time and have now moved into putting pressure on schools in new ways or with new success,” he said.\n\nMembers of Moms for Liberty have taken to podiums at school board meetings and rallies to protest mask and vaccine mandates, materials in books and curricula related to race and LGBTQ rights, and critical race theory (CRT), among other issues.\n\nPEN America said the actions of these groups can be “linked directly” to at least 20% of the book bans enacted in the 2021-2022 school year. Those actions included members making statements at a school board meetings, submitting list of books for formal reconsideration, or filing paperwork to challenge books with school districts.\n\nWhile people in America have the right to organize and advocate under the First Amendment, PEN America says it’s concerned with how those tactics are being used with “the end goal of restricting or banning books” and how often schools are giving into the groups’ demands without objection.\n\n“Parents and community members play an important role in shaping what students learn in school but this goes far beyond organic expressions of concern or the normal give-and-take between parents and educators in a healthy school environment,” Nossel said. “These groups have made it their mission to undermine educators, sabotage students’ freedom to read and stoke divisive battles that distract from teaching and learning.”\n\nPoliticians want to ban more books. Austin’s library system is celebrating them instead\n\nAs part of its report, PEN America released an updated number of book bans. From July 2021 to June 2022, the group says, there were 2,532 book bans directed at 1,648 different titles.\n\nAbout 41% of those were books that tell stories related to LGBTQ people or that have a queer lead or prominent secondary character, the report says. Another 40% of the titles have main characters who are people of color, while 21% of titles directly address issues of race and racism, the report said.\n\nThe findings are similar to those released last week by the American Library Association, which said efforts to censor books in the US are on track to surpass last year’s count.\n\nThe ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom has tracked 681 attempts to ban or restrict “library resources” in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries nationwide between January 1 and August 31.\n\nBook banning efforts are inspiring readers to form banned book clubs\n\nThe group tracked 729 book challenges in 2021 based on direct reports to the ALA, news coverage and public records. The ALA has said it was the highest number of attempted book bans since the organization began compiling its list of the most challenged books.\n\nThe organization has been collecting data about banned books since 1990, but it has published a list of the most-challenged books since at least 2001.\n\n“The unprecedented number of challenges we’re seeing already this year reflects coordinated, national efforts to silence marginalized or historically underrepresented voices and deprive all of us – young people, in particular – of the chance to explore a world beyond the confines of personal experience,” said ALA President Lessa Kananiʻopua Pelayo-Lozada.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}]}
