The agency, partnered with the University of Georgia and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), said the finding marked the first detection of the non-native species in \"the open United States.\"\n\nLast month Clemson University’s Plant Industry Department captured a yellow-legged hornet queen in Jasper County and eliminated it's nest the Bluffton Today, part of the USA TODAY Network reported.\n\nIn addition to threatening domestic and feral honey bees, according to the USDA, the hornets threaten crops.\n\nIt was not immediately known how the invasive insects made their way the U.S. soil, but University of Georgia (UGA) scientists found evidence suggesting they originated in Asia.\n\nThe 2024 cicada invasion:How to save your trees and shrubs from damage\n\nGeorgia stepping up efforts to track, kill yellow-legged hornets\n\nThis week, Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said the agency, in coordination with federal and state partners, is \"significantly stepping up\" efforts to eradicate\" the yellow-legged hornet from Georgia.\n\nThe department, according to land management officials, is increasing the number of traps in the Savannah area 170 in 2023 to more than 1,000 traps this year.\n\nHarper also said the department is hiring additional staff and plans to use \"new, cutting-edge technology\" to eradicate the insects.\n\nCrews plan to use new trackers to track the invasive species back to their nests using trackers lighter (.15 grams) than previous trackers used last year (.31 grams), the department said, adding the heavier trackers impacted the hornets ability to fly and impacted the agency's ability to track the hornets.\n\nThe trackers are equipped with wing sensors calibrated to recognize the unique frequency wingbeat of yellow-legged hornets in an effort to alert teams on the ground when they detect the insect's activity.\n\n\"This invasive pest is a threat to native pollinators and our state’s number one industry, agriculture, and we continue to ask for the public’s help as we do everything in our power to achieve complete eradication,\" Harper said.\n\nWhat does a yellow-legged hornet look like?\n\nThe yellow-legged hornet is wasp species can grow up to an inch long, according to the nation's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).\n\nTheir nests, which are large and contain up to 6,000 workers, are made above ground from \"paper-like material\" and in addition to trees, can be found on garages, barns and sheds.\n\nWhen do yellow-legged hornet queens emerge?\n\nMated queens emerge in the spring to find a food source, establish an embryonic nest, and begin producing workers, land management officials said. Once the colony has grown enough, they will establish a much larger secondary nest in the summertime.\n\n\"In our experience these secondary nests are typically located about 80 to 100 feet high in a tree,\" Agvent said.\n\nAccording to APHIS, the species was first spotted in the U.S. in August 2023 when a beekeeper in Savannah reported an unusual hornet on his property to the Georgia land management officials.\n\nAgency staff and pest management professionals destroyed the nest on Aug. 23 in a residential neighborhood on Wilmington Island.\n\nAfter that nest was eradicated, scientists Lewis Bartlett with UGA and Jamie Ellis with the University of Florida examined it and identified developing hornets within the nest but found no evidence of reproductive males or queens in the colony.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The public can help efforts to suppress these species by reporting sightings through the department's website, he said.\n\nHere are six invasive species to watch for in Kentucky — some well-established and others still gaining a foothold.\n\nSpongy moth\n\nThe spongy moth poses a major threat to Kentucky's forests, with an appetite for hundreds of different tree and shrub species, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Native to Europe, the species first appeared in the U.S. in the 19th century in Massachusetts, and has spread outward since.\n\nOfficials advise looking out for the spongy moth in its caterpillar or adult moth form. Defoliated trees or egg masses — tan clumps found on trees, often on the underside of branches — are also indicators of the species' spread.\n\nKentucky has been able to keep the moth from settling in so far, monitoring for the species and trapping it near the borders, Palli said. Populations have already been established in five Kentucky-adjacent states, from Illinois to Virginia, and the USDA's Slow the Spread program is treating areas to suppress them.\n\nImported fire ant\n\nFor years, fire ants have been a threat to the western side of the commonwealth. But last year, they were detected in sizable numbers in the east, spreading north from Tennessee into McCreary, Whitley, Knox and Bell counties, surveys show.\n\nA changing climate could also encourage the northward expansion of pests like the fire ant, although data on the topic is still lacking, Palli said. Insects tend to thrive in warmer climates, meaning states like Kentucky could appeal to invasive species that have historically remained further south.\n\nThese pests eat crops, and their venom can pose a risk to humans and animals. The state entomologist's office advises not approaching a suspected mound, and instead contacting the local university extension or submitting a report to ReportAPest@uky.edu.\n\nMore:Here are 3 tips to try to get rid of invasive plants in your garden\n\nAsian longhorned tick\n\nThe Asian longhorned tick \"should be taken as a serious threat to both animal and human health,\" according to Healthy Farms Healthy Agriculture, \"and can collect in massive groups on a single host, causing significant distress and blood loss.\"\n\nIt can also act as a vector for bovine theileriosis, threatening the state's cattle populations, and has already been found causing issues on a few dairy farms, Palli said.\n\nThe species first made an appearance in Kentucky a few years ago, and since then has spread to Boone, Floyd, Madison, Martin, and Metcalfe counties. The tick's presence is expected to grow further this year.\n\nFor subscribers:This flower exists in only a tiny part of Kentucky. Can it be saved from Louisville sprawl?\n\nSpotted lanternfly\n\nThe colorful spotted lanternfly, deemed a \"cockroach with a makeover\" by Jimmy Kimmel, has not yet established itself in Kentucky.\n\nBut four states bordering the commonwealth have reported sightings, including in two counties bordering Northern Kentucky.\n\n\"It's a matter of time, I think,\" Palli said. \"We'll have it here.\"\n\nShould the insect gain a foothold in Kentucky, damage would likely be extensive to fruit orchards and vineyards, as well as the state's forests.\n\n\"These come in huge numbers,\" Palli said. \"They'll eat almost everything in their way.\"\n\nIn Kentucky, not yet a quarantine area for the pest, the USDA advises: \"IF YOU SEE ONE, SMASH IT,\" but only after taking a picture to document the finding and report it to officials.\n\nAsian longhorned beetle\n\nThis invasive beetle species is especially devastating to hardwood trees, including ash, birch, elm, maple and others, and threatens billions of dollars worth of natural resources, according to USDA estimates.\n\nIt hasn't yet been identified in the commonwealth, but over the last decade has made appearances near Northern Kentucky, including areas just east of Cincinnati.\n\nThe pest, usually about an inch long with striped, curling antennae, kills trees by boring into them. Look out for their \"pencil-sized, perfectly round tree exit holes,\" per the USDA.\n\n\"If Asian longhorned beetle comes to your neighborhood,\" Palli said, \"they'll destroy the trees in your yard.\"\n\nFor subscribers:Where to find 40 of Kentucky's most impressive trees, and why they matter\n\nEmerald ash borer\n\nSince its discovery in Michigan two decades ago, the invasive emerald ash borer has killed millions of ash trees, including in Kentucky, where it has built up a significant presence. Only a handful of counties in the commonwealth are free of the pest.\n\nAfter this brightly colored beetle species has infested an ash tree, the tree may live for only about one to three more years, according to the University of Kentucky's Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey. Within a year, its crown will thin drastically, and more of the canopy will follow.\n\nOne way to prevent emerald ash borer spread is to use buy and burn firewood locally. Transporting firewood can allow pests like the emerald ash borer or the Asian longhorned beetle to hitch a ride, widening their spread.\n\nConnor Giffin is an environmental reporter for The Courier Journal and a corps member with Report for America, a national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on under-covered issues.

Hugh F. Culverhouse Jr., a 70-year-old Florida real estate investor, said he has no doubt the board of trustees acted in response to his remarks, and he bitterly complained that the state of Alabama is only reinforcing its reputation as “the land of the backward,” full of “hicks.” University officials emphatically denied the decision had anything to do with Culverhouse’s stand on the abortion law and said it was prompted instead by his attempts to dictate how the money should be spent. They did not elaborate. Within minutes of the trustees’ vote, a maintenance crew had removed his name from the building.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: Wildlife authorities are warning residents in the state’s interior to beware of hares. Alaska Department of Fish and Game veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen says tularemia is showing up in hares. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports tularemia can be transmitted to dogs and cats that mouth or catch sick hares. The disease is spread by bacteria through hare and vole ticks. It’s most often seen in summer, when ticks are most active. Late stages of the disease can make hares slow and easy to catch by pets. People can become infected by handling hares or coming into contact with an infected pet’s saliva. The most common symptoms in people and pets are lethargy, high fever and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be fatal if untreated but cured with antibiotics if diagnosed quickly.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed legislation Friday that would have tripled the amount state lawmakers receive for each day they work. Ducey said such a change shouldn’t apply to current lawmakers but rather should kick in only after the next election. Lawmakers in both parties backed the proposal, saying rural lawmakers especially are undercompensated for their costs of traveling to and staying in Phoenix during the session. They also noted that changes to federal tax law eliminated many write-offs for expenses. Ducey seemed to take a dim view of boosting expense payments for lawmakers who live in the Phoenix area but noted that “Arizona is the sixth largest state in terms of land area” and said that for certain legislators living farther away, “there is a strong case to be made” for adjusting the stipend.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has cleared the way for an 88-year-old bridge to be demolished. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the court’s 6-1 decision dismissed an appeal Thursday to save the White River Bridge in Clarendon. An Arkansas Department of Transportation spokesman says a demolition timeline will be established within four weeks. The bridge and its replacement are in wildlife sanctuaries on the White and Cache rivers overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The department has agreed to restore the site’s natural topography and re-establish native hardwood trees. Supporters of the bridge have been rallying to preserve and adapt it for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Three architect-led teams will compete for the job of leading master planning for renovation of the city’s famed La Brea Tar Pits. Officials of the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County announced the beginning of the long-term initiative Thursday. The Tar Pits are an active Ice Age excavation site that has yielded millions of fossils including saber-toothed cat, dire wolf and mastodon skeletons, as well as samples of plants, small animals and insects that give researchers insight into 50,000 years of history. In addition to being an active paleontological research facility, the Tar Pits receive more than 400,000 visitors each year. The teams competing to reimagine the 12-acre campus are Dorte Mandrup of Copenhagen, Weiss/Manfredi of New York and Diller Scofidio + Renfro of New York.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Fort Carson officials say they are working to improve housing at the military installation after a report documented poor maintenance and squalid conditions. The Gazette reports a survey by the Military Family Advisory Network found problems at more than 160 military locations in the U.S. but recorded the most complaints – 147 – at Fort Carson. According to the survey, 63% of Fort Carson respondents said their units needed better maintenance, repairs or remediation. Fort Carson’s garrison commander, Col. Brian Wortinger, says nearly 11,000 work orders have been submitted since mid-February, with all but 500 completed. He says the company overseeing housing has hired two resident engagement specialists, two quality control supervisors and a specialist to improve communications with residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: A festival was held Saturday to raise money for an animal sanctuary that is being built to honor the memory of a 6-year-old Sandy Hook School shooting victim. The 5th annual Catherine’s Butterfly Party on the Fairfield Hills Campus in Newtown was to include children’s activities, wildlife demonstrations, food trucks, music and pet adoptions. It was hosted by the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary. The 34-acre sanctuary is being built to honor Hubbard, who was among 26 people killed inside the Sandy Hook School in December 2012. It is being designed to provide rescue and support services for companion animals, farm animal refuge, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, and educational programming.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Separation Day commemorates the state’s independence from Great Britain and Pennsylvania, but over the weekend it also brought the community of New Castle together with visitors and local nonprofits. “Is a very important patriotic event for Delaware. It is almost like the Independence Day,” said Cindy Snyder, site manager of the New Castle Courthouse Museum. The 244th anniversary of Delaware’s independence drew thousands to Old New Castle on Friday and Saturday, with a barbecue contest, children’s activities, a parade, fireworks and more. Snyder said the event was slated to see almost 10,000 attendants throughout the two days of celebration, especially during the Saturday concert and fireworks.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Tourists may find it harder to get that perfect snap of the White House after construction begins on a new 13-foot fence, almost double its current height, to help keep intruders out. The Secret Service says a $64 million construction project will begin soon on what eventually will be a 13-foot, 1-inch fence with wider and stronger pickets. The existing fence stands about 6 feet, 6 inches tall. The agency, which protects the president, declined to discuss details of the state-of-the-art features it says will be part of the new barrier. The National Park Service, which provides care and upkeep for the White House and its 18 acres of grounds, has also been involved in the project. Active construction, once it begins in the summer, is expected to continue into 2021, the Secret Service said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Friday that creates more hurdles for citizens to change the state Constitution through petition drives. The bill requires paid petition gatherers to register with the secretary of state, outlaws paying gatherers based on the number of signatures they collect and creates fines if petitions aren’t turned in within 30 days. The petitions also must include the name and permanent address of the gatherer. Democrats said that will discourage people from collecting petitions in an already difficult amendment process. Republicans said it will help prevent fraud and keep out-of-state interests from meddling with the Constitution. Last year an amendment restored voting rights for most felons once they’ve completed their sentences. In 2016 an amendment legalized medical marijuana.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRome: Classes are optional for hundreds of seniors expected to transfer to the serene campus of Berry College next summer. And once they settle in, they plan to never leave. But cut them some slack: The seniors in question are in their 70s and 80s, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The private liberal arts institution is leasing land on its Rome campus to a nonprofit for a retirement complex now under construction. The college also provided seed funding for the complex. With the opening of The Spires next summer, 350 senior residents will be just a third of a mile from the main part of campus. They’ll be welcome to roam the college’s more than 40 miles of trails, hang out in the student center, attend school football games or concerts, and take classes for free, space permitting.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: State officials say an introduced caterpillar and moth native to Southeast Asia is eating indigenous plants on Maui that provide important habitat for native species. The Maui News reports a biologist looking for native snails in October noticed signs of unfamiliar caterpillars feeding on mamaki leaves. The caterpillar and moth turned out to be the Ramie moth. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources says it then received reports of the bug from across the island. The Ramie moth is laying its eggs on several plants in the nettles family, such as mamaki and akolea. These plants are food sources for the Kamehameha caterpillar and are valued by Native Hawaiians for their fiber and medicinal qualities. It’s the first documented sighting of the caterpillar in the U.S.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S Air Force says a federal lawsuit seeking to halt coordinated urban air- and ground-training exercises over nine cities in southern Idaho should be dismissed. The Air Force says in documents filed Friday in U.S. District Court that it did not abuse its discretion when giving the OK for up to 160 training events per year. The military says air support for ground forces has been increasingly required in urban combat areas. The training in Idaho involves aircraft flying over cities, including the capital, Boise, and communicating with service members dressed as civilians on the ground to identify targets with low-power lasers. The lawsuit filed by area residents contends that the Air Force did not do enough to inform the public and that the training endangers residents’ health, safety and quality of life.\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: A group is recommending that the University of Illinois erect a plaque or monument to commemorate the history of Chief Illiniwek, the mascot who was dropped amid much criticism in 2007. The Chancellor’s Commission on Native Imagery says the site outside Memorial Stadium, as well as a public retirement, could provide “healing and reconciliation.” The group also recommends regular activities involving the university and Native Americans who consider Illinois their ancestral home. A student dressed as Chief Illiniwek performed a traditional dance at sporting events, running the entire 100-yard football field. But many people called the portrayal offensive and would not watch. The university stopped using the chief in 2007.\n\nIndiana\n\nAlbany: The former headquarters of the company that oversees licensing for the lasagna-loving cartoon cat Garfield will be auctioned off this month. PAWS Inc. employees have moved out of the complex in this eastern Indiana town, but the business is still in operation, with workers now working from home. Garfield creator Jim Davis donated PAWS Inc.’s former headquarters to the Ball State University Foundation, which will receive the proceeds from the June 24-26 online auction of two parcels totaling 19 acres. The property includes a nearly 43,000-square-foot main facility, a free-standing studio building, warehouse and maintenance buildings, and a commercial greenhouse. PAWS Inc. was founded by Davis in 1981 to support Garfield’s licensing and handle creative and business concerns.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: The cities of Dubuque, Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa have been awarded federal grants to clean up and redevelop contaminated sites. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced last week that the cities had been selected to receive $1.6 million in brownfield grants. They’re among 149 communities nationwide selected to receive 151 grant awards totaling nearly $65 million. Dubuque will receive $800,000 to revitalize areas across the community, including sites in the South Port, Washington Neighborhood and North End neighborhoods. Fort Dodge is getting $500,000 to clean up the Wahkonsa Annex contaminated with inorganic contaminants, and Oskaloosa will get $300,000 to promote investment in existing neighborhoods, encourage cleanup and reuse contaminated property.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is asking anyone who bought a rhododendron plant at Walmart stores in the state since April to destroy them. The Kansas Department of Agriculture reported Friday that confirmed cases of the sudden oak death disease have been found in rhododendrons sold at 60 Walmarts in Kansas and one Home Depot in Pittsburg. The plant disease has infected trees and native plants in California and Oregon and has also been identified in 10 Midwestern states. It is the first time the disease has been noted in Kansas. The diseased plants sold in Kansas originated from the Park Hill Plants nursery in Oklahoma. The plants must be destroyed because there is no cure for the disease. The plants should be burned or double-bagged and thrown away. The root ball should also be thrown out. The disease poses no risk to humans or animals.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Officials have unveiled new branding for the city’s airport to go along with a renaming to honor Muhammad Ali. Mayor Greg Fischer and Ali’s widow, Lonnie, unveiled a new logo and designs at the airport during a ceremony Thursday. The Airport Authority Board voted in January to change the airport’s name to the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. The logo shows a silhouette of Ali with arms raised against a butterfly. Officials say the butterfly pays homage to Ali’s famous phrase “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and the context of flight for the airport. The unveiling took place as part of the city’s Ali Week, which is held the first week of June to mark the passing of Ali, who died in 2016.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: From a falling facade to broken windows, the historic Arlington Hotel in the city’s downtown has been vacant since 1990. But for the first time in decades, the old building will soon see new life. KTBS-TV reports the Metropolitan Planning Commission has voted to approve a special use permit for the Larsen Family LP to turn the former hotel into a distillery, a French-style restaurant and a speakeasy bar. The man behind the project is Shreveport architect Kevin Bryan. It will be called Every Man a King Distilling. The name stems from famed Louisiana senator and former Gov. Huey Long, nicknamed the Kingfish. While seeking re-election in 1930, Long promised to make every man a king. It was a message voters had never heard before.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state now has an official ballad that commemorates a unit that fought during the Civil War. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on Friday legislation that named the “Ballad of the 20th Maine” as the state’s official ballad. The ballad was performed at the Statehouse by the group known as The Ghost of Paul Revere. NewsCenterMaine reports the ballad tells the story of the 2nd Maine Infantry Regiment through the eyes of Litchfield soldier Andrew Tozier as the unit joined the 20th Maine, which fought valiantly at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War. Mills says the ballad reminds Mainers about important the role state played in the nation’s history. Maine already has a separate state song and state march.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Four top executives of the University of Maryland Medical System’s board have resigned amid the continuing investigation into board financial arrangements that led Baltimore’s previous mayor to resign. The Baltimore Sun reports the resignations announced Thursday include chief administrative officer Jerry Wollman, chief compliance officer Christine Bachrach, chief performance improvement officer Keith Persinger and the system’s primary lawyer, Megan Arthur. The changes are effective June 21. Former Mayor Catherine Pugh was a former board member who left her mayoral post last month amid investigations into whether she sold self-published books to the system to disguise hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. Three other members resigned last month, including former board chairman Stephen Burch.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has signed a bill providing $200 million to cities and towns for local infrastructure projects. The so-called Chapter 90 funds were given final approval by the Democratic-controlled Legislature last week. Baker said in a statement Friday that the state money is critical for cities and towns for highway construction, road paving and other projects. Under the program, communities submit receipts to the state for reimbursements for costs associated with eligible infrastructure projects. The state Department of Transportation verifies the expenses are eligible for reimbursement. The Baker administration says more than $1.1 billion in Chapter 90 funds have been given since the governor took office in 2015.\n\nMichigan\n\nEau Claire: The polar vortex that enveloped much of the Midwest early this year nearly wiped out the peach crop in southwestern Michigan, according to experts. Some of the region’s apricot, plum and apple crops may also be affected after the blast of polar air plummeted temperatures to minus 20 degrees in late January, breaking water pipes and ice-jamming bridges in areas around the state. Bill Shane, a tree fruit specialist at Michigan State University, told the South Bend Tribune that Michigan’s southwestern counties will suffer millions of dollars in losses from damage to fruit crops. The polar vortex also may have shortened the life span of trees that were severely damaged, he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThief River Falls: Rural communities in the state are scrambling to recruit and retain workers as baby boomers reach retirement age. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that electronic component distributor Digi-Key is among the companies testing innovative strategies to attract workers at all stages of their lives. The Thief River Falls business plans to add 1,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. The expansion plans come during a decade when Pennington County’s over-65 population is estimated to rise from about 18% to 27%. Digi-Key pitches higher starting salaries and low-cost health insurance. But the distributor also offers flexible schedules, training, an onsite medical office, and buses from Crookston and Grand Forks, North Dakota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor is asking that the federal government declare a fisheries disaster as water from a Mississippi River spillway gushes into what’s normally a saltwater estuary. The unprecedented second opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway last month also has an increasing number of Mississippi officials demanding a voice in when the spillway is opened. That’s because the freshwater from the river that streams through Louisiana’s Lake Pontchartrain and into the Mississippi Sound is bad for oysters, shrimp, crabs and other saltwater-loving seafood. Gov. Phil Bryant announced Friday that he had made the request, releasing a May 31 letter to U.S Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Bryant says 70% of the Mississippi Sound’s already imperiled oyster population is estimated to be dead, with the crab catch down by 35%.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Voters in the city will decide Nov. 5 whether to keep a historic city boulevard named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The City Council on Thursday approved an initiative petition seeking to change the nearly 10-mile boulevard’s name back to The Paseo, which it has been called since 1899. That comes after the council voted in January to rename the street, ending a long campaign by black pastors and the local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to name a street in the city for King. A grassroots group opposed to the name change quickly formed and gathered more than 2,800 signatures on petitions to put the issue on the ballot – far more than the 1,700 needed. That made Thursday’s council vote a procedural matter.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal, state, local and tribal fire managers say they’re ready for the upcoming fire season, but they stopped short of predicting how many acres might burn. After discussing this winter’s snowpack, runoff, temperature trends and expected weather patterns, meteorologist Colleen Haskell said most of the state has “normal” potential for significant wildfires. Northwestern Montana’s potential is “above average.” Haskell cautioned that wasn’t suggesting how many acres would burn, just conditions that could lead to fires. Sudden drought and thunderstorms are less predictable. Agency heads told Gov. Steve Bullock on Friday their personnel were trained, their equipment was ready, and they were prepared to work together to fight fires. Officials suggested more resources needed to go into preventing catastrophic fires such as conducting prescribed burns, forest management and community preparation.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Visitors to two state historical parks can see a reenactment of the Pony Express this week. The rides will take place Tuesday and Wednesday at Rock Creek Station and Fort Kearny state historical parks. Each year, members of the National Pony Express Association re-create the Pony Express with a commemorative ride over 10 days. Riders carry letters over the original trail. The 1,966-mile, eight-state event is conducted 24 hours a day until the mail is delivered. Riders will hand the letters to a fresh team at Rock Creek Station State Historical Park near Fairbury at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. Another handoff will take place at Fort Kearny State Historical Park at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Free biscuits and gravy will be available for visitors at 5:45 a.m.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new state law allowing the Silver State to test out a limited marijuana banking system is expected to bring some relief to the state’s booming cannabis industry, where dispensaries and other businesses are forced to deal in cash. The measure, signed into law Wednesday by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, would let the state treasurer’s office set up a three-year pilot program for cannabis businesses. State Treasurer Zach Conine, who pushed for the program, said the system would try to remove the large amounts of cash that Nevada’s pot industry must deal with and instead set up an online system where digital currency could be sent and received. Conine likened the system to gift cards or digital wallet apps like Venmo and said the program would not include broader banking services like loans.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Fans of Pollyanna have something to be extra glad about this year – a state law recognizing the eternally optimistic fictional character. Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill last week designating the second Saturday in June “Pollyanna of Littleton New Hampshire Recognition Day.” Eleanor H. Porter, author of the 1913 book “Pollyanna,” lived in Littleton, where a bronze statue of the beloved character welcomes visitors. The town has been hosting “Pollyanna Glad Day” in June for years. Saturday’s event featured a pancake breakfast, a celebration near the sculpture, a sing-along and a walking tour. The event’s motto is “Be Glad. Be Cheerful. Eat Cake!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSalem: A 600-year-old oak tree known as the tallest in the state has uprooted. The Salem oak came down Thursday evening, drawing people to mourn its loss. The Salem Religious Society of Friends owns the tree and a graveyard that surrounds it. Society member Jim Waddington tells NJ.com the tree has been in declining health over the past 100 years despite efforts to preserve it. The group will meet to decide what to do with the remains. It is believed Quaker John Fenwick, who brought the first English settlement to West Jersey in 1675, brokered a treaty with a Native American tribe under the tree’s branches. The Environmental Protection Department said it was the largest white oak in New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Police are investigating damage to a rainbow-colored crosswalk created in honor of Albuquerque Pride after videos emerged of several motorcyclists trying to deface it. One video posted online shows dozens of bikers riding along Route 66 before a couple of them take turns burning rubber over the crosswalk, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Another biker appears to suffer a blowout from the effort and duckwalks his bike to the curb, its back tire flopping around on the rim. “The facts will determine the appropriate charges, including whether damages amount to misdemeanor or felony charges,” Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said Thursday. The crosswalk was just days old at the time of the episode, having been installed in honor of Pride Week and the city’s LGBT community.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: With Puerto Rican pride on full display along Fifth Avenue, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday that he’s appointing a commission to oversee the construction of a memorial in Manhattan’s Battery Park City to victims of the 2017 storm. This year, for its 62nd iteration, the parade sought to promote the economic development needed for the island to fully get back on its feet. Grand marshal Ricky Martin, the singer known for his stint in Menudo and his hit “Livin’ La Vida Loca,” was celebrated alongside his foundation, dedicated to fighting human trafficking. As New York City marks Pride Month, the parade paid posthumous tribute to Sylvia Rivera, an LGBTQ rights activist who took part in the Stonewall rebellion 50 years ago this month. Others honored in the parade were singers La India and Jose Feliciano, golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez and Hall of Fame-bound baseball slugger Edgar Martinez.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: The Coastal Land Trust has completed the purchase of one of its “Top 40” priority conservation projects on the state’s coast. Trust officials said in a news release Friday that the group purchased more than 700 acres along the banks of the Neuse River across from the city of New Bern. The trust then transferred the property to the state for management by the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. They say the area’s significant natural resources made it a priority for the trust to save. The property’s resources include freshwater marsh, cypress-gum swamp, and forests of bottomland hardwoods, loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Funding for the purchase came from state and federal agencies and grants. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The idea for the next Fortnite or Risk could come from a group of game developers meeting at a video game store here. KVRR-TV reports Kyle Weik started the group Fargo Game Makers to help other game designers develop their ideas into products. Members meet once a month at Replay Games. Weik owns startup game studio Beach Interactive in Fargo. He says it can be difficult to follow through on developing a game when you’re doing it alone. He says he’s enjoyed seeing how members have shaped their games since the group started nearly five years ago. Davin Loegering is among the game designers who have brought their ideas to the group. He’s getting close to releasing his first board game, Imagine Majesty. Loegering says it’s helpful to discuss the game and gauge people’s reactions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An arts district that Ohio State University envisions as the new “front door” to its Columbus campus is a step closer to reality. A committee of university trustees late last month approved $147 million for design services and construction for a project estimated to cost $162 million. The Columbus Dispatch reports the district would be located near 15th Avenue and High Street. Plans include a renovated Weigel Hall to house the School of Music, as well as a new building for the Department of Theatre that will house a Moving Image Production program. Renderings shared with the trustees’ Master Planning and Facilities committee showed a new black box theater, a recital hall for the School of Music, a proscenium theater and rehearsal spaces.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Medical marijuana sales are continuing to climb in the state, topping $23 million in May and marking the eighth straight month of growth for the new industry. Figures from the Oklahoma Tax Commission show the state collected more than $1.6 million in May from the 7% excise tax on marijuana. Another $2 million was collected in state and local sales taxes. To date, medical marijuana sales have generated nearly $10.7 million for state coffers. Sales have grown significantly each month since dispensaries began selling cannabis in October. The number of people eligible to obtain the drug also is continuing to skyrocket. The Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority says it has approved nearly 130,000 patient licenses since August.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Wildlife commissioners have approved the state’s long-overdue Wolf Management Plan after years of revisions, contentious meetings, an outside mediator and half the stakeholders abandoning talks. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the plan, meant to govern how wolves are handled in areas of the state where they don’t enjoy federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, was approved Friday by the commission of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The state’s first wolf plan was issued in 2005 before any wolves had come back to the state after decades of extirpation due to hunting and trapping. The plan’s second version came out in 2010. The plan finally approved Friday came after hunters and ranchers squared off with environmentalists and wolf advocates over when, why and by whom wolves can be killed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFort Indiantown Gap: The lieutenant governor is opening the pool in the official residence he doesn’t use to children who typically wouldn’t have access to one. Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman announced Friday the new access to the pool at the State House. The residence is on National Guard property, about 25 miles from Harrisburg. Fetterman’s wife, Gisele, will run a program to teach water safety and coordinate wider use of the 30-by-40-foot pool. Any Pennsylvania group can request to swim there, but it must provide its own transportation and lifeguard. General Services built a ramp for disabled access, patched the pool, built a lifeguard stand and painted safety messages. Two diving boards were removed, and the pool basin was repainted. The site has a small picnic pavilion, changing rooms and bathrooms.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Rhode Islanders have commemorated their ancestors’ role in helping spark the American Revolution. The annual Gaspee Days celebration began Saturday with a road race and a parade marking the 247th anniversary of the burning of a British ship – a daring act of rebellion that happened more than a year before the Boston Tea Party. On Sunday, costumed actors planned to recreate the June 9, 1772, torching of the HMS Gaspee by setting fire to a smaller model of the ship. Historians say the Gaspee’s burning was an important, if relatively little-known, event that helped touch off America’s war for independence from Britain. A local ship captain lured the schooner into shallow waters in Narragansett Bay a few miles south of Providence, where it ran aground.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state is warning beachgoers to beware after a small number of Portuguese man-of-wars have been sighted. News outlets report the state Department of Natural Resources says people should avoid making contact with the highly venomous creatures – even if they’re dead. Experts say a dead man-of-war can create a sting strong enough to require medical attention. Authorities say the sting to humans is excruciatingly painful but rarely deadly. The creatures, which are marine hydrozoans and relatives of jellyfish, have recently been spotted on Sullivan’s Island and in Hilton Head. The DNR says the man-of-wars are pushed ashore by strong winds and have recently washed onto beaches from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An area farmstead is raising animals more accustomed to the cold, high-altitude areas of Tibet and central Asia. The Rapid City Journal reports that Julie and Jim Smoragiewicz are raising 10 yaks at their Pennington County business, Yak Ridge Cabins and Farmstead. Julie Smoragiewicz says the yaks enjoy climbing the Black Hills, where they can cool down in creeks and under trees. The animals may get too hot in other areas of South Dakota. They also turn yak milk into soap and use their hides and fiber for throws and rugs. Smoragiewicz calls yaks sustainable animals because they eat less food and create less waste than cattle. The animals can also give birth on their own. She says yaks have unique personalities, and they’re fun to be around.\n\nTennessee\n\nClarksville: There tends to be lots of laughter in the home of DJ and Shanieke Pryor – after all, DJ is a professional stand-up comedian.But now, thanks to a video that’s gone viral of DJ and their 19-month old son Kingston Jierre chatting up a storm about the season finale of the TV show “Empire,” much of the world is laughing alongside them. The two say they shot the video about a month ago. It shows DJ lounging on the couch watching TV, with his young son sitting beside him, seemingly striking up a conversation about the show. “They need to work on that, right?” Pryor starts out by saying. “Yes,” Kingston says decidedly. “Did you understand it, though?” Pryor asks the child. Kingston responds: “No.” They go on to have a full-fledged “talk” filled with hand gestures and gibberish. Finally, DJ tells his son: “That’s exactly what I was thinking! We think a lot alike.”\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Fifty years after desegregation separated classmates at Booker T. Washington Technical High School, the class of 1969 turned its recent reunion into a belated convocation. The Dallas Morning News reports although some alumni had graduated from the all-black trade school, others had begun the process of desegregating the Dallas Independent School District by attending historically white schools closer to their own homes. Dozens of former students of the class of 1969 gathered to share memories in the state-of-the-art auditorium behind what is now Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. The celebration also honored students who would have graduated in 1970 had officials not closed the school that year. Their unofficial commencement ceremony came complete with red-ribboned diplomas and candles to honor friends who had died.\n\nUtah\n\nMagna: A gathering at the Great Salt Lake in hopes of making it into the record books fell way short. Utah park officials invited people to a beach on the lake’s south end Saturday in an attempt to set the world record for the largest number of people floating together, unassisted, in a line at one time. The lake’s high salinity makes it easy to float on the water. According to the Guinness World Records website, Argentina holds the current record after 1,941 people successfully floated together on the surface of Lago Epecuen de Carhue in 2017. Utah State Parks manager Jim Wells said only about 300 people showed up for Saturday’s event, but “everybody had fun, (and) it ended up being a beautiful day.”\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is urging anglers and others not to disturb spawning sea lamprey in the Connecticut River and some of its tributaries. They are not to be confused with a separate population of sea lamprey that are controlled as a nuisance species in Lake Champlain. The department says sea lamprey spawn each spring in the main stem of the Connecticut River and in many tributaries. Officials say adult sea lamprey die shortly after returning to freshwater to spawn. The department says the larval lamprey live in freshwater for a few years burrowed in sandy substrate. At age 5, they move downstream to the ocean, where they feed on fish as parasites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after a recent, deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who announced the date Friday, says the best way to respond to the May 31 mass shooting at a municipal building is with “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.” He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on silencers. Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can’t dictate how it’s conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they’ve said they’ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: What should the city do with its public golf courses and the 528 acres of mostly green space they occupy? That’s a question being asked by the city, which commissioned a study looking at the future of the city’s municipal courses, the Seattle Times reports. Mayor Jenny Durkan insists it’s a question that has not been answered but said, “It would be a breach of our duty to the people of Seattle not to be really looking at what is best use of those golf courses, from everything to continuing as golf courses, to finding a way to use part of them as parks, to use part of them for affordable housing.” No one is suggesting, yet, that Seattle ditch one or more of its courses, but the fact that it’s even a topic of conversation has golfers worriedly making the case for their sport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University robotics team has won a NASA competition for the second time in three years. The college on Friday announced the team’s win in NASA’s Moon to Mars Ice & Prospecting Challenge. WVU’s Mountaineer Ice Driller Automated System III beat out other machines made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stevens Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech. The contest has the drilling systems extracting water from a test bed of ice, rock and soil. The competition is meant to help inform approaches for space exploration and development.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Flying a gay pride rainbow flag over the state Capitol for the first time Friday drew backlash from conservatives, including a pair of state lawmakers, who said it was divisive, while Democrats hailed it as a sign of inclusivity. The flag flap erupted after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers ordered the raising of the flag to recognize June as “Pride Month.” The move drew a fast rebuke from state Rep. Scott Allen, who tweeted, “Is this any more appropriate than erecting the Christian flag over the Capitol?” Democrats praised the raising of the flag, including state Sen. Tim Carpenter, one of five openly gay state lawmakers. Dozens of people stood outside the Capitol’s east wing Friday afternoon and cheered as the flag was raised on a pole just below the U.S. and Wisconsin flags.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park has recorded its third-busiest visitation during the month of May as the park began opening up for the busy summer tourist season. The National Park Service says the park recorded 434,385 visits last month. The total is 2.8% less than May 2018, which was the busiest May on record. So far in 2019, Yellowstone has counted more than 576,700 visits, which is up 1% from the same five-month period last year. The park in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho typically sees its most visitors during the summer months.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/23/rare-tornado-one-room-schoolhouse-convoy-eviction-news-around-states/50270579/", "title": "Rare tornado, one-room schoolhouse: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nLaFayette: A federal judge will consider an agreement among the U.S. Justice Department, civil rights attorneys and school officials in Chambers County that could end more than 50 years of federal desegregation oversight of the system. A consent decree with school officials in the east Alabama county, located on the Georgia line, the government and attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund includes construction of a new school and more opportunities for Black students in the county of roughly 35,000 people, officials said. The agreement was announced Friday to end a desegregation order that’s been in place since 1970. It followed a previous, interim agreement reached in 1993. “We are pleased to arrive at a consent decree that addresses the many concerns our clients raised as key to ensuring the effectiveness of the desegregation process in Chambers County,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund. “It was particularly important that Black students in the district are afforded equal and high-quality educational opportunities in safe and modern facilities.” Before the end of the next school year, the district must pick a site to build a new, consolidated high school to replace LaFayette High School, which is heavily Black, and Valley High School, which has a large population of white students.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had about 6,700 more jobs last month than a year earlier, but jobs in most sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the state labor department reported Friday. There were about 11,800 fewer jobs in April than in April 2019, the year before the pandemic, the department said. The biggest year-over-year gain was in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had about 3,900 more jobs last month than in April 2021. The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019. But there were 1,700 fewer jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, 1,100 fewer in leisure and hospitality, and 2,700 fewer in oil and gas last month than in April 2019. Karinne Wiebold, an economist with the department, said recently that Alaska began seeing year-over-year growth in total employment in April 2021, a year after the “initial employment shock” from the pandemic hit. She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: The city has preemptively adopted new rules regulating short-term rental properties before it welcomes a bevy of visitors for the 2023 Super Bowl. Ordinances approved by the Glendale City Council on May 10 amend the city’s codes on short-term rentals and nuisance parties. Owners of homes rented out for brief vacations must now provide contact information to the city in case law enforcement needs to reach them for an emergency or disturbance. Glendale’s ordinance additionally prohibits short-term rental properties from being used for operating as a retail enterprise or an adult-oriented business. Because Glendale currently doesn’t have a registry of short-term rental homes, local leaders say it’s difficult to know how much of a nuisance these properties are creating in the community, 12News reports. “It is possible that officers are responding to noise complaints at short-term rentals and just don’t know they are short-term rentals,” Deputy City Manager Rick St. John said during a council meeting. In another ordinance, Glendale’s police officers have the ability to assess fees to individuals hosting “nuisance parties,” or any social gathering that “constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The barrage of television ads and mailers leading up to Tuesday’s primary election makes the most influential Republicans in the state clear. Tom Cotton’s making the case for fellow U.S. Sen. John Boozman, talking up his conservative bona fides while the two-term senator fends off challenges from the right. Donald Trump’s image appears in ads for Boozman and for Sarah Sanders, who served as the ex-president’s White House press secretary and is now running for governor. Sanders, whose endorsement is almost as sought after as Trump’s, is helping make the closing argument for Boozman in a TV ad. But conspicuously missing from the ads and the campaign trail is the state’s top elected Republican, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is entering the final stretch of his term with strong approval ratings and a raised national profile. Hutchinson’s advisers say he’s concentrating on helping more Republicans nationally as he looks to the future – which might include a White House bid. Sanders has avoided publicly criticizing Hutchinson, even when her former boss labeled the outgoing governor a “RINO” – Republican in Name Only – for his decision to veto an anti-transgender law. Sanders said she would have signed the measure, which bans gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: New rules about how and when actors can use guns while filming failed to pass the Legislature on Thursday, just months after a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding went off and killed a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico. Democrats in California had filed two bills in response to the tragedy, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. With competing proposals, Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the author of one of the proposals, said he “strongly urged” entertainment industry groups to “work collaboratively to bring forward a consensus approach.” But no one did. On Thursday, Portantino decided to hold both bills in committee, meaning they are unlikely to pass the Legislature this year. “It’s a powerful and ruthless industry. First the industry killed Halyna. Then they killed the bill that would’ve made people like her safe,” said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat who authored the other proposal. Cortese’s bill would have banned the use of guns and blank ammunition containing gunpowder or other explosive charges from film sets, with some exceptions. Portantino’s bill would have allowed guns with blank ammunition on set, but only under the supervision of an armorer who has completed a state gun safety course.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A late spring snowstorm dumped several inches in the Denver metro area Saturday and knocked out electricity for about 210,000 customers, officials said. The wet snow weighed down tree branches and sent them toppling onto power lines, the television station KUSA reports. Much more snow fell in mountainous regions of Colorado. By Saturday night, power had been restored to 160,000 customers, but about 50,000 still did not have it back, the Xcel Energy Colorado utility said in a statement. The small Colorado community of Cripple Creek near the base of Pike’s Peak got 20 inches of snow, KUSA reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Eligible families can begin applying next month for the new one-year child tax rebate program that’s included in the newly revised state budget, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. Rebates of up to $250 per child are expected to be issued in late August. The rebates will be provided for up to three children per family. While any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child under the age of 18 on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible for the rebate, the amounts are dictated by income. To receive the maximum amount, the income threshold is $100,000 or less for those single or married filing separately; $169,000 or less for those filing as head of household; and $200,000 for those married filing jointly. Those with higher incomes may be eligible to receive a reduced rebate. The Department of Revenue Services will accept applications from June 1 through July 31. Families can apply online on the DRS website and click on the “2022 CT Child Tax Rebate” icon. DRS is reaching out about the program to more than 300,000 households in the state that may meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report by Amtrak’s inspector general found that the train service’s $41 million purchase of an office building in the city has failed to provide savings that were projected. Amtrak estimated it would save close to $50 million by consolidating operations in the building that it purchased in Wilmington in May 2020. But a report filed May 13 by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General found those savings haven’t materialized for a variety of reasons. Dispatching and police communications were supposed to be consolidated in the building, but that has not occurred because Amtrak has not yet been able to determine if the building can accommodate a large generator necessary to provide emergency power. In addition, Amtrak has been unable to move forward with a plan to move more than 400 information-technology workers to Wilmington. The report found that so many workers would refuse the transfer that operations would be unacceptably disrupted. Amtrak now estimates it won’t need as much space in the building as originally thought.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A moment of happiness and celebration at the Lincoln Memorial turned into a headache for workers with the National Park Service, WUSA-TV reports. The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed to the public Saturday morning after celebrating university graduates reportedly left a mess on the steps of the monument, a National Park Service official said. NPS tweeted a photo of the closure Saturday, claiming the graduation celebration left broken bottles, spilled wine and champagne covering the steps of the national monument. “We will reopen as soon as the area has been cleaned and made safe,” NPS said on Twitter. Facilities staff members worked through the morning and were able to clean the mess within a few hours. The Lincoln Memorial reopened about 11:30 a.m. NPS did not say from which school the celebrating graduates hailed, but many online theorize the students could be from Georgetown University. A spokesperson for the school called the incident “concerning and disappointing.” The spokesperson noted that Georgetown was one of many universities having ceremonies over the weekend and said it no university-sponsored events at or around the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: A billionaire developer from Dubai is set to purchase the site of a South Florida condominium that collapsed last June, killing 98 people, for $120 million after no other bids were submitted by the Friday evening deadline for this week’s auction. Michael Fay, of Avison Young, said hundreds of potential buyers had shown interest in the property, but none were ultimately prepared to match the strong initial bid of Hussain Sajwani, of DAMAC Properties. Avison Young is the commercial real estate firm that was appointed to market the land as part of a class-action lawsuit. The auction for the 1.8-acre parcel in Surfside was scheduled for Tuesday. Earlier this month, families of the victims reached a $997 million settlement with local officials, the developers of an adjacent building and others whom they hold responsible for the collapse of the 40-year-old, 12-story beachside building during the early hours of June 24. Most of the Champlain Towers South collapsed suddenly about 1:20 a.m. last June 24 as most of its residents slept. Only three people survived the initial collapse. No other survivors were found despite the around-the-clock efforts of rescuers who dug through a 40-foot pile of rubble for two weeks. Another three dozen people were in the portion of the building that remained standing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWatkinsville: Two Republican front-runners hoping to clinch primary majorities made their final pitches to voters Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s election. Gov. Brian Kemp and former football star Herschel Walker hope to win GOP nominations for governor and U.S. senator Tuesday without runoffs, with polls showing both men backed by more than 50% of voters. Kemp met voters at a rally in Watkinsville, near his home in Athens, with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts showing up to support him. Walker spoke to Republicans in Columbus, having moved into a more public campaign phase in recent days despite continued questions about his past. Walker has been accused of threatening his ex-wife’s life, exaggerating his business record and lying about graduating from the University of Georgia. An Associated Press story Saturday found that Walker was actually a paid spokesman for a for-profit veterans program that Walker has described as a way he helps veterans. Walker’s speech focused on his life story and general attacks on Democratic policies. “It is time that we get back to where we started,” Walker said, arguing that Democrats have strayed from American values. Other candidates making final pitches include former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, Kemp’s top rival for the Republican nomination, and state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and Navy veteran and former banker Latham Saddler, Walker’s rivals for the Senate seat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Board of Education has selected the former principal of Waipahu High School to be the next superintendent of the state’s public schools. The board voted 8-1 Thursday to select Keith Hayashi, who has been interim superintendent since August. At Waipahu High School, Hayashi pioneered the Early College program, which allows high school students to take college classes through a partnership with the University of Hawaii. College professors teach the classes on high school campuses for which students receive both high school and college credit. The program is now available at 36 high schools across the state. The board’s chairperson, Catherine Payne, said the board was looking for a candidate who could heal the school system, bring the community and stakeholders together, and transition schools out of the pandemic. “His work at Waipahu High School has really touched a lot of students who were struggling and helped them to move forward into successful lives,” Payne said. “So looking at how that might be able to be applied throughout our system is really important.” Hayashi’s appointment will take effect July 1. Payne said his salary and other contract details will be negotiated. The state Legislature has set a maximum salary of $250,000 a year for the job.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate in April dropped a tenth of a percent to 2.6% to mark a third consecutive month of historic lows since record-keeping started in 1976, state officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said 913,000 workers have jobs, while about 24,000 are looking for work, as Idaho’s red-hot economy continues. The state’s labor force of 937,000 in April represents a labor force participation rate of 62.1%, an increase of a tenth of a percent over the previous month. Idaho’s peak participation rate was 71.4% in September 1998. The labor force participation rate is calculated from those 16 years and older working or looking for work. The Labor Department said there are more than two jobs available for every unemployed Idaho resident looking for work. Idaho’s nonfarm jobs exceeded expectations with an increase of 3,000 jobs to 815,500 in April. Industry sectors showing the most gains include natural resources, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and private educational services. Those showing greatest job declines include arts, entertainment and recreation, and information. Idaho’s unemployment rate continues to run below the national unemployment rate, which was 3.6% in April.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An officer who shot and seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy who ran away after being pulled over while driving a stolen vehicle was relieved of his police powers Friday, officials said. “He’s still an active member of the Chicago Police Department,” police spokesman Don Terry told the Chicago Tribune about the officer, whose name hasn’t been released. “He’s not going to be patrolling the streets, and he won’t be able to arrest people.” The action means the officer will still get paid but will be assigned to “desk duty,” Terry said. The officer had already been placed on administrative duties while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates the shooting. Police Superintendent David Brown said Thursday that the fleeing teenager turned toward the officer during Wednesday’s encounter before the officer fired on him. No shots were fired at the officer, Brown said. The boy jumped from the car as officers approached the vehicle, which police said was stolen Monday and used in a carjacking Tuesday. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital, Brown said Thursday. He did not elaborate, and no charges have been announced. No weapon was found at the scene, COPA said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democrats and activists are holding out little hope of getting the votes needed to uphold the governor’s veto of a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in school sports. The Republican-dominated Legislature is slated to override the veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who said in March that the legislation doesn’t provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports.” But the bill passed by wide margins, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate pledged to override Holcomb’s veto with simple majorities. Although two Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted against the measure, Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis said the override will likely be successful when the Legislature reconvenes for one day Tuesday. “This bill was filed, I believe, with the intention to specifically go after transgender Hoosiers because it was a politically savvy thing to do for the Republican base,” Ford said Friday. Still, Ford said Democrats continue to have conversations with lawmakers across the aisle, noting that some Republicans might be inclined to change their votes following the primary and the governor’s veto.\n\nIowa\n\nBettendorf: Students are once again attending class in the 1873 Forest Grove School. After raising about $200,000 over seven years to restore the falling-down, one-room school, supporters have opened the building for free “reenactments” of a typical student day. A schoolmarm teaches subjects and skills as they might have been taught during the 1920s, the time period to which the school was restored. Iowa once had 12,000 to 14,000 one-room school houses, depending on the report consulted, but with either number, Iowa had more than any other state in the nation. Supporters of Forest Grove preservation efforts want Forest Grove to be used to interpret and teach the role these schools played in the state’s history, Sharon Andresen, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, told the Quad-City Times. Because of legislation requiring consolidation of schools, Iowa’s last one-room school closed in 1967; Forest Grove closed 10 years earlier in 1957. Half- or full-day reenactments are open to any public, private or homeschool classes in the Quad City area. Fourth grade is a good target level, but Diane Borcherding, a retired Bettendorf High School biology teacher who is volunteering her time as the schoolmarm, is open to other grades, depending on the circumstances.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Supreme Court on Friday disbarred former prosecutor Jacqie Spradling for her conduct during a double-murder trial in Topeka in 2012. The court said while Spradling was a prosecutor in Shawnee County, she engaged in “repeated patterns of misconduct” during the trial of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of killing her husband and his fiance. Chandler’s convictions were later overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. She is scheduled for a new trial later this year. The Supreme Court said Spradling ignored a court order, made arguments not supported by evidence, lied in her briefs and oral arguments, and made false statements during a disciplinary investigation. The Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys recommended in June 2021 that Spradling be disbarred for her “win at all costs” attitude in the Chandler case and in the 2017 conviction of Jacob Ewing, of Holton, on rape and sodomy charges. The state Supreme Court found Spradling did not violate ethical standards in Ewing’s case. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed Ewing’s conviction in 2018, but he later accepted a plea deal. Last year, Spradling resigned from her position as assistant county attorney in Allen County and as county attorney in Bourbon County.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Katy Perry earned her zookeeper stripes at the Louisville Zoo on Saturday. Zoo staff welcomed the pop music icon with an up-close encounter featuring the zoo’s own superstars, Simon, a black-footed penguin, and Sebastian the sloth. The “Roar” singer has been staying in Kentucky recently with her daughter, Daisy Dove, while fiancé Orlando Bloom shoots his new movie, “Red Right Hand.” Production on that film is expected to wrap up in June. At the zoo, Perry was “Walking on Air” through Wild Lights, a lantern festival featuring 50,000 LED lights. She also posed like a penguin next to Simon and admired the hang-ten skills of Sebastian the sloth, who “truly connected” with Perry, according to a post on the zoo sloths’ Twitter page. The Louisville Zoo features over 1,200 animals in exhibits with themes from all over the world, including Africa, home to Simon and other African penguins, as well as Australia and South America, where the sloths hang out. Earlier this month, Chelsea Handler hosted Perry on her podcast, “Dear Chelsea,” to chat about Perry’s stay in the Bluegrass State. “I’m like, living in Kentucky, and I have for almost a month now. And that’s quite an amazing experience because it reminds you that Hollywood is not America,” Perry said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has agreed to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of shots students are required to get to enroll in school, officials said. The state health department said in a news release Wednesday that it will continue to strongly recommend the vaccine, in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, but acknowledged that the vaccine had not yet received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for those under age 16. “While we strongly recommend all eligible children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now, if they have not already been so, we are making this decision to give families and schools the time they need to prepare accordingly,” the news release said. Because the vaccine is not fully approved for those age 15 and under, requiring it would have made little difference to most students in kindergarten through high school, Edwards noted during his monthly call-in radio show. State Sen. Fred Mills, R-New Iberia, announced on the Senate floor that the administration agreed to remove the requirement after meeting with legislators. Legislation that would have removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the requirement list had stalled earlier in the session.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A teacher whose LGBTQ lesson plan for kindergartners was removed from a state website said Friday that the governor and education department succumbed to outside pressure. The governor and department “caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people, families, and students in Maine,” Kailina Mills wrote in a social media post. The lesson plan was at the heart of a Republican attack ad that accused Democratic Gov. Janet Mills of spending $2.8 million to create “radical school lessons” aimed at kindergartners. On the video, the teacher discusses “Freedom Holidays” like the Fourth of July, Juneteenth and Women’s Equality Day before discussing freedoms won by the LGBTQ community, including same-sex marriage. She talks about sexual identities under the umbrella of “LGBT+” in the discussion. The governor previously said she agreed with the Department of Education’s review that concluded the lesson wasn’t age-appropriate. Kailina Mills disagreed with that assessment, citing a study that showed gender identities are solidified between ages 5 and 7. She wrote Friday that she’s taught preschoolers who are transgender and nonbinary and said that “those children and those families deserve to be represented in their school curriculum.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A western Maryland race track has evicted the remnants of a trucker protest that had used the site as a staging ground. The People’s Convoy had conducted a series of rolling protests around the Capital Beltway in March to protest pandemic restrictions and other grievances. After a hiatus, a smaller group of truckers returned Wednesday to the Hagerstown Speedway. But Speedway General Manager Lisa Plessinger asked the group to leave amid infighting over its next steps. The last of the truckers left Friday night, she said. She compared the convoy to “like when your mother-in-law comes to visit and decides to stay.” A press release issued Friday on a Facebook page for The People’s Convoy “declares victory and announces its conclusion of the national convoy portion of this great movement.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: More than 40 people – including marine mammal experts, interns and volunteers – spent several hours battling an incoming tide to help rescue seven dolphins that got stranded in the shallow waters of a Cape Cod river last week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare first got word that the Atlantic white-sided dolphins got stranded in a shallow gut of the Herring River in Wellfleet on Wednesday morning, and rescuers were on the scene in about an hour, the organization said in a statement. It’s not unusual for dolphins to get stranded in the area because of its shape as a hook within the larger hook of Cape Cod’s shoreline and because of large tidal fluctuations in Cape Cod Bay. “The dolphins appeared alert and in good health, but the day was sure to be sunny and warm, and we needed to move quickly,” said Misty Niemeyer, of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team. The tide was also coming in, and dolphins often risk getting stranded again when it rolls out, she said. The dolphins – all likely young males, 6 to 8 feet in length and weighing up to 250 pounds – were then taken in a vehicle custom-designed to transport dolphins and released in deeper waters off Provincetown in the early afternoon.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Nearly all of the power lost following a deadly tornado that killed two people and flattened parts of a northern Michigan community has been restored, state police said Sunday. Police also said everyone had been accounted for in Gaylord, where Friday afternoon’s EF3 twister also left more than 40 people injured. Authorities had said Saturday that they were not able to account for one person. Cleanup continued Sunday in the town of 4,200 people about 230 miles northwest of Detroit. About 6,100 utility customers in Otsego County, where Gaylord is the county seat, lost power due to Friday’s storms, according to Jackson-based Consumers Energy. State police said Sunday that electricity had been restored to 99% of utility customers in Gaylord. The tornado packed winds of 140 mph that tore roofs and walls from businesses and largely destroyed a mobile home park. Such storms are uncommon in northern Michigan. State police Lt. Derrick Carroll has said the city doesn’t have tornado sirens, though anyone with a mobile phone got a “code red” warning from the weather service about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The Nottingham Forest mobile home park was one of the first places hit by the tornado. Two residents, described by police as being in their 70s, were killed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: A partial skull that was discovered last summer by two kayakers will be returned to Native American officials after investigations determined it was about 8,000 years old. The kayakers found the skull in the drought-depleted Minnesota River about 110 miles west of Minneapolis, Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said. Thinking it might be related to a missing person case or murder, Hable turned the skull over to a medical examiner and eventually to the FBI, where a forensic anthropologist used carbon dating to determine it was likely the skull of a young man who lived between 5500 and 6000 B.C., Hable said. “It was a complete shock to us that that bone was that old,” Hable told Minnesota Public Radio. The anthropologist determined the man had a depression in his skull that was “perhaps suggestive of the cause of death.” After the sheriff posted about the discovery Wednesday, his office was criticized by several Native Americans, who said publishing photos of ancestral remains was offensive to their culture. Hable said his office removed the post. “We didn’t mean for it to be offensive whatsoever,” he said. Hable said the remains will be turned over to Upper Sioux Community tribal officials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Gilbert Mason Jr., who grew up in the civil rights movement and became a physician and a Black and civil rights historian, has died at age 68. Mason died Wednesday and funeral arrangements were not yet complete, according to Infinity Funeral Home in Biloxi. Mason was 5 years old in 1959 when he watched his father, Gilbert Mason Sr., lead Biloxi’s first wade-in to desegregate beaches, the Sun Herald reports. And his name was on the 1971 lawsuit that made Biloxi schools the state’s first to integrate. Like his father, Mason became a physician who served poor people. His practice was in the New Orleans area, but he returned to Biloxi when his father became ill. The elder Mason died in 2006. The son spent his last years documenting civil rights and Black history and his father’s accomplishments, the newspaper reports. Father and son both had photographic memories, said Clemon Jimerson Sr. He said the younger Mason’s memories helped to document the history of scouting on the Mississippi Coast, the music history of Biloxi and other areas for the Mississippi Blues Trail, the integration of Coast schools, and the preservation of Nichols Elementary, the historically Black school in East Biloxi.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: City officials have approved a new ordinance that clarifies when people may witness or record police officers’ actions without being arrested. The Kansas City Council on Thursday approved the ordinance to settle a federal lawsuit filed by three women who were arrested during racial injustice protests in 2020. The women were charged with violating city laws involving resisting or interfering with an officer. The lawsuit said those laws were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, KCUR reports. The ordinance approved Thursday says witnessing or recording police officers does not violate city law unless the offender is substantially impeding the officer’s duties. The women were among more than 200 nonviolent protesters arrested at or near the Country Club Plaza during protests after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The settlement did not require the city to pay any monetary damages.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A full month after a judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to undergo surgery before they could change their gender on their birth certificate, the state still isn’t in compliance with the court order, the ACLU of Montana said. Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the state health department, said the agency is still working with the Department of Justice to review the April 21 ruling and its implications. He did not respond to an email asking if that meant the state was evaluating whether to appeal the order. “We have continued to be patient in allowing the state time to comply with the court ordered preliminary injunction,” the ACLU of Montana said in a recent statement. “However, close to one month has passed and the State’s willful indifference to the court order is inexcusable.” Montana is among a growing list of Republican-controlled states that have moved to restrict transgender rights, including requiring student-athletes to participate in sports based on their gender assigned at birth or making it illegal for transgender minors to be treated with hormones or puberty blockers.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: A pilot died after a single-engine plane crashed at the Wayne Municipal Airport, officials said. The Cessna 140 crashed Friday evening during the MayDay STOL Drag Races. The organization that planned the events said in a Facebook post that the pilot crashed on final approach at the airport after apparently stalling and spinning. No one else was aboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The pilot’s name was not released. STOL, or short take-off and landing, drag racing involves pilots flying side-by-side 2,000 feet down and back up. The rest of the weekend’s planned events were canceled.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 emergency declarations for Nevada ended Friday as the public health agency for metro Las Vegas noted that the pandemic isn’t over and said it will continue to monitor spread of the coronavirus and provide assistance with vaccinating and testing. While most of the state’s pandemic measures, including business restrictions and mask mandates, have already been lifted, the Southern Nevada Health District said it was important to remind the public that the virus that causes COVID-19 continued to circulate. “Cases are currently increasing, and new variants are emerging,” said Dr. Fermin Leguen, chief medical officer for the district. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the state’s emergency Friday – a planned action he announced two weeks ago, saying he wanted to ensure that there would be no gap in services. “Today, we are turning the page on the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19 and are laser focused on ensuring our recovery from the public health, fiscal and economy crisis serves the needs of Nevada’s families,” Sisolak, a Democrat running for reelection, said Thursday in a statement. Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas area, on Thursday announced the end of of its emergency declaration, which was declared March 15, 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConway: A forest fire in northern New Hampshire that’s burned 106 acres is nearly contained, officials said Friday. The Bemis Fire in Crawford Notch State Park, the White Mountain National Forest, and on private land began May 13 in steep, rugged terrain. The cause is under investigation. “It’s important for the public to know that the Bemis Fire remains an active fire scene, and there are still firefighters and equipment on site,” said Capt. Adrian Reyes of the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau. “This weekend is expected to bring record temperatures to the region, and we ask that anyone wishing to spend time outdoors avoids the area of the fire, for their own safety as well as for the safety of the wildland crew,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear population appears to be increasing, based on the number of reported serious encounters with humans, but as New Jersey has had no official bear management plan for the past two years, the Division of Fish and Wildlife doesn’t know for sure. Without the plan, the division did not make an estimate of the bear population in the state’s northwest area last year and won’t do so this year. The last count was done in 2020 and coincided with the last statewide bear hunt. At that time there were about 3,158 bears in northwestern New Jersey, specifically in the areas previously designated as bear hunting zones north of Route 80 and west of Route 287. Records show that reported serious encounters with bears since the count have gone up nearly ninefold. “The DEP does not have a statewide population estimate, though sightings of black bears have been reported in all 21 counties,” said the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Division of Fish and Wildlife. At least two people in Sussex County were injured in separate black bear encounters just outside their homes, and at least three dogs were killed or injured. The 2020 count shows the bear population doubled from the 1,522 counted in 2018, the last year a bear hunt was allowed on state-owned lands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMora: As more than 2,700 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Sunday, many evacuees were growing concerned about their future after weeks away from home. The biggest fire in the state’s recorded history has been burning for six weeks now, and some of the hundreds forced to evacuate say their financial resources are dwindling. Amity Maes, a 30-year-old Mora resident who said she is 81/ 2 months pregnant and penniless, told the Santa Fe New Mexican she bounced around for weeks before finding shelter at an evacuation center in Glorieta, where she believes she contracted COVID-19. Officials at Glorieta Adventure Camps said there have been 67 coronavirus cases among evacuees, including some that required hospitalization. After her isolation period, Maes said she was urged to leave and go to a hotel in Santa Fe where she could be closer to a hospital if she went into labor. But the hotel didn’t have her reservation when she arrived, and when she finally got a room, it was only for one night. “They keep encouraging us to go to Albuquerque” where evacuees are being housed in hotels, Maes told the newspaper. “We don’t have gas. We don’t have no income. There’s no gas vouchers. There’s no anything. I’m on a quarter-tank of gas, and I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street inside the city’s sole Army base now bears the name of a Black Congressional Medal of Honor recipient rather than a Confederate general. Fort Hamilton changed the road’s name to John Warren Avenue on Friday morning, following a years-old push by local officials to remove Confederate symbols nationwide. The base had previously called the street General Lee Avenue, after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lt. John Warren, of Brooklyn, was killed at the age of 22 in 1969 in the Vietnam War when he fell in the direction of a grenade and shielded at least three men from the blast. His Congressional Medal of Honor citation says Williams’ “ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.” Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, and his Congressional Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to him in 1970. The base will also rename its Stonewall Jackson Drive, which is named after another Confederate general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Advocacy groups and voters who this year persuaded state courts to overturn the Legislature’s congressional redistricting plan asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to avoid hearing arguments on whether such courts must be curtailed in reviewing U.S. House maps. Attorneys representing the state also joined with outside lawyers to file four legal briefs with the justices urging them to reject a petition from Republican legislative leaders to take up the issue. Through their own private lawyers, the GOP lawmakers already asked the court to formally rule on whether a provision in the U.S. Constitution delegating to state legislatures the manner of holding U.S. House elections means that state judges can’t void congressional district lines created by the General Assembly. The authors of Friday’s filings say the Supreme Court already has ruled before that some decision-making on congressional redistricting can be delegated by a state’s citizens. The same holds true when the North Carolina Legislature passed laws two decades ago setting in place the authority of courts to review redistricting plans that they approved, the lawyers wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nPembina: One of the largest employers in northeastern North Dakota is closing later this year. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based New Flyer Industries is shutting down its charter and transit bus manufacturing plant in Pembina, located close to the Canadian border. Pembina Mayor Mike Fitzgerald said company was notified of the decision in a letter. The company told Fitzgerald that it was having difficulty finding qualified employees, a factor in its conversion to electric vehicles, and the plant’s location has become an issue. New Flyer has a plant in Crookston, Minnesota, which is about 100 miles from Pembina. Fitzgerald called the move “devastating” and said it will put more than 200 employees out of work, KFGO radio reports. The Pembina plant opened in 1963.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit pairing photographs from two moments of societal crisis – the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic – aims to help visitors see parallels between the human tolls felt across generations. The show, “Chronicles: The Great Depression and the Pandemic,” opened Saturday at the and runs through Aug. 28. It couples images of day-to-day life gathered by 10 Depression-era photographers and five contemporary Ohio photographers. The 1930s photographers – including Dorothea Lange, Esther Bubley, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Carl Mydans, Gordon Parks, John Vachon and Ben Shahn – were hired by the U.S. government Works Progress Administration’s Farm Security Administration. The Ohio photographers are Autumn Bland, Donald Black, Jr., Angelo Merendino, Jane Alden Stevens and Shane Wynn. Their pictures document the ravages of the coronavirus across different social and economic groups. Special events tied to the exhibit include a talk with co-curators Christine Fowler Shearer and Arnold Tunstall on Sunday, a history lecture on the WPA, an artist talk with Wynn, and classes on smartphone photography and enhancing Instagram accounts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With the state only days away from enacting the toughest ban on abortion in the U.S., questions remained Friday about enforcing the law’s limited exceptions. The law allows abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life “in a medical emergency,” and supporters said doctors still would decide what an emergency is, though that could change later if it becomes perceived as a loophole. There’s also an exception for cases of rape, sexual assault or incest that have been reported to law enforcement, but that doesn’t help victims who don’t report the crimes to police. Abortion providers said they are likely to be cautious because the new law, like a ban at about six weeks enacted earlier and a similar 2021 law in Texas, will expose them to potentially expensive lawsuits over alleged violations. They’re planning to refer some patients to states like Colorado or Kansas, but some won’t be able to manage the extra time or travel involved. Oklahoma will provide a preview of what is in store for other states if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through on a draft opinion leaked earlier this month overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The law also is likely to prompt Oklahoma residents – and Texans who’d traveled to the neighboring state – to go elsewhere to end their pregnancies.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A Democratic state lawmaker is calling for an investigation into a ballot-printing fiasco that will delay results from Tuesday’s primary by weeks, with a key U.S. House race hanging in the balance in a state that prides itself on voter access and election transparency. Tens of thousands of ballots in the state’s third-largest county were printed with blurred barcodes, making them unreadable by vote-counting machines – a mistake that wasn’t caught until ballots were already being returned in the vote-by-mail state. Elections workers must now hand-transfer the votes from those ballots to new ones that can be read in a painstaking process that also raises the possibility of duplication errors. As the scope of the crisis became apparent, local, state and federal lawmakers Friday all escalated their criticism of Clackamas County Elections Clerk Sherry Hall, who defended her actions at a news conference Friday and said she had learned from the mistakes. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who represents voters in the county, called the situation “unreasonable, and untenable,” and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents some Clackamas voters in Congress, called Hall’s slow reaction “unconscionable.” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan demanded a written plan from Hall detailing how she would get results tabulated by June 13, the state deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Summer Lee has won a five-way Democratic primary for a Pittsburgh-based U.S. House seat, making her the favorite in the heavily Democratic district to win the fall general election and become the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Friday was the fourth day of counting ballots after Tuesday’s primary in the closely contested race for the open 12th District seat. Lee, a second-term state House member, lawyer and former labor organizer, comes from the party’s progressive wing. She was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two-time presidential candidate and a leading voice in the Democratic Party’s left wing who came to campaign for Lee. Lee beat out second-place Steve Irwin, who was endorsed by the Allegheny County Democratic Party and backed by prominent Democrats from the county. The seat is open because longtime Rep. Mike Doyle – first elected in 1994 – is not running again. It also has new boundaries since Pennsylvania’s congressional districts were redrawn to account for a decade of demographic changes identified by the 2020 census. Lee will face the Republican nominee of the same name as the outgoing Democratic incumbent – Mike Doyle – in the fall general election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Dr. Anthony Fauci urged graduates of Roger Williams University on Friday to fight what he called the “normalization of untruths,” which has become a growing and more troubling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the face of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus, was the commencement ceremony’s keynote speaker but addressed students at the private Rhode Island college remotely because he had to attend a memorial service for a family member. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have experienced firsthand something that has troubled and saddened me – a deepened divisiveness in our nation,” he said. “Unfortunately, differences of opinion or ideology are propped up by deliberate distortions of reality to the point of fabrications, conspiracy theories, and outright lies.” He told the students to apply the analytic skills they have learned during their time at the university to challenge and renounce untruths, which he called a threat to the nation. “Reject the politicization of science that denigrates evidence and facts,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two new state laws require elementary school teachers to get a 30-minute break each day without students and ban districts from turning over school lunch debt to collection agencies. The bills were passed in the final days of the 2022 General Assembly session and signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster. Both passed the House and Senate unanimously. The break bill requires teachers in elementary school and special education teachers who have students in their classes for most of the day to get 30 minutes without any assigned duties or responsibilities. Teacher groups requested the law, saying some teachers never had time to eat a lunch or even use the bathroom because they were watching students. A second bill prohibits school districts from turning over debt a student owes for school lunches to a collection agency. Supporters said students need to eat regardless of their ability to pay, and turning debt over to a collection agency was too drastic of a step.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled a sex crime conviction doesn’t require an actual victim. The court last week upheld the conviction of a man stemming from a sting operation during the 2017 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Carlocito Slim argued he was just looking for a massage when he responded to an ad on the Backpage website under the headline “Women Seeking Men.” Slim was actually responding to an ad that was a sting setup and unknowingly texted a special agent with South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation. The agent, posing as a pimp, told Slim he could meet a 15-year-old girl. And when Slim showed up at the assigned meeting place with condoms and $200, he was arrested and later convicted of two federal felonies. Slim argued there couldn’t be a conviction because there was no pimp and no crime victim. Defense attorney Terry Pechota told the judges his client simply didn’t understand the text communications and was only looking for a massage, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “He doesn’t ask about whether or not the girl is 16, or whether they’re going to engage in any funny stuff or illegal stuff,” Pechota said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman said Slim knew what was going on and later told investigators he thought he was meeting a girl for sex.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Friday that he doesn’t have a timeline yet on when his administration might roll out a long-blocked school voucher program that saw its biggest legal roadblock removed by the state’s high court last week. The Republican told reporters it was a “good first step” for the Supreme Court to rule Wednesday that the voucher initiative doesn’t violate the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. The decision upends earlier court rulings that have kept the program that passed in 2019 from ever being implemented. The program applies only to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The two counties were among the entities that sued over the program. But the governor also said there are “legal decisions yet to be made” and “a lot of steps that have to come to fruition” before the program can get up and running. “Once we determine the speed with which the court will make its final decisions, then we can move forward with the particulars to make sure this works and fits, and how it is that we roll it out,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMentone: The top elected official in a rural, sparsely populated West Texas county has been arrested after being accused of stealing cattle. Loving County Judge Skeet Jones, 71, and three other men were arrested Friday on charges of livestock theft and engaging in organized criminal activity. All four men were taken to the jail in neighboring Winkler County, where they have since been released on bond. Jones hadn’t returned a call seeking comment Sunday. The arrests came after a yearlong investigation, according to a statement from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. The association has commissioned peace officers known as special rangers who investigate agricultural crimes, including the theft of cattle and horses. The rangers also determine the ownership of stray livestock. The association’s special rangers allege Jones and the others gathered stray cattle and sold them without following procedures set forth in the Texas Agriculture Code. Those procedures include calling the sheriff to report stray livestock and allowing the sheriff to search for the animal’s owner. The association declined to provide additional details about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. The theft of livestock charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the organized criminal activity charge up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southern Utah’s first 24-hour child care center is opening soon, aiming to help families break away from poverty. The new Stepping Stones day care center is slated to open June 1 and will be housed under SwitchPoint, the St. George-based nonprofit that runs and operates the area’s largest homeless shelter, food bank and other programs aimed at helping people living in poverty. The center will stay open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and will aim to help parents and guardians who struggle who pay the costs of child care elsewhere. “We’ve got to create something that can help alleviate keeping families trapped in poverty,” said Carol Holloway, the executive director of Switchpoint, to a packed room of people at a ribbon-cutting event at the center Tuesday. Kamie Blake, the program director for the care center, said it will be the only 24/7 child care center in southern Utah and one of the few in operation in the state. Children as young as 6 weeks old and up to 12 years old will be eligible to attend. At full capacity, Stepping Stones can take up to 270 kids each day and has a kitchen, laundry and sleeping areas to accommodate the round-the-clock operations. There are five classrooms on site, with lessons scheduled based on age.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have created a drug use standards advisory board within the state sentencing commission, saying it “places no limits on which drugs can be contemplated for legalization or the amounts.” The board would determine “the benchmark personal use dosage and the benchmark personal use supply” for regulated and unregulated drugs, with a goal of preventing and reducing the criminalization of personal drug use, according to the bill. Scott, a Republican, said in his letter Thursday to the General Assembly the bill includes “absolutely no recognition” of health and safety impacts of using fentanyl, heroin and other drugs, and it doesn’t acknowledge law enforcement’s role in stopping dealers. Scott also vetoed a bill that would have expanded eligibility for the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent crimes. “Ultimately, I find this bill inconsistent with the State’s responsibilities to keep the public safe,” he wrote. Rep. Selene Colburn, P-Burlington, who supported both bills, said she was upset about the outcome, WCAX-TV reports. “We are not talking about reducing penalties for violent crimes or changing expungement eligibility. We are simply talking about treating people who have used drugs and who have struggled with substance use disorder with dignity and respect and the basic belief that their lives are valuable,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Attorneys for the U.S. government have indicated they will not oppose a plan to lift all remaining restrictions next month on John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington ruled last year that Hinckley can be freed unconditionally in June if he continues to follow the rules placed on him and remains mentally stable as he continues to live in Williamsburg. Hinckley, 66, has indeed remained mentally stable and violated no conditions, according to a letter filed by U.S. attorneys with the court Thursday. That determination was based on letters from the Washington’s Department of Health, which has overseen Hinckley’s care. A court hearing is scheduled for June 1. Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis, when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president and injured three others. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time, after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. She died in July. He signed a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the area last year and began living there with his cat, Theo, according to court filings. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that he’s found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. He’s also shared his music on YouTube.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An invasive European green crab was captured last week in Hood Canal, the farthest south the species has been found in the Salish Sea. Volunteers with Washington Sea Grant trapped the male European green crab in Nick’s Lagoon near Seabeck in Kitsap County, The Seattle Times reports. The organization has been tasked by the state with early detection of the crab’s spread. Washington Sea Grant marine ecologist Emily Grason said in a news release the crab arrived at the lagoon last year, based on its size. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in response will increase trapping there to assess the scope of the green crab presence and try to locally eradicate the species. Gov. Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation in January to address a significant increase in European green crab populations within the Lummi Nation’s sea pond near Bellingham. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age. It also out-competes native crab species and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems. It was first found in Washington’s inland waters in 2016.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that social services workers will receive a 15% pay increase by tapping funds from existing vacant positions after such efforts failed in the Legislature. About 970 employees of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Social Services will receive the raises starting June 18. There are more than 6,500 children in the care of the state. According to the DHHR, there is a 30% vacancy rate statewide for foster care employees. “I told you we’d get this done, and we got it done without spending any excess money,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “I always say we need to mind the store, and we’ve done it the right way. As a result, we’re now able to compensate these people that are doing incredible work.” Employee pay raises and other key provisions were stripped from a social services bill before it died on the final day of the regular legislative session in March. After the pay raises were gutted, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch told a Senate committee that the department would reduce the number of open positions to provide the much-needed raises to child protective services employees. Crouch said Thursday those vacant positions indeed funded the raises.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A disorderly conduct conviction can’t disqualify someone from obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a unanimous decision that could dramatically broaden who can carry hidden firearms, knives and stun guns. The court found that disorderly conduct isn’t a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law and therefore doesn’t disqualify a person from holding a concealed carry license. Justice Jill Karofsky, a member of the court’s liberal minority, concurred but in a separate opinion called on legislators to close a “dangerous loophole” that will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons. Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill a year ago that would have reconciled the language, but it never got got a hearing. “Though legally correct, this result is as nonsensical as it is dangerous,” Karofsky wrote. “When a domestic abuse perpetrator, who has engaged in threats to kill or any other type of domestic violence, has access to a gun, the lethality risk for his victim increases significantly.” The case revolves around Daniel Doubek, of Green Bay. According to court documents, Doubek broke into his estranged wife’s trailer in Door County in 1993 waving a board and shouting threats. He was ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local reservoirs are likely to be nearly drained this summer amid lingering drought in the Snake River basin, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Federal officials predicted Thursday during an annual water meeting at the Teton County Library that reservoirs like Jackson Lake and Palisades could fall to 2%-10% if summer proves particularly hot and dry, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/24/paulies-push-sweet-connie-vr-brain-rewiring-news-around-states/118465756/", "title": "Paulie's Push, sweet Connie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPanola: General Store owner Dorothy Oliver has persuaded and helped almost everyone in her community to get their COVID-19 shots. In her decades living in Panola, Oliver has become one of the most influential people in the area. She is the vice president of the local day care center and on the board of the community center, in addition to owning her store. “All of them know me,” she said of her customers. “They come in, and I just start talking to them like I know them. I don’t have to know you to talk to you.” And she isn’t afraid to ask about their vaccination status. “Back in December, whenever vaccination started, I started with it,” she said. “I went to calling all the older people around in the community, trying to make sure how their mind is and make sure they started thinking on going and getting a shot whenever it got ready for them.” By the time doses were readily available in Alabama, there were not any vaccination sites in the immediate area, with the closest facilities about 40 minutes away. So Oliver volunteered to schedule neighbors’ appointments and drive them to and from the sites. According to Oliver’s records, only about 20 adults in the community of roughly 350 people are left unvaccinated. “I know all my people that haven’t got it,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Three-time Super Bowl champion Mark Schlereth returned home to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. Anchorage Daily News reports the Service High alumnus made a halftime appearance Friday night at West High, where his alma mater squared off against the West Eagles. “I just want to encourage everybody to do your part, to talk to your doctor, and if it’s the right decision for you, please get vaccinated,” Schlereth said. “Please take care of one another.” He has been advocating for COVID-19 shots on social media, and he said the NFL Players Association reached out to him about spreading the word in his home state. Almost 54% of Alaska residents 12 and older have been inoculated, according to the state dashboard. Schlereth, 55, was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder in 1993 while playing for Washington. He said one of the reasons he got the vaccine was to visit with his mother, who has cancer. “I wanted to spend as much time safely with her as possible … so it was just a no-brainer for us,” Schlereth said. He said one of his high school coaches whom he considered a mentor died Thursday from COVID-19. “I just lost a dear, dear friend who refused to get vaccinated, so that hit home for me,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Private businesses can require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but must allow reasonable religious and medical exemptions under state and federal law, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a legal opinion. And they can impose vaccine requirements on patrons as well, as long as they provide reasonable accommodation for customers who can’t take a vaccine because of a disability and don’t discriminate against those who won’t for religious reasons, the Republican wrote in Friday’s opinion. Public schools and universities and local and state government agencies are different because of laws enacted this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Ducey. They are not allowed to require employees or students to get inoculated once the new laws take effect Sept. 29. But private schools can, if they allow exemptions for religious or health reasons. Ducey last week issued an executive order barring state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing law that says health agencies can’t force people to be treated if they comply with sanitary or quarantine rules. A violation carries criminal sanctions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Connie Hamzy, a rock ’n’ roll groupie from the Natural State who was immortalized as “sweet, sweet Connie” in the 1973 Grand Funk Railroad hit “We’re an American Band,” has died. She was 66. “I was determined to become a famous groupie,” Hamzy, who lived in Little Rock, told KTHV in 2019. She told the station she was finishing her senior year of high school when the manager of Grand Funk Railroad called to say her name would be in a song. “I said, ‘Yeah I’ll have to see it to believe it,’ ” she said. But that summer, at the lake with friends, she heard a radio announcer introduce the new song and note that a local girl was in the first few lines, she said. “Out on the road for forty days. Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze. Sweet, sweet Connie, doin’ her act. She had the whole show, and that’s a natural fact.” Hamzy told KTHV she first got backstage at age 15 after her mother, who didn’t want to deal with traffic, dropped her off early to see Steppenwolf at Barton Coliseum. “We’d go out there, and then we’d wander around the backstage area, and one thing would lead to another,” she told KTHV. Hamzy, who worked for a time as a substitute teacher, hung out with groups including Queen, the Eagles and Kiss, KTHV reports. She told the station Van Halen was a particular favorite.\n\nCalifornia\n\nMalibu: Powerful surf washed away a section of a beach access road, and swimmers and surfers were urged to use caution as huge waves from a southern swell battered the Southern California coastline. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted photos Saturday that showed the ground under Westward Beach Road completely collapsed. Beach hazard advisories had mostly expired by Sunday morning, but officials warned that dangerous rip currents and localized flooding were still possible. “We cannot emphasize this enough: surf and swim in front of an open lifeguard tower,” the Department of Beaches and Harbors tweeted. “Check with the nearest lifeguard before entering the water.” Aerial video by CBS 2 News showed huge waves hitting the patio and second-story balconies of a hotel in the Orange County city of Laguna Beach.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: After taking last season off due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bustang rides to Denver Broncos home games are back with service from Fort Collins and Colorado Springs. The state Department of Transportation said the return of rides on its Bustang coaches will begin with the team’s final preseason game at 7 p.m. Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High against the Los Angeles Rams. Service was suspended last year due to the pandemic and restricted capacity at the stadium. This is the fifth season the service has been offered. The round-trip fare is $30 per person. Coaches are climate-controlled and equipped with Wi-Fi, restrooms, USB and power outlets, comfortable seats and wheelchair access. Face masks are required for drivers and passengers, and hand sanitizer wipes will be offered to passengers when boarding the bus. The buses are cleaned and disinfected upon completion of each route and each day’s routes, according to officials. Amber Blake, CDOT’s director of Transit and Rail, said the service provides an alternative for fans, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, provides a designated driver and enhances safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Slot machine revenues generated at the state’s two tribal casinos continue to rebound. Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino report seeing an influx of visitors over the summer as COVID-19 restrictions have eased. Both destinations closed for more than three months at the height of the pandemic last year. Mohegan Sun, owned by the Mohegan Tribe, generated $49.9 million in slot machine revenues in July after paying out winnings. That’s a 5% increase from July 2020 and the most money the casino has retained since August 2019, according to The Day of New London. Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, kept $36.5 million in July, marking a 19.6% increase from the more than $30.5 million in generated in July 2020. It’s the casino’s highest amount since November 2019. Jason Guyot, CEO of Foxwoods, said slot revenues at the site increased by $7.1 million from June to July. To meet increased consumer demand this summer, he said the casino has offered new experiences, including an outdoor pop-up eatery and a “Cocktail Carnival.” Mohegan Sun has also rolled out more promotions and entertainment over the summer, helping to drive traffic, said Jeff Hamilton, the resort casino’s president and CEO.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As housing prices soared over the past year, the dream of homeownership was less achievable in the First State, where buyers need more cash for closing the sale. Delaware has the highest real estate transfer tax in the nation, making the average closing costs the second-highest behind Washington, D.C. On a $250,000 home, the transfer tax due at settlement in Delaware is $10,000, which is usually split between the seller and buyer and must be paid at closing. The buyer can’t roll that amount into the mortgage and pay it off over time. Mia Burch, president of the Delaware Association of Realtors, said she has worked with buyers who were in good financial shape in almost every way but had trouble coming up with all the cash they needed at closing. She calls the transfer tax a “discouragement” tax. In 2017, the Legislature hiked the real estate transfer tax from 3% of the property’s sale price to 4%. It was only supposed to be a temporary increase to help solve the state’s budget deficit, said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek. But four years later, even after a $1 billion budget surplus, the 4% tax is still in place. “Seniors and young people are the ones getting squeezed,” Ramone said. In January, he introduced a bill to reduce the tax to its previous level, but it’s yet to make it to the House floor for a vote.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ten years after an earthquake shook the nation’s capital, repair work is only half done on the National Cathedral, WUSA-TV reports. The Aug. 23, 2011, temblor registered a 5.8 on the Richter scale and dealt extensive damage to buildings across the area. “The quake lasted 58 seconds,” said Joe Alonso, National Cathedral head stonemason. He still can recall every single second of that shake that bent the historic cathedral’s beautiful spires, split its gargoyles and sent chunks of masonry to the ground. “I thought, ‘Wow we’ve got a task ahead of us, that’s for sure,’ ” Alonso said. Repairing the spires and towers is not as simple as slapping some glue on the pieces and putting them back up. “It’s just the nature of the work – everything is handmade, hand-done,” Alonso said. “But that’s how the cathedral was built.” For ten years, the stonemasons have had to reconstruct every single broken piece and reset it hundreds of feet in the air by scaffolding or crane. “What it costs to do this is very expensive, and we are doing (a) sort of a pay-as-you-go,” Alonso said. He believes the 58 seconds were the difference between a slow, tedious repair and complete reconstruction. “If the quake had lasted 2 or 3 more seconds, the stuff that was like a Jenga game would have just come completely down,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The state’s power struggle over wearing masks in school landed Monday before a judge considering a lawsuit that challenges Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order reserving the decision for parents. The three-day hearing before Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper pits pro-mask parents against the Republican governor and state education officials who say parents, not schools, should choose whether their children cover up inside schools. The hearings come as the highly contagious delta variant causes a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths across Florida, where the school year is already being disrupted. Charles Dodson, a former judge representing the parents challenging the governor’s order, in an opening statement that the delta variant affects children more than the previous virus strain and places them at greater risk in crowded schools. He said the Florida Constitution and state law give local school boards the authority to decide health and safety matters affecting their students. Michael Abel, a lawyer for the defendants, said the state’s experts will testify that requiring students to wear masks causes many harms – speaking difficulty, mood changes, breathing issues and depression – while scientists disagree on their effectiveness against the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has found that part of the state’s sweeping new election law that broadly prohibits the photographing of a completed ballot is likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee on Friday granted a preliminary injunction on that section of the law, meaning it cannot be enforced for now. In the same order, he declined to block a number of other provisions that mostly have to do with monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The judge’s order came in a lawsuit filed by the Coalition for Good Governance, an election integrity group, and others. Boulee wrote that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit “have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” that the broad ban on photographing a voted ballot in both public and nonpublic places violates their First Amendment rights. The new law, known as SB 202, also adds a voter ID requirement for mail ballots, shortens the time period for requesting a mail ballot, results in fewer ballot drop boxes available in metro Atlanta, and gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. There are currently eight federal lawsuits challenging parts of the 98-page law enacted earlier this year, including one filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a surge in tourists is leading to increased harassment of sea turtles on a popular North Shore Oahu beach. Hordes of people are crowding turtles at Laniakea Beach Park, known as Turtle Beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said increased patrols are being dispatched to enforce laws against approaching the turtles. “There are packs of 200 people at a time, throughout the day,” said Debbie Herrera, volunteer and education coordinator for turtle conservation group Malama na Honu. The state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement has assigned officers to Laniakea. “Typically, if there’s a uniformed officer standing on the beach, people are not going to break the law in front of them,” said Jason Redulla, division chief. Harassment of turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals led Gov. David Ige to warn that violators will be prosecuted if caught. Tourists at Laniakea Beach tell Malama na Honu they didn’t know touching turtles was illegal, Herrera said. Most follow the rules once informed, but there have been a “very few who refuse, despite dozens of cautionary signs or warnings from volunteers, to give green sea turtles on the beach or in the ocean wide berth,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: One of two U.S. district judges for Idaho announced seven months ago that he’d take senior status in August, but there’s still no official nominee to replace him. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill planned to continue to hear a full caseload when he took senior status Aug. 16, but expected Idaho to have a new district judge to replace him by then – effectively giving the state the third judge it has needed for decades, the Idaho Press reports. “We desperately need the help,” Winmill said. But there’s been no word from the White House about a nominee for the now-open second federal judgeship, though Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials interviewed candidates last winter and submitted an all-female shortlist of four nominees to the Biden administration in March: Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson, and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Traditionally, state senators are given a big say in federal district judge nominees, but that system was jettisoned under the Trump administration. The Senate – where Democrats hold a thin majority – must confirm any nominee by simple majority. It’s unclear what role Idaho’s Republican senators will play in the nomination.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials have dropped a “do not eat” advisory for sport fish in the Illinois River for the first time since the 1970s. The Illinois Department of Public Health relaxed the warning because concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have declined, the Chicago Tribune reports. The toxic contaminants were banned in 1979 but stick around in the environment, prompting the advisory. IDPH issues advisories annually based on fish samples collected from 40 to 50 streams, rivers and inland lakes, as well as from four stations in Lake Michigan. They are geared toward vulnerable populations including pregnant and nursing women, along with children younger than age 15. The department said there is no known immediate health hazard from eating contaminated fish in Illinois. But there are “concerns about the effects of long-term, low-level exposure” to contaminants including PCBs. Guidance also was relaxed for some Lake Michigan fish, including whitefish and rainbow trout. Recommended consumption is now no more than one meal a week. Previous guidance was to limit consumption to once per month.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Hoosier Lottery saw record profits in the past year as its ticket sales soared 26% from the year before. That big jump was fueled by 27% growth in scratch-off ticket sales that accounted for nearly 80% of the lottery’s $1.74 billion in revenue during the year period ending June 30, officials told the State Lottery Commission this past week. Lottery administrators had projected a slight drop in sales because of worries about coronavirus-related shutdowns and the possible economic impact. But the boost in revenue will result in the lottery sending a record $375 million in profits to the state – up about $71 million, or 23%, from the year before. That’s even higher than the $368 million profits that lottery officials had projected in May. “These are really extraordinary numbers,” Lottery Commission Chairman William Zielke said. “It certainly reflects the efforts of a lot of people who tried to keep it going (through the pandemic).” The state directs about $235 million of the lottery profits toward reducing auto excise taxes, with $60 million going to pension funds for teachers, police officers and firefighters. The scratch-off tickets sales growth follows the lottery’s long-term strategy to attract more players enticed by the regular release of new instant games.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: When state Sen. Joe Bolkcom asked in June how much it would cost to deploy Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Department of Public Safety said expenses wouldn’t be calculated until the mission was completed. The response ignored that the state agency had run its own internal cost estimate a week before the since-completed deployment had even been made public, according to records reviewed by the Des Moines Register. The department recently released more than 2,200 pages of emails in response to a joint records request from the Register and the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Gov. Kim Reynolds announced June 24 that troopers would be deployed to the border after Texas asked for help with an influx of migrants. The announcement led legislators and the media to ask questions of the Department of Public Safety and Iowa State Patrol. At the onset, Iowa officials issued scant details about the operations, citing concerns for officer safety. They did not cite that for costs. On June 17, Iowa State Patrol Maj. Robert Hansen sent top department officials an initial cost estimate: $383,700.24 to cover a 16-day deployment of 28 troopers of various ranks. Initial cost estimates after they returned were shy of $300,000, department Commissioner Stephan Bayens said at a July 28 news conference.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: If the Evel Knievel museum moves to Las Vegas, the owner of the museum dedicated to the daredevil has pledged to repay $117,000 it has received from the city of Topeka since it opened in 2017. It was reported earlier this month that the museum dedicated to the career of Robert Craig Knievel, who became known for his death-defying stunts and tricks on motorbikes, may move to the Las Vegas Arts District. Museum owner Mike Patterson told city officials in a meeting last week that he believes it is appropriate to repay the city even though it might not be required in the incentive contract the museum signed. Patterson said private loans were the main source of funding for the roughly $3.5 million museum. But it was also slated to receive up to $300,000 from the city over 12 years if it continued operating in Topeka. The money it received came from the city’s tax on hotel stays. City Council member Spencer Duncan said Topeka will make sure future incentive contracts with businesses include terms that require businesses to repay the incentives they received if they do leave the city.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear has declared this week Healthcare Heroes Appreciation Week in honor of the doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic staff, and others who have helped the Bluegrass State during the COVID-19 pandemic. “They are heroes. They have earned that title,” Beshear said at a press briefing Thursday, urging local businesses and community members to find ways to show gratitude for health care workers. The most important way, he said, is to get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Let’s make sure that everywhere these health care heroes go, they see how much we care,” the Democratic governor said. Following a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling impacting his executive authority, Beshear on Monday rescinded his executive order requiring masks in schools. The move came a day before a federal judge is scheduled to decide whether to continue a temporary restraining order preventing the mandate from being enforced. Without an order to block, the legal challenge is likely moot. A separate mask mandate for public schools from the Kentucky Department of Education still stands, as does a similar measure for child care centers from the Department of Public Health. Without a mandate in place, private schools across the state are now able to adopt mask-optional policies.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 20 government agencies, universities and electric utilities in the state soon will be getting electric vehicle charging stations worth more than $1.7 million. The Department of Environmental Quality is awarding grants to 26 entities for 82 charging stations, using money from the state’s $19.8 million share from a settlement worth nearly $3 billion between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen over violations of the Clean Air Act, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Volkswagen sold about 590,000 vehicles equipped with devices that worked against their air pollution control features, resulting in increased emissions of nitrogen oxide. Almost $12 million of Louisiana’s share of the 2016 settlement was set aside to replace 351 diesel engine buses owned by 16 school boards. The new engines will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Another $7.3 million was given to the state Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Agriculture to replace old diesel equipment and vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s $1,500 bonus to attract new workers back to the workforce this summer during the pandemic hasn’t been successful. Only about 5% of the 7,500 people whom the $10 million program could cover have been declared provisionally eligible, the Bangor Daily News reports. An extended deadline to file applications closed Friday. The bonus for new employees who work at least eight weeks and meet other criteria equates to about two weeks of unemployment pay. It may not have been enough to entice workers to give up benefits or to get overworked employers to handle the extra paperwork that the program entails, said Steve Hewins, executive director of the industry group HospitalityMaine. Maine’s neighbor to the west has had a bit more success. New Hampshire, which stopped the enhanced unemployment benefits in June, drew 700 applicants to its $1,000 return-to-work program in the first four weeks after it started July 19. In contrast, Maine had attracted only 400 applicants since mid-June.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The woeful record of the Baltimore Orioles is combining with the coronavirus pandemic to cost the state millions of dollars in rent payments. The Baltimore Sun reports the Major League Baseball team’s rent payments to the Maryland Stadium Authority have dropped precipitously in the past year due to low attendance and loss of ballpark-generated revenue. The Orioles paid $1.6 million in rent to the Stadium Authority for the use of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in the fiscal year ending June 30. The team’s average annual rent of its 30-year lease has been $6.8 million. The rent payments are based on a percentage of ticket sales, concessions, parking and stadium advertising. The team has the worst record in the majors, and attendance is sparse. During the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, fans were not allowed in the stadium at all. The rent money is used specifically for the maintenance of the ballpark. Stadium officials say they have curtailed maintenance expenses accordingly. The rent losses are in addition to the loss of admission taxes on ticket sales. The newspaper based its reporting on data obtained under the state’s Public Information Act.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNatick: A retired flight attendant pushing an airline beverage cart more than 200 miles from Boston to New York City to honor colleagues who died during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is well on his way. Paul Veneto, 62, resumed his 20th anniversary journey Monday after a night at the Verve Hotel in Natick, two days after starting his trek at Logan International Airport and a day after braving drenching rains from the Henri storm system. He plans on pushing the cart – decorated with photos of all the 9/11 airline crews for inspiration and courage – to ground zero by Sept. 10. “I look on top of this cart, I see these crew members’ faces, every time my legs hurt, it’s cold, rainy, they’re smiling back at me, the pain goes away,” Veneto said Saturday before he departed. The walk called Paulie’s Push will benefit the families of his former colleagues as well as Power Forward 25, a nonprofit that assists people dealing with addiction. Veneto himself is in recovery from an opioid dependency caused in part by the attacks. “I turned my life around to be able to recognize these guys who were never recognized,” he said Saturday. United Flight 175, which was flown into the World Trade Center’s south tower, was Veneto’s regular run. But he had the day off Sept. 11, 2001. The Braintree resident spent 30 years as a flight attendant for five different airlines.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Bloomfield Township woman who won the grand $2 million prize in the state’s COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes said Monday that she and her husband will save money for their three kids’ college education, remodel their house and donate a portion to improve mental health services. When the pandemic struck in 2020, Christine Duval left her full-time job as a project manager for a language training company in Troy to help her daughter, now 10, with remote learning after her school closed. She and her husband got their first COVID-19 shots in early April and their second ones weeks later. Their 18- and 15-year-old sons also are vaccinated. Winning $2 million “will help us achieve all of our dreams,” Duval said. “We are really lucky and want to give back to those in need. The pandemic was tough on everyone, and we believe the need for providing services that promote positive mental health care is more important than ever.” The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes program was designed to boost the vaccination rate in July. The weekly number of people getting a first shot across the state rose for four straight weeks between July 11 and Aug. 7 before dropping in the past two weeks. About 65% of residents ages 16 and up have received at least one dose, federal data shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Igor Vovkovinskiy, the tallest man in the United States, has died at age 38. His family said the Ukrainian-born Vovkovinskiy died of heart disease Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. His mother, Svetlana Vovkovinska, an ICU nurse at Mayo, initially posted about his death on Facebook. Vovkovinskiy came to the Mayo Clinic in 1989 as a child seeking treatment. A tumor pressing against his pituitary gland caused it to secrete abnormal levels of growth hormone. He grew to become the tallest man in the U.S. at 7 feet, 8.33 inches and ended up staying in Rochester. His older brother, Oleh Ladan of Brooklyn Park, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that Vovkovinskiy was a celebrity when he arrived from Ukraine because of his size and the flickering Cold War of the late 1980s. But Ladan said Vovkovinskiy “would have rather lived a normal life than be known.” Vovkovinskiy appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” and was called out by President Barack Obama during a campaign rally in 2009, when the president noticed him near the stage wearing a T-shirt that read: “World’s Biggest Obama Supporter.” In 2013, he carried the Ukrainian contestant onto the stage to perform in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Mississippi Poison Control Center officials say they are receiving an influx of calls from people trying to treat COVID-19 by using anti-parasite medicine purchased at livestock stores. At least 70% of recent calls to the center have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin purchased at livestock supply centers, Mississippi Department of Health officials said. Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization, though no hospitalizations have been reported. Most callers – 85% – have had mild symptoms, according to the Department of Health. “Patients should be advised to not take any medications intended to treat animals and should be instructed to only take ivermectin as prescribed by their physician,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a memo Friday. “Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans.” Ivermectin tablets are approved for human use at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical formulations for head lice and skin conditions. Ivermectin is not a drug for treating viruses.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Two groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions argued in a petition filed Monday that a man who has spent more than 20 years in prison for killing his mother did not commit the crime. Michael Politte was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2002. He was 14 when his mother, Rita Politte, was burned to death inside their home in Hopewell, eastern Missouri, in 1998. The Midwest Innocence Project and the MacArthur Justice Center argue in the petition filed with the Missouri Court of Appeals Western District that Politte was convicted because of a biased investigation, faulty science and an incompetent defense at trial. Michael Politte and a friend were sleeping when they awoke to smoke early Dec. 5, 1998. Michael told authorities he found his mother’s burning body in her bedroom as he and his friend tried to escape, according to the petition. She also suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The petition alleges fire investigators quickly decided the fire was started with gasoline, and police immediately zeroed in on her son as a suspect, although no blood or other injuries were found on him. Investigators also said he did not show much emotion or remorse in the following days. Law enforcement did not investigate other viable suspects, the attorneys say.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge has ordered the director of the state’s public defender office to appear before him next month to explain why her office is failing to assign public defenders to Billings-area cases in a timely manner and why she shouldn’t be held in contempt of court. District Judge Donald Harris set a Sept. 13 hearing for Rhonda Lindquist, The Billings Gazette reports. The director of the Office of Public Defender is required to ensure that qualified attorneys are immediately assigned after a judge assigns cases to the public defender’s office, according to Harris’ order, which was signed Tuesday. At times, public defenders have a conflict of interest in representing a defendant. When that happens, their case is assigned to the agency’s Conflict Office to hire an outside attorney. The managing attorney for the Conflict Office told Harris that as of July 31, his office had a backlog of 663 unassigned cases. State law requires the Office of Public Defender to immediately assign a lawyer to any case in which a judge designates the office as counsel. Harris said the office has not been able to meet this obligation for months, causing “significant delays in conducting court proceedings and jeopardizes the administration of justice.” The state’s jobs website lists postings for three public defenders and an appellate defender.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state currently appears relatively safe on some national websites tracking the spread of COVID-19, but state health officials say those maps aren’t accurate. The problem is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using different data for Nebraska since the state retired its website that reported coronavirus figures daily and started reporting updates weekly with fewer details. So two-thirds of Nebraska’s counties shouldn’t be colored blue on the CDC map, indicating low COVID-19 transmission rates, at a time when cases are surging statewide, the Omaha World-Herald reports. “The color blue on the map may not be an accurate representation of transmission rates,” said Olga Dack, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Over the past two weeks, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has nearly doubled from 374.14 new cases per day Aug. 6 to 727.57 new cases per day Friday. In its most recent update, the state said Wednesday that 2,676 cases had been reported in the previous week – more than 10 times higher than the 253 cases per week the state reported in late June. Dack said the state continues to report county-level virus data to the CDC, but the agency hasn’t been using that for some technical reasons.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Several organizations led by women of color have banded together to shed light on the ways the state’s low-income and diverse communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution. The advocacy groups are creating a website, breathefreenv.com, that aims to raise awareness about climate change and steps that can be taken to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, and lower energy costs for families, especially in low-income communities. Erika Washington, executive director of Make It Work Nevada, one of the groups involved in the effort, told the Las Vegas Sun that Black communities have not received as much outreach about climate change or the environment as white communities. “It’s been very white-led for a very long time,” said Washington, who is Black. “You have to include the people who are closest to the issue in order to actually make any sort of change.” Along with Make It Work Nevada, other groups participating include Battle Born Progress, CHISPA, Make the Road Nevada, Mi Familia Vota Nevada, the Faith Organizing Alliance and the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund. All seven groups are led by women of color.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Revenue has completed a three-year project aimed at providing a better online experience for taxpayers. The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, launched the first phase of its online user portal and revenue management system in 2019. The final phase of the Granite Tax Connect portal was completed this month, allowing tax preparers and others to file taxes electronically, schedule automated payments, check on the status of refunds, and complete other tasks. Officials said the system could serve about 148,000 taxpayers. The portal also can be used to anonymously report suspected tax fraud.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state joined a small but growing list of places Monday to require COVID-19 vaccinations for teachers and state workers or for them to undergo regular coronavirus testing. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the new mandate during a news conference, saying pre-K-12 teachers and staff and state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or get tested once or twice a week. New Jersey has about 130,000 public school teachers, 1.3 million public school students and an estimated 70,000 state workers. “Scientific data shows that vaccination and testing requirements, coupled with strong masking policies, are the best tools for keeping our schools and communities safe for in-person activities,” Murphy said. The Democratic governor, who’s running for reelection this year, announced the move just as schools across the state prepare to begin the new academic year. The decision follows an announcement earlier this month to require staff, students and visitors to wear masks on school grounds. The state’s biggest teachers union, the New Jersey Education Association, supported the order, as did the state’s School Nurses Association and the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The ritual burning of a giant, ghostly marionette in the city will be a hybrid event this year. Organizers of the Zozobra burning said they are planning to limit in-person attendance to 10,000 while also broadcasting the event on television and online. The nighttime spectacle that’s been transformed by modern pyrotechnics is in its 97th year. A team of a dozen puppeteers heaves on cords to flex the groaning marionette’s arms, head and jaw. Will Shuster, a painter from Philadelphia who migrated to the Southwest, created Zozobra, a name derived from a Spanish word for “anguish.” Donations from energy companies ensured the event could move forward Sept. 3. It typically happens around Santa Fe’s weeklong community fiestas that include historic and religious processions. Anyone attending in person must prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of the event. Face masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe uses the event to raise money for youth charities. Organizers said they’ll tweak the event as needed to comply with federal and state public health orders.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Andrew Cuomo defended his record over a decade as governor and portrayed himself as the victim of a “media frenzy” Monday as he prepared for a midnight power transfer that will make Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul the state’s first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat, was set to end his term at 11:59 p.m., just under two weeks after he announced he would resign rather than face a likely impeachment battle over sexual harassment allegations. In a prerecorded farewell address released at noon, Cuomo boasted of making government effective in his years in office, cited his work battling the COVID-19 pandemic and struck a defiant tone on the harassment allegations. He said the report that triggered his resignation – a scathing account of what Attorney General Letitia James said was sexual harassment or inappropriate touching of 11 women – was “designed to be a political firecracker on an explosive topic, and it did work,” Cuomo said. He also touted his “progressive” record and positioned himself as a bulwark against his party’s left-wing faction that he said wants to “defund the police” and “demonize businesses.” He touted New York’s long-awaited passage of same-sex marriage under his administration, as well as gun control legislation and a law setting an eventual statewide $15 minimum wage.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of state residents who have been convicted of felonies but whose current punishments don’t include prison time can register to vote and cast ballots, a judicial panel declared Monday. Several civil rights groups and ex-offenders who sued legislative leaders and state officials in 2019 argue the current 1973 law is unconstitutional by denying the right to vote to people who have completed their active sentences or received no such sentence, such as people on probation. They said the rules disproportionately affect Black residents. In a brief hearing following a trial last week challenging North Carolina’s voting restrictions upon felons, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell said two judges on the three-judge panel have agreed they will issue a formal order soon allowing more felony offenders to vote. The judges are acting before issuing a final ruling from the trial, as voting in October municipal elections begins next month. The law says felons can register to vote again once they complete all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. With Bell’s ruling, felons who only must complete these punishments that have no element of incarceration can register again.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A petroleum company has reported a saltwater spill in northwestern North Dakota to state regulators. The Bismarck Tribune reports Whiting Oil and Gas says the spill occurred Thursday. The company told regulators that a broken fitting in a pipeline system operated by Goodnight Midstream resulted in the spill at a well site 11 miles south of Stanley in Mountrail County. The company said 1,400 barrels containing 58,800 gallons of saltwater spilled but were contained, and most of the fluid has been recovered. Saltwater, also known as brine, can come up along with oil and gas from a well. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division said a state inspector has visited the site and will monitor cleanup efforts.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: More than 120 activists, scholars, pastors, students and average citizens attended the first hearing Monday of a new panel charged with redrawing state legislative districts for the next 10 years, most advocating new maps that are more fair and representative. Witnesses at the first of nine public hearings of the Ohio Redistricting Commission at Cleveland State University maligned the current gerrymandered maps and called the process disheartening, embarrassing, demoralizing and unfair. “My vote doesn’t count,” Daisie Reish, 77, of Grafton, told the panel. “I call my representatives constantly, and they never vote for me. They always vote the opposite.” Person after person – young, old, Black, Muslim, immigrant, and people whose families have lived in the area for generations – told the panel they feel disadvantaged and unheard by their government as a result of the current district maps. Meanwhile, Tom Hach, executive director of Free Ohio Now, complained that all nine of the commission’s hearings will be held at universities, which he said don’t attract a diversity of political participation. He called the process unfair and said commissioners, the majority of whom are Republicans, were being bullied by Democrats. An Associated Press analysis has found Ohio to have some of the nation’s most gerrymandered maps.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Blocks from where she initiated one of the nation’s first sit-in movements, civil rights icon Clara Luper is now memorialized in the name of the city’s downtown post office. Luper’s descendants, former students and original “sit-inners” joined local dignitaries Saturday for the dedication of the Clara Luper Post Office Building, formerly called the Center City Station. Luper’s daughter, Chelle Luper Wilson, said her mother would want others to take it as a call to action against inequality. “One of the things I know she would say is she never wanted her name to just be a symbolic gesture,” Wilson said. “She was never about symbolism without any action. She was about structural and systemic change. I know she would want people whenever they see her name not to just think, ‘Oh great, what a great woman,’ but hope it sparks them to become passionate about a cause.” Luper, a longtime public school teacher, died in 2011 at age 88. The renaming coincided with the 63rd anniversary of the Oklahoma City sit-in movement. Luper and a group of Black schoolchildren arrived at the whites-only lunch counter of Katz Drug Store on Aug. 19, 1958, and refused to leave until they were served. It was the beginning of a successful six-year campaign to end racial segregation in Oklahoma City establishments.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Opposing rallies that drew hundreds of people sparked clashes Sunday. The two groups had gathered in different parts of the city after a far-right group changed the location of its event. The right-wing rally drew about 100 people in a parking lot of a former Kmart store, and clashes began as it wound down, KOIN-TV reports. A van tried to drive into the parking lot but crashed, and the driver ran away. Demonstrators then began igniting fireworks and similar devices. It was not immediately clear whether anyone suffered serious injuries. Later, shots were fired near demonstrators downtown. Dustin Brandon Ferreira, 37, a left-wing activist, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he was with others Sunday evening when a man used a slur against a Black man in the group and then fired multiple rounds in their direction. Portland police said the man was arrested. No one was injured. Demonstrations associated with anti-fascists had earlier drawn more than 200 people downtown. The plans for the opposing demonstrations had prompted Portland police to call in all available police personnel. Sunday’s event fell on the one-year anniversary of a particularly violent political clash in which opposing groups brawled on the street next to police headquarters for hours.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More drivers have been hitting the road as coronavirus restrictions have loosened, and it’s showing in the number of those who have been caught speeding through photo-enforced construction zones. The state has issued more than 220,000 violations in the first seven months of this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Nearly $2.9 million has been collected in fines so far, higher than the $1.7 million remitted in 2020, said Jennifer Kuntch, a spokeswoman for PennDOT. Drivers receive a warning for the first offense, but second and subsequent violations carry a fine. Traffic volumes were down last year because of the pandemic, and that led to fewer violations than what might have been expected, Kuntch said. Meanwhile, the program remains on track to double its speed camera deployments this year. PennDOT is expecting to see a downward trend in violations through the rest of the year, Kuntch said. Based on evaluating Maryland’s trends and in having consistent deployments to the same work zones in Pennsylvania, drivers begin to comply with the speed limits, which leads to fewer violations, she said. In addition, drivers tend to watch their speed after getting their first warning.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are warning residents about a fake form circulating that purports to give the bearer a medical or religious exemption from coronavirus mask requirements. The certificate even includes a Rhode Island Department of Health logo, the agency said in a tweet Sunday. “It was not developed by RIDOH or any official source, should not be filled out, and should not/will not be accepted by any entity, as the form is not legitimate,” the department wrote in the tweet. The agency did not say where the fake certificate originated. The state has recently been restoring mask mandates for some indoor spaces in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus’ delta variant. Last week Gov. Daniel McKee issued an executive order requiring masks in K-12 schools for the upcoming school year regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. Before the order, McKee had simply recommended masks for schoolchildren, leaving the final decision up to individual school districts. But state officials said more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s new coronavirus cases are among children under the age of 12 who are not yet eligible for a vaccination against the disease.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Prosecutors are now required to share evidence of innocence they find even after a defendant is convicted of a crime. The changes to the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct were announced last week, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina is joining about two dozen other states with the rules, which were first developed by the American Bar Association in 2008. They require a prosecutor to disclose any information when they become aware of “credible, material” evidence that indicates a defendant was wrongfully convicted to the defendant or defense attorney as well as the chief prosecutor where the person was tried. Prosecutors who have “clear and convincing” evidence that a person was wrongfully convicted in their jurisdiction then have an ethical obligation to remedy the conviction, according to the new rules. Prosecutors will have discretion to determine what exactly crosses the threshold of the new rules, said John Freeman, professor emeritus for the University of South Carolina School of Law. The rules also protect a defendant even after exhausting all normal appeals, Freeman said. “What this says, basically, is that so long as there is a possibility of proof surfacing that shows that the guy is innocent, it ain’t over,” he said. “And, frankly, isn’t that the way it should be?”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state is facing a shortage of nurses at a time when they are needed most, officials say. South Dakota News Watch reports that stress, long hours and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused more nurses than usual to leave the field, move to other states or retire early. From 2015 to 2016, about 1,700 registered nurses left South Dakota. Last year, more than 2,500 nurses dropped out of the state workforce. “The pandemic just kind of burned them out,” said Michelle Bruns, a spokeswoman for the nursing program at Oglala Lakota College. “It’s a tough situation.” The state’s higher education system has not produced enough nursing graduates to keep up with a growing population and rising demand for health care services, and educators are scrambling to find ways to lure more students and produce degrees more quickly. Meanwhile, a shortage of nurses in other states has raised competition to attract new graduates and experienced providers, but South Dakota health care systems are at a competitive disadvantage because median pay for nurses in the state is the lowest in the nation, according to federal labor data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The University of Tennessee announced Monday that it will extend its mask mandate to all indoor public spaces due to the ongoing spike in coronavirus cases and increasing hospitalizations. UT had been under a temporary mask mandate that only applied to classrooms, laboratories and indoor academic student events. Officials say the new requirement will extend to all indoor public spaces, but exceptions will include private offices, residence hall rooms and while engaging in fitness activities. According to a news release, the university will “re-evaluate the need for the expanded face-covering requirement by Sept. 7.” “While we are trying to do our part to keep our campuses healthy, we continue to stress the importance of getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” UT System President Randy Boyd said in a statement. As of Monday, Tennessee has seen 13,135 COVID-19-related deaths to date, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. That death count is the 15th highest in the country overall and the 24th highest per capita at 194 deaths per 100,000 people. The state is averaging 2,508.3 current COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to data through Aug. 20 from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Dell Medical School at the University of Texas is beginning a three-year study using video games and virtual reality to try to rewire the brains of teens with epilepsy. It’s taking the concept of neuroplasticity – that brains can create new pathways after an injury – and seeing if brains also can create the new pathways before the injury ever occurs. In this case, the injury is surgery to the affected area of the brain that is causing the epileptic seizures. The study is funded by a $2.5 million grant from the Coleman Fung Foundation. Fung is the founder of software company Open Link Financials Inc., and his Austin-based business venture, Blue Goji, is a wellness technology company that uses treadmills, virtual reality and video gaming to create a fitness experience. Dell Medical School will receive two Infinity treadmill virtual realty game systems from Blue Goji to use in the study. Dr. David Paydarfar, chair of Dell Medical School’s department of neurology and the study’s lead researcher, said that while people have studied neuroplasticity for decades, this study will actually implement the research. Previously, it was like studying rocket science without trying to go to the moon. The study is targeting 15- to 20-year-olds with epilepsy who need to have surgery to stop their seizures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A ban on school districts requiring masks is forcing parents of vulnerable kids to wrestle with the painful choice of whether to risk coronavirus infections at school or keep them at home yet again, according to a lawsuit filed Monday. Parents like Jessica Pyper say a Utah law that blocks districts from passing mandates wrongly prevents children from getting a safe education. She wants her 10-year-old son, Ryker, to join his fifth grade classmates this year, but his Type 1 diabetes puts him at serious risk. “It just sort of seems like nobody cares,” she said. “Kids with disabilities often get left behind. They don’t get considered when these types of decisions are being made.” The case filed by a group of nine parents is the latest U.S. lawsuit of its kind from families and educators concerned about school without masks as the highly contagious delta variant surges. Officials, mostly Republican, contend that there are downsides to kids being masked all day and that parents should have the power to decide whether to put them on children, who tend to be less vulnerable to the virus than older adults. The lawsuit was filed against Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, whose office didn’t immediately respond to messages requesting comment, and Republican Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, who declined comment.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Agency of Commerce and Community Development has launched its latest relocation program to get workers to move to Vermont – especially cooks, servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. The reimbursement grants are for up to $7,500 for “eligible expenses” after moving. The online application for the grants requires proof of residency and documentation of eligible expenses. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2018, the Legislature created the remote worker grant program, which offered reimbursement grants of up to $10,000 for workers who could relocate to the state and bring their current job with them. The next year, in 2019, the Legislature created the worker relocation grant program, which offered reimbursement grants to move to the state and take a job. The two programs together have awarded more than 300 grants to “newly settled Vermonters” in towns across the state, according to a news release. The worker relocation program is available to those who relocate to Vermont on or after July 1, 2021, and fill one of the qualifying positions with a Vermont employer. Remote worker grants are for those who relocate on or after Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Monday urged all employers to require COVID-19 vaccines for eligible workers, sharpening a policy debate in the governor’s race over how best to deal with the pandemic. McAuliffe’s call followed a decision by federal regulators to give full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The former governor now seeking a second term has previously urged Virginia health systems and school divisions to issue mandates and required his own campaign staff to be fully inoculated. McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former business executive and political newcomer, in the November general election. Youngkin has consistently urged Virginians to get COVID-19 shots but said he opposes vaccine or mask mandates. At a campaign event last week, the former co-CEO of the Carlyle Group was asked about his approach to managing the pandemic as the delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. “First of all, we pray it’s behind us every day,” he said. “My expectation is, this virus is tough. And so first thing that I would ask everybody to do is get the vaccine.” He said in a statement Monday that McAuliffe was trying to “bully” Virginians and businesses into compliance with a step that will “clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again.”\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Authorities say they have found the first Asian giant hornet nest of 2021 in a rural area of the state, about a quarter-mile from where a resident reported seeing one of the hornets earlier this month. The Washington State Department of Agriculture narrowed the search area last week and located the nest east of Blaine, department officials said. Crews found the nest Thursday after they followed a hornet that was equipped with a tracking device, KOMO reports. Crews were able to net and tag three hornets between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17. State entomologists will now develop a plan to eradicate the nest, most likely this week. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canadian border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: An annual festival that celebrates a local legend about a “Mothman” has been called off for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant announced the festival’s cancellation Thursday. It had been set for next month. The organizers said in a statement that thousands of people pack the town along the Ohio River during the festival and that local health officials predict rising COVID-19 cases could peak around that time. “We are disappointed, but it was not an easy decision to make, we can assure you of that,” the statement said. Mothman is a mysterious creature with glowing red eyes that witnesses described seeing in 1966 and 1967. It was the subject of the 2002 film “The Mothman Prophecies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Residents who get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine between Aug. 20 and Labor Day will receive a $100 gift card, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday. The reward being offered just as students return to school is Wisconsin’s latest incentive designed to entice those who have yet to be inoculated to receive the shots. As of Monday, just over 50% of the state’s entire population and 61% of adult residents were fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Many other states have offered similar programs to get more people vaccinated. Recently in Wisconsin, attendees at the state fair who got vaccinated received a free cream puff. More than 600 fairgoers took advantage of that promotion. The $100 Visa gift card will be available to anyone age 12 and up who gets their first shot during the 18-day eligibility window that closes Sept. 6. To receive the gift card, those being vaccinated will need to fill out an application form, available at 100.wisconsin.gov. The cards will be mailed up to six weeks later. Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths caused by the more contagious delta variant have spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: The outdoor gear and clothing company Patagonia has stopped providing its merchandise for sale at a Wyoming ski resort to protest the owners’ sponsorship of a Republican fundraiser featuring Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other top supporters of former President Donald Trump. Well known for decades for its outspoken support of progressive causes and environmentalism, Patagonia in the past has brought unwanted attention to Facebook and Instagram and the Outdoor Retailer shows in Salt Lake City. Now, the company’s activism could spell trouble – among left-leaning skiers, at least – for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. A major tourism destination in Wyoming, the resort known for its bright red gondola car and logo with a silhouetted bucking horse and rider is among the best-known brands from one of the most Republican states. “We join with the local community that is using its voice in protest. We will continue to use our business to advocate for stronger policies to protect our planet, end hate speech and support voting rights and a strong democracy,” Patagonia spokeswoman Corley Kenna said in a statement. The boycott, first reported by WyoFile, means Patagonia merchandise won’t be available in three shops at the resort that Kenna said were Patagonia’s largest account in Jackson Hole.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}]}

Several SEALs earned theirs for intense combat in Ramadi, others for rescuing hostages in Afghanistan. The Navy also honored the deadly efficiency of the “American Sniper,” the late SEAL Chris Kyle.\n\nAlmost one in five of the military’s most prestigious honors in all the services have been awarded privately since America went to war in 2001 because the missions were classified. The Medal of Honor is the highest commendation, followed by service crosses and the Silver Star. In February, the Pentagon announced plans to review more than 1,000 of the nation’s top awards bestowed since 9/11 to determine if they should be upgraded. The secret Navy Crosses and Silver Stars are among those under review, along with a similar number issued for the Army’s classified commando missions\n\n\"Awards and medals have a sacred role in military culture,\" said Brad Carson, the Pentagon's former civilian chief for personnel who advocated for the review. \"They are a small ribbon symbolizing enormous sacrifice. It is important that we recognize service members for their heroism. And after 15 years of war, it is appropriate to review awards to make sure we applied the criteria correctly and uniformly. That's especially true when so many missions were necessarily classified and awards given quietly. That's why we pushed this review. It is about keeping faith with the troops.\"\n\nThe citations that accompanied the two Navy Cross and 112 Silver Star medals begin as form letters under letterhead from the Secretary of the Navy. The Pentagon withheld names to protect the service member and his family, and deletes details that could affect national security.\n\n“The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the NAVY CROSS or SILVER STAR to…” The rank of the SEAL or Marine follows but the names are redacted in the documents. For those killed in action, the President “takes pride” in awarding the medal.\n\nPentagon may upgrade hundreds of troops to possible Medals of Honor\n\nNext, in less than a page, come astounding feats of bravery, selflessness and will.\n\nTwo Navy Crosses, second only to the Medal of Honor, are among the Navy documents. The first, on Aug. 9, 2009, a Navy SEAL, his name blacked out like others in the report, was leading a small unit when their base came “under an intense coordinated attack” in Afghanistan. A sniper wounded the unit’s medic, and the SEAL braved direct gunfire to drag the man to safety.\n\nAt the same time, a rocket-propelled grenade smashed through the wall of the unit’s arsenal, sparking a major fire. “With a catastrophic explosion imminent,” the SEAL evacuated the base. He then ran repeatedly into the arsenal to haul out crates of explosives to uncover the “smoldering and undetonated warhead, which he removed with his bare hands.” He left the compound, making several trips to dump explosives in a nearby river, all the while being shot at.\n\n“His repeated heroic actions and decisive leadership, under fire, saved the lives of United States soldiers and several Afghan elders and prevented the sole hardened structure in the village from being breached,” the citation reads.\n\nMissing from the citations is any mention of SEAL Team 6 and its mission into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. President Obama did provide the commandos with the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest honor for a military unit. The Navy did not rule out the possibility that individual medals were awarded.\n\n“Due to the sensitivity surrounding the composition and conduct of the raid, and concern for the personal security of the service members involved, at this time the department cannot comment on any individual recognition,” said Navy Lt. Jackie Pau, a Navy spokeswoman.\n\nBenghazi\n\nThe most tersely worded citation accompanied the only other Navy Cross, awarded to a Marine gunnery sergeant. His heroism on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, came amid the chaos and controversy that surrounds the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. A House committee continues to investigate the attack, the U.S. response and the role of Hillary Clinton, then the Secretary of State and now the likely Democratic nominee for president.\n\nIt’s possible, through the citation and congressional reports on Benghazi, to sketch out his actions that night. The citation refers to his actions “in support of Overseas Contingency Operations in Sept. 2012” but does not say where. The Navy has acknowledged that it did award a Navy Cross to the Marine for his actions that night.\n\nA House intelligence committee report on Benghazi refers to a two-person detachment of military personnel and other security personnel who flew from Tripoli that night to rescue Americans. They arrived at the besieged compound, and within 11 minutes were under attack by mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire. The attack killed two and severely wounded two others. The Marine helped treat the wounded, repel attackers and organize the evacuation.\n\nHis “valorous actions, dedication to duty and willingness to place himself in harm’s way for the protection of others was critical to the success of saving numerous United States civilian lives,” the citation says.\n\nRamadi\n\nIn 2006, U.S.troops and al-Qaeda terrorists scratched and clawed in brutal street-by-street fighting in Ramadi, in western Iraq. \"It was pretty intense urban combat,\" Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland recalled in an interview. He commanded a brigade in Ramadi as colonel at the time and now leads the coalition fighting the Islamic States. \"What the SEALs were doing in particular for us was sniper, counter-sniper operations. That was a pretty critical element of our ability to establish, first of all, our combat outposts in the city, and disrupt the enemy counterattacks against them.\"\n\nThe SEALs, MacFarland said, would venture deep behind enemy lines, setting up \"hide sites\" where small teams would await inevitable attacks on the outposts. Setting up a hide site was relatively simple, he said. Getting out, once discovered, often by children sent as scouts, could be deadly.\n\nOn Sept. 29, an insurgent threw a grenade on the roof where Michael Monsoor and two fellow SEALs had set up to protect another unit. Monsoor, who had a clear exit, chose instead to leap on the grenade, sacrificing his life for those of his colleagues, according to the citation for the Medal of Honor awarded to him posthumously. The lieutenant, who fought through “heavy enemy fire” to retrieve Monsoor and his wounded SEALs, was awarded a Silver Star in secret for the mission.\n\nIn all, from spring to fall in 2006, SEALs earned at least 14 Silver Stars.\n\nMonsoor earned one of those as well, according to his Medal of Honor citation. On May 9, he “exposed himself to heavy enemy fire” to help rescue another SEAL who had been shot in the leg, according to the citation. Monsoor kept firing at insurgents while he and another SEAL dragged their wounded comrade to safety. They loaded him on a Humvee and returned to the fight.\n\nHis fellow SEAL, Chris Kyle, no doubt fired fewer rounds. But the secret Silver Star citation that belongs to him shows that in Ramadi from April 24 to Aug. 27, 2006, “he personally accounted for 91 confirmed enemy fighters killed and dozens more probably killed or wounded.”\n\n\"Chris Kyle, among them, racked up some pretty heavy-duty numbers there,\" MacFarland said.\n\nThe citation refers to Ramadi as the “epicenter of al Qaeda and insurgent activity in Iraq,” and Kyle’s “heroic actions, professionalism and incredible sniper skills” in seizing key areas of the city.\n\nOver the summer of 2006, he was credited with saving the lives of U.S. and Iraqi troops with his rifle through “enemy rocket-propelled grenade and mortar teams eliminated, five enemy snipers with scoped weapons eliminated, and dozens of insurgent fighters destroyed.” Kyle was portrayed by actor Bradley Cooper in American Sniper, the 2014 movie based on his autobiography. Kyle was killed in 2013 by a veteran he had been mentoring at a shooting range in Texas.\n\n\"I lost about 100 soldiers, marines and SEALs in a nine-month period and hundreds more wounded, close to 600,\" MacFarland said. Heroism had become so commonplace, he said, that he had grown numb to it over 15 months of fighting. \"I would tell you one of my biggest regrets as a brigade commander is that I didn’t push harder for more valor citations for my marines and soldiers,\" he said.\n\nHostage rescue\n\nIn February, President Obama awarded another SEAL, Senior Chief Petty Officer Edward Byers, the Medal of Honor for his acts of courage in shielding an American doctor from his Taliban captors while bullets zipped through the hideout. It was a rare public acknowledgement of SEALs' heroism, made even more unusual in that Byers belonged to SEAL Team 6, the legendary unit that killed bin Laden.\n\nThe details of the night of Dec. 8, 2012, were sketched out in the citation for Byers: Taliban gunmen cut down the lead SEAL in the team that assaulted the compound, Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas Checque, mortally wounding him. Byers followed Checque, tackled one of Dr. Dilip Joseph's captors and held another with his bare hands, allowing another SEAL to kill the militant. Byers then leaped atop Joseph to protect him from gunfire.\n\n\"Given the nature of Ed’s service, there is a lot that we cannot say today,\" Obama said at the White House ceremony. \"Many of the operational details of his mission remain classified. Many of his teammates cannot be mentioned.\"\n\nTheir names remain secret, but the citations reveal that three teammates of Byers and Cheque received Silver Stars for their \"bold initiative, undaunted courage, and complete dedication to duty.\"\n\nDramatic Taliban hostage rescue earns Navy SEAL the Medal of Honor\n\nThe first SEAL, the leader of the assault team, killed several of Joseph's captors, including the man Byers held with his hands, according to the citation. After the firefight ended, the SEAL organized medical evacuation for his wounded teammate, secured a landing zone and escorted Joseph to the helicopter.\n\nRealizing Joseph might soon be killed, the second SEAL charged into the compound amid gunfire. \"Displaying calm tactical prowess under fire, he immediately moved down his wall and engaged an armed enemy combatant, while calling out to the hostage.\" His help of Byers in protecting Joseph was \"pivotal\" to the rescue.\n\nThe third SEAL burst into the compound under fire and dragged out Checque for emergency first aid. He bounded back and cut down the last of Joseph's captors who was pointing a gun at Byers and the hostage. The citation credits him with saving Joseph's life and those of his teammates.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/01/30/chita-rivera-dies-west-side-story-broadway-tony-award/72411091007/", "title": "Chita Rivera dead: 'West Side Story,' Broadway star was 91", "text": "Mark Kennedy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK — Chita Rivera, the dynamic dancer, singer and actress who garnered 10 Tony nominations, winning twice, in a long Broadway career that forged a path for Latina artists and shrugged off a near-fatal car accident, died Tuesday. She was 91.\n\nRivera's death was announced by her daughter, Lisa Mordente, who said she died in New York after a brief illness.\n\nRivera first gained wide notice in 1957 as Anita in the original production of \"West Side Story\" and was still dancing on Broadway with her trademark energy a half-century later in 2015's \"The Visit.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn’t moving or telling a story to you or singing a song,\" she told The Associated Press then. \"That's the spirit of my life, and I'm really so lucky to be able to do what I love, even at this time in my life.\"\n\nFrom 2013:Chita Rivera at 80 is 'still living my life'\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2024\n\nIn August 2009, Rivera was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the U.S. can give a civilian. Rivera put her hand over her heart and shook her head in wonderment as President Barack Obama presented the medal. In 2013, she was the marshal at the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.\n\nRivera rose from chorus girl to star, collaborating along the way with many of Broadway’s greatest talents, including Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael Kidd, Harold Prince, Jack Cole, Peter Gennaro and John Kander and Fred Ebb.\n\nShe rebounded from a car accident in 1988 that crushed her right leg and became an indefatigable star on the road. She was on Broadway in a raucous production of \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" in 2012 and the chilly \"The Visit\" in 2014, earning another best actress Tony nomination.\n\n\"She can’t rehearse except for full-out,\" said playwright Terrence McNally in 2005. \"She can’t perform except for full-out, no matter what the size of the house. She’s going to be there 101% for that audience.\"\n\nShe won Tonys for \"The Rink\" in 1984 and \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" in 1993. When accepting a Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2018, she said \"I wouldn’t trade my life in the theater for anything, because theater is life.\"\n\nShe was nominated for the award seven other times, for \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" which opened in 1960; \"Chicago,\" 1975; \"Bring Back Birdie,\" 1981; \"Merlin,\" 1983; \"Jerry’s Girls,\" 1985; \"Nine,\" 2003; and \"Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life,\" 2005.\n\n\"I don’t think we have enough original musicals,” she told The Associated Press in 2012. “I know I’m being old fashioned, but the theater is the place where music, lyrics, words, scenery and stories come together. And I’ve been blessed enough to have done several shows when they really did. They take you places and they’re daring. That’s what we need.\"\n\nHer albums include 16 tracks pulled from her original cast recordings and put out as part of Sony’s Legends of Broadway series and two solo CDs — \"And Now I Sing\" for a tiny record label in the 1960s and \"And Now I Swing\" in 2009 for Yellow Sound Label.\n\nIn the 1993 musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" Rivera played the title role, a glamorous movie star at the center of the fantasy life of an inmate in a South American prison. The story, from a novel by Manuel Puig, had already been made into an Oscar-winning 1985 movie.\n\nIn his review, then-Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara wrote that Rivera \"is more than a musical theater star. She’s a force of nature — which is exactly what is needed for the role of the Spider Woman. With her Louise Brooks haircut, brassy voice and lithe dancer’s body, Rivera dominates the stage whenever she appears.\"\n\nIn 1975, she originated the role of Velma Kelly (to Gwen Verdon’s Roxie Hart) in the original Broadway production of \"Chicago.\" Rivera had a small role in the 2002 film version, while Catherine Zeta-Jones won the best supporting actress Oscar as Velma — just as Rita Moreno had picked up an Oscar for her portrayal of Anita in \"West Side Story.\"\n\nThe songwriters for \"Chicago,\" Kander and Ebb, also wrote Rivera’s first Tony-winning performance, for \"The Rink.\" In winning the Tony for best actress in a musical, Rivera topped the show’s top star, Liza Minnelli, who also had been nominated. The two played a mother and daughter who struggle to rebuild their relationship after a long estrangement; the setting is an old-fashioned roller rink that has seen better days.\n\n\"Spider Woman\" had been her first Broadway show since 1986, when she suffered a broken leg in the traffic accident while she was appearing in “Jerry's Girls,” a Broadway tribute to the songs of Jerry Herman.\n\nAt the Tony awards a few weeks later, she flashed her cast and belted out \"Put on a Happy Face\" from the musical “Bye, Bye, Birdie.”\n\nIt took months of physical therapy to bring back her dancing skills. She told The Associated Press: \"It never entered my mind that I wouldn’t dance again. Never. I can’t explain to you why. It’s hard work getting back but that’s what I’m doing.\"\n\n“My spirit is still there.”\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, the Broadway songwriter and performer, featured Rivera in a scene in his 2021 film adaptation of “Tick, Tick... Boom,” and in a statement said having her included \"remains one of the all-time joys of my life.”\n\nDolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero was born Jan. 23, 1933, in Washington, D.C. Her Puerto Rican father, Pedro del Rivero, was a musician who played in the United States Navy Band, who died when she was 7. Her mother was Scottish and Italian descent.\n\nShe took dance classes and then entered the prestigious School of American Ballet in New York. Her first theater gig, at age 17, was in the touring company of \"Call Me Madam.\" That led to chorus stints in such shows as “Guys and Dolls” and “Can-Can.”\n\nIn her 2023 memoir, “Chita: A Memoir,” another woman steals scene after scene: her self-proclaimed alter ego, Dolores. Unapologetic and fiery, Dolores was the unfiltered version of Chita and served as motivation in times of self-doubt. In one chapter, Rivera writes that she doesn’t read reviews “or Dolores just might invest in a dozen voodoo dolls.”\n\n“I consist of — and I think we all do — I consist of two people: Dolores and Conchita,” Rivera sain in an interview with the AP that year. “Conchita, she’s the one that has been taking all the glory, you know. She’s been doing all the shows, but Dolores is the one that’s pushed her into it. And she’s been keeping me on track, so I listen to Dolores. I listen to her. She’s growing in my head now as we speak.”\n\nAmong other early appearances on the New York stage were roles in “The Shoestring Revue,” 1955; a 1955 musical version of “Seventh Heaven” starring Ricardo Montalban; and “Mr. Wonderful,” a 1956 show starring Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n“I can’t believe that I’ve been given the gift to look back and relive my life,” she told The Associated Press shortly before “The Dancer’s Life” opened on Broadway in late 2005. “It’s about how anybody can do it — if you really believe it, you have the good fortune, you do all the right things and you really work hard.”\n\nRivera, who had a relationship with the now-deceased Davis, married fellow “West Side Story” performer Tony Mordente in 1957. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Lisa Mordente, also became a performer who occasionally appeared on Broadway, garnering a Tony nomination in 1982 for “Marlowe.”\n\nAmong those honoring Rivera on social media were actor Jason Alexander, who said “she set the bar in every way,” and actor and dancer Debbie Allen, who wrote: “I will miss touching you, but I will forever hear your laughter and hold that baton of power you tossed my way.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/07/biden-medal-of-freedom-denzel-washington-simone-biles/7820818001/", "title": "Denzel Washington, Simone Biles: Who is getting Medal of Freedom?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden presented the Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest honor – to 17 people Thursday, including actor Denzel Washington, gymnast Simone Biles and former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\n\nThe president also presented the award posthumously to Sen.

But I did tell him how serious I was about making this movie. And he should just know that whatever fears he had about Hollywood, to just put them aside and trust me. That I was going to do everything I could to tell this story.\"\n\nSoon after that phone call, Kyle and a companion were shot and killed on Feb. 2, 2013, at a shooting range in Texas. A troubled Marine veteran is now on trial for his murder.\n\nBut Cooper has continued to make good on his promise to Kyle, bringing American Sniper to the screen with Clint Eastwood as director. Cooper is deep in post-production with Eastwood and the film is slotted for a limited Christmas Day release, opening wider on Jan. 16 .\n\nCooper felt like he was on a mission to complete the vow for the sake of Kyle, his family and all veterans.\n\n\"I had to do right by him and his family, there was really no choice,\" says Cooper. \"You're sitting across the dining-room table talking to this person's father and mother. And his children and wife are there. And he's passed away. Knowing that they are putting all of their stories in your hands and the responsibly of that, it's actually unique.\"\n\nCooper, 39, transformed himself to play the 38-year-old Kyle, putting on 40 pounds through a rigorous diet and workout regimen. He also trained with Navy SEALs who worked with Kyle, including Kevin \"Dauber\" Lacz, Kyle's sniper partner during his last two tours. Lacz served as a technical adviser and portrays himself in the movie.\n\nBut even clearing houses with actual SEAL teams and live-ammo shooting with the three types of rifles Kyle used in the field didn't prepare Cooper for staring into the rifle scope for the first time onset.\n\n\"Even though it was actors through the scope, they were human beings. It was a whole other deal. I remember getting a chill through my body realizing what he had to do,\" says Cooper of the man who was credited with 160 confirmed kills in his military service.\n\nCooper is clear that Sniper is more than a war movie. \"It's a character study of this man,\" who took an honorary discharge after four tours of duty in Iraq to put together his family life. A big focus is Kyle's relationship with his wife Taya Renae Kyle (Sienna Miller).\n\nScreenwriter Jason Hall says one pivotal scene shows just how Kyle reconnected with his wife and was on the road to acclimating to his civilian life before it was cut short.\n\n\"There is an heroic sense of completion to his story. He was a man who fought like hell for nearly a decade of war, then had to fight equally hard to get home,\" says Hall. \"I found this struggle to be beautiful and complete.\"\n\nCooper says any talk of awards potential is secondary to telling Kyle's story correctly.\n\n\"If Chris' family loves this movie and the people who have gone through the experience can relate to it, and people are moved by the humanity, that's all I care about,\" says Cooper. \"His life merits this.

But doctors did not bring baby Jacquetta straight to her mom. “I guess they were trying to prepare me for what she looked like,” Johnson told CNN.\n\nJohnson was 18 and seemingly healthy, married to her high school sweetheart. But Jacquetta was born with severe abnormalities – a small right eye that didn’t open, a contracted right hand and such a severe cleft palate that she could not breathe on her own, Johnson recalled recently from her home in Raleigh.\n\nThe couple knew their baby would not live long. One day in the car, Johnson was playing with her seven-week-old daughter’s hair when the little girl stopped breathing.\n\nThey took her to the emergency room where medics struggled to save her, then asked the young couple what they wanted to do.\n\n“I looked at my husband and he just dropped his head, not knowing what to say. And so, I looked up at the doctor and I said just … just let her go.”\n\nAnn Johnson lost her child just seven weeks after birth. CNN\n\nJohnson’s dad was a Marine master gunnery sergeant. She’d lived with him on Camp Lejeune for a couple of years. She went to school there. Met her future husband, who also became a Marine, there. And it was there that she unknowingly drank and bathed in poisoned water.\n\nJacquetta’s death, Johnson says, put a huge strain on the couple’s marriage and eventually they separated. “My ex-husband went on to remarry and have a couple of more children. And there was nothing wrong with them,” she says. “So, then I started thinking about Jacquetta … It had to be me.” Crying, she added: “I thought that for all these years.”\n\nJohnson is now one of the thousands of people – Marines and their kin and civilian employees – filing claims against the government for what they say the water they drank and bathed in on the base did to them. We now know that the water at Camp Lejeune was contaminated for years by an off-base dry cleaner, leaky storage tanks and chemical dumping.\n\nAn act of Congress signed by President Joe Biden in the summer opened the door for anyone who spent more than 30 days on base between the years 1953 and 1987 and who has suffered health complications since, to file a civil claim. No doubt you have seen the commercials on TV: lawyers offering to help for a slice of the compensation.\n\n“Every Marine Corps member that enlisted east of the Mississippi during that time period may have come in contact with this water,” says Andrew Van Arsdale, an attorney based in San Diego who is now representing thousands of claimants. “And what does that mean in terms of damages? I mean, you’ve got a million people potentially, sick, (with a) life-ending, life-altering illness. I mean, it’s off the charts.”\n\nGreg Sexton has also filed a claim.

Kidney cancer is one of the diseases now potentially linked to the chemicals in the water on the base, the Department of Veterans Affairs says. He needed surgery, and cancer spread to his lungs.\n\n“It was an emotional, tough thing to go through as a teenager,” he said from his home in Phoenix, Arizona. “I had never really been in love or had a steady girlfriend or anything like that. I was just a kid … You start thinking, ‘Oh, man, I’m never gonna have this in my life?’”\n\nSexton said he is interested more in action than money.\n\n“The Marines need to come forward and acknowledge what happened and make it right to all those people,” he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Marine Corps declined to comment when contacted by CNN for this story. They sent a statement that reads in part: “We care deeply about our service members, veterans, civilian workforce, and families – including those who have experienced health issues they believe are related to their time in service.”\n\nNo help yet\n\nVan Arsdale surveyed his roughly 6,000 clients to ask what rank they were when they came in contact with the water at Camp Lejeune. A majority replied. And, he says, 96.3% said they were enlisted. 3.7% said they were officers.\n\n“(In) certain areas, water super contaminated. (In) other areas, it wasn’t,” he said. “The Marine Corps barracks, right? The bachelor barracks, that was in the areas where the water was tainted.”\n\nIn this May 9, 2007, file photo, a sign is posted at an ongoing cleanup pump and treatment center operated by Shaw Corp. on lot 203 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to treat the underground plume of TCE, trichloroethylene, created by a waste disposal site on the Marine base. Gerry Broome/AP\n\nBut large areas of the base used by officers and the enlisted and their families were affected by the polluted water, and South Carolina lawyer Edward Bell told CNN he knows many officers who were affected.\n\nHe is also representing claimants. “I have had the best of dealings with the Department of Justice,” he said. “Everyone’s trying to get organized to do right by these people.”\n\nBut Van Arsdale says he has filed thousands of claims on behalf of clients since August, and not a single one has been settled yet.\n\nIf a claim isn’t adjudicated within six months, then the claimant can file a lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina. That will make it take even longer to get redress and increase legal costs.\n\n“We’re gonna end up litigating these issues in terms of money damages in front of jurors in the Eastern District of North Carolina for years to come unfortunately,” says Van Arsdale.\n\nThe US Navy, which is overseeing the compensation, concedes no money has yet been paid out.\n\n“The Navy’s Admiralty & Claims Division already is fully operational,” said Patricia Babb, a spokesperson for the Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps, which is handling the claims. “Processing begins upon claim receipt; the initial step includes in-processing and initial evaluation. Currently, the Navy is primarily focused on this step. At this stage, no claims are fully adjudicated.”\n\nDecades of trouble\n\nThe problems with the water used at Camp Lejeune have long been known by military officials. In October 1980, William Neal Jr., chief of laboratory services for the US Army Environmental Hygiene Agency, wrote, “Water is highly contaminated” on a surveillance report form. In March 1981, after repeated follow-up tests, Neal warned, “Water highly contaminated with other chlorinated hydrocarbons (solvents)!”\n\nThe Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says trichloroethylene, one of the major contaminants found on the base, was measured at 1,400 parts per billion in drinking water in May 1982. That is 280 times the maximum level now recommended in the United States by the EPA.\n\nThis photo shows some of the older base housing in the Midway Park neighborhood at Camp Lejeune. Gerry Broome/AP\n\nPCE, a dry-cleaning solvent, was measured at 215 parts per billion in February 1985 in Tarawa Terrace, an area that houses enlisted men and their families. That is 43 times the current level recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. Only then, in 1985, were the most polluted water wells on base closed by the Marines.\n\nThe base commander at the time sent a letter to residents of the area that read in part, “Two of the wells that supply Tarawa Terrace have had to be taken offline because minute (trace) amounts of several organic chemicals have been detected in the water.” There was no mass health warning. Apparently, that didn’t come until 14 years later, after the Marine Corps began attempting to contact former residents of the base for an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry survey to investigate if residents had suffered medical issues.\n\n“I mean, one of the big things about cancers: if you can detect it early enough, you can, you can make it not as bad, right?” said Van Arsdale, the lawyer. “That is a failure of epic proportion and it’s nice to be at this point where we’re finally seeing some accountability for it.”\n\nGreg Sexton says every doctor visit makes him worry about the return of his childhood cancer. CNN\n\nPotential victims, their lawyers, activists, and politicians have applied pressure for years to get to the point where Marines and their families could finally file for compensation.\n\nIt cannot take away all the concern about the effects of that summer in 1977 for Sexton. “There’s always that doubt when you go to the doctor and they take that X-ray, what are they gonna find?” he said of lingering fears that his cancer could return.\n\nBut for Johnson, it could give her an answer – that her baby’s short and painful life was not her fault.\n\n“Everybody’s talking about money and, and financial compensation. Of course, that would be nice,” she says. But what she really wants, what she needs, is “to know that it could have been the water that I consumed,” she says. “And the government could be responsible for what I went through.”", "authors": ["Nick Watt"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/11/11/veterans-group-got-your-6-shatters-hollywood-stereotypes/75512556/", "title": "Veterans group Got Your 6 uses Hollywood to shatter stereotypes", "text": "Matt Alderton\n\nfor USA TODAY\n\nIn a 2013 episode of NBC's \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" actor Eion Bailey stars as Frank Patterson, an Iraq War veteran who has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nTitled \"Traumatic Wound,\" the episode follows Patterson as he attempts to recall the sexual assault of a teenage girl at the club where he's a security guard. Pyrotechnics triggered his PTSD on the night of the assault, causing him to suppress the memory. Patterson initially is a suspect, but after his memory returns, he's exonerated — saving the day by testifying against the actual assailants in court.\n\nThe character portrayal is typical of veterans: In films and on TV, they almost exclusively are either villains who do bad things because of PTSD or heroes who do good things in spite of it. In the course of one 60-minute episode, Patterson is both.\n\nSuch black-and-white portraits make Army veteran Rob Gordon cringe. That's why he helped establish Got Your 6, a coalition of partners working to bridge the gap between veterans and civilians by promoting accurate portrayals of veterans in media and entertainment.\n\n\"Because it reaches millions of people of all ages across the country, we believe that the entertainment industry plays a vital role in America by shaping perceptions that can then shape and affect behavior,\" says Gordon, president of Be The Change Inc., the nonprofit organization that created Got Your 6. \"We want to get across that our veterans are not broken heroes, but rather civic assets. The entertainment industry can help to great effect to get that done.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nIn 2011, Got Your 6 — \"I've got your back\" in military slang — convened major Hollywood studios, networks, talent agencies and guilds for a yearlong discussion of veterans' issues.\n\nFilm and TV producer and director Charlie Ebersol was inspired to help the coalition launch a new signature program: 6 Certified. The program recognizes and rewards films and TV shows that contain a \"representative and balanced\" depiction of veterans.\n\n\"Veterans are highly trained men and women whose experience and education we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in, and yet Americans when polled … think of them as being either heroes or victims,\" says Ebersol, whose firm, The Company, is executive producer of USA Network's \"NFL Characters Unite\" and co-producer of CNBC's \"The Profit.\" \"When you think about it, that's the most ludicrous, bipolar description of soldiers.\"\n\nEbersol had seen programs like \"Will & Grace\" and NBC's \"TODAY\" change public perception of homosexuality and cancer screening, respectively, by normalizing gay characters and colonoscopies. He hypothesized that Hollywood could similarly shape public perception of veterans and change negative stereotypes.\n\n\"There were 22 million people watching \"Will & Grace\" at the height of that show,\" Ebersol continues. \"What else has that kind of reach?\"\n\nSo far, Got Your 6 has certified six projects — the films \"American Sniper\" and \"Amira & Sam;\" Season 20 of \"Dancing with the Stars\" (the spring 2015 edition featured disabled Army vet Noah Galloway, who came in third); and episodes of the TV shows \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"The Night Shift\" and \"Modern Family.\"\n\nEach completed one of the following six actions to become certified: pre-production research with veterans, portraying a veteran character, casting a veteran actor, hiring a veteran writer, telling a veteran story and using veterans as consultants on set or in writers' rooms. Certified projects receive formal recognition, as well as public relations and marketing support within the veteran community.\n\nEd O'Neill's character in \"Modern Family,\" Jay Pritchett, is characteristic of the bunch.\n\n\"The fact that he's a (Navy) veteran enhances his character,\" Ebersol says of Pritchett, who is portrayed not only as a veteran, but also a father, husband and business owner. \"He's got a sense of duty and honor that the military bestowed on him, but it's not his defining characteristic.\"\n\nSeeing more characters like Jay Pritchett — and fewer like Frank Patterson — will make Americans more likely to support veterans like him, says Army veteran Spencer Kympton, president of The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps veterans find post-military purpose by leveraging their skills in community service projects.\n\n\"The more of those stories we can tell, the more effective we as veterans' service organizations can be.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/10/25/hunter-killer-we-took-exclusive-dive-real-navy-submarine/1756270002/", "title": "'Hunter Killer': We took an exclusive dive on a real Navy submarine", "text": "SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF SAN DIEGO – “Prepare to dive,” the officer of the deck barks into the USS Annapolis' PA system.\n\nIt's game-face time.\n\nOn a sunny San Diego morning, the training exercise has embarked on calm seas off Naval Base Point Loma, where the nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine is stationed. But it's all serious for the officers and crew onboard, who are intently watching digital navigational screens throughout the control room.\n\nSubmerging on a submarine, particularly one capable of carrying torpedoes and 12 Tomahawk land-attack missiles, is a vulnerable time that requires unwavering vigilance.\n\nTwo periscope operators scan the 360-degree water surface, spinning in a perfectly synchronized dance mere feet apart, somehow avoiding collision, as the officer in charge of the ship's movement gives commands to the sonar operators in a separate room.\n\n\n\n“Dive! Dive!” the chief of the watch orders, sounding two blasts of the diving alarm before switching open the ship’s main ballast tank vents to let seawater in. The 6,900-ton war machine slips beneath the choppy surface and glides underwater effortlessly.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nEven behind his facial stubble, “Hunter Killer” director Donovan Marsh cannot hide an amazed smile as a rare civilian (along with a USA TODAY reporter) witnessing a highly classified nuclear submarine in full operation. Unlike his first visit on a fast-attack sub before filming began, Marsh is now able to breathe easier knowing that his nuclear submarine thriller starring Gerard Butler is completed and headed to theaters on Friday.\n\nHe acknowledges being slightly overwhelmed when he observed a sub at work before starting \"Hunter Killer.\"\n\n“I can remember watching all this and just thinking, ‘How am I going to bring this to the screen and do justice to the complexity of the way the submarine works?’ And knowing that I could not build an entire submarine. There was a lot of anxiety,” he says. “This war machine is an awesome, and frightening, scene to behold. It’s just an incredible piece of technology.”\n\nThe high-tech underwater world is the uncredited star of “Hunter Killer,” with Butler playing Captain Joe Glass, who takes his deep-diving sub – built to hunt and destroy enemy vessels – beneath the Arctic Circle to thwart a destabilizing Russian military coup.\n\nIt's pure popcorn Hollywood fiction, but it's based on the novel “Firing Point,” written by George Wallace, retired commander of the nuclear attack submarine USS Houston, and Don Keith.\n\nMarsh knew he would need to create a realistic environment within the film. Before starting production, Butler (the actor, a producer on the film, wasn't able to make the latest sub excursion) and Marsh spent three days observing and bunking on the USS Houston. There were moments of pure exhilaration, such as bidding a long farewell to the base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from the ship's open-air bridge with celebratory cigars.\n\n“That’s the first thing you experience on a sub, three hours just watching as you leave the port,” says Butler, speaking later by phone. “That feeling is incredibly powerful, unforgettable and exciting.”\n\nBut the work trip, during which Marsh slept in berthing quarters with the crew, persuaded the director that he needed to place the film’s entire set on a massive hydraulic gimbal to capture realistic movement – and that more Navy help was needed to tell the story.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense granted Marsh two days aboard another nuclear sub to shoot scenes with actual submariners to be worked into the fictional dramatic footage, showing the crew performing fire drills and being rousted from crowded bunks. A stand-in for Butler was filmed dramatically sliding down the ship's ladder past “millions of pipes and wires.\"\n\n\"It’s such a great shot,\" says Marsh, who marvels at the intricate inner workings crammed into a few hundred feet of HY-80 steel. \"But it would have been impossible to build all of this for one shot.”\n\nMarsh attached cameras to the ship's sides to film the vessel submerging and used the base’s “wet-trainer” room, where sailors get hands-on damage-control experience, to shoot scenes of lethal flooding. The dramatic capper was capturing a submarine making an “emergency blow,” or dramatic rise to the surface.\n\nThat shot was tricky. One take only, and Marsh, in a helicopter, wasn't given the coordinates of the rising sub. That was \"classified.\"\n\n“Luckily, it came up just in the corner of the shot and we caught it,\" he says.\n\nEven for civilians on the Annapolis day trip, the “classified” aspect looms large on a vessel with the nation's top military technology. Mobile phones and cameras are collected (photographs are provided by the Navy after official clearance to make sure no secrets are given away). Minders are present at all times, and the nuclear reactor section is absolutely off limits. Questions as simple as speed or distance traveled are answered with a polite \"That's classified.\"\n\nBut Marsh is granted a full tour of the ship (minus the nuclear reactor), from the torpedo room (where he pulls the trigger on a torpedo tube filled with water) to the 90-square-foot food galley (which maximizes all space impressively to feed the 137-man crew).\n\nThe food is a major perk, with lobster and steak dinners and pizza nights as celebrated high points. It's key for morale in a tightly confined sub that's capable of staying underwater for 90 days.\n\n“And the captain eats just like any other seaman. It signifies that we are all in this together,” says visiting Capt. Christopher Cavanaugh, commodore of Submarine Squadron 11, during the tour.\n\nThe Navy received no payment for the \"Hunter Killer\" filming, and officials stress there’s no cost to the taxpayer, as the film crew joins active drills and exercises already underway. But shooting a movie like \"Hunter Killer\" is a big public relations boon, portraying the drama and potential excitement of the undersea world.\n\n“They desperately need people to join the submarine crew, and being in this kind of enclosed space is not to everyone’s taste,” Marsh says. “Putting this onscreen can be seen as a recruitment tool.”\n\nNavy officials encouraged Marsh's decision to add a female crewmember aboard \"Hunter Killer\": Women have been allowed in the fighting force only since 2010, and there are no female crewmembers on the Annapolis. \"It's the future and a great addition to the film,\" Marsh says.\n\nThe director is treated to a hamburger lunch in the wardroom, the traditional officers' mess, on a table that would serve as a surgery platform in an underwater emergency. \"Silent service\" signs on the doors remind that they should be closed quietly to avoid vibrations that could be detected by enemy sonar.\n\nAfter burgers and vanilla ice cream, Marsh is granted the ship’s honorary pin by the submarine's commander John C. Witte, who tells him, “Thank you for what you’ve done. And I can’t wait to see the movie.”\n\nAs the Annapolis comes to surface for its return to base, Marsh takes in the final scenery from the bridge. Incongruously, a pod of dolphins appears along the crashing wake of the ship's starboard side. They jump happily in the air alongside the war machine.\n\nThe director gets contemplative about the world he's about to reveal in theaters.\n\n\"One day these men are going to go out there and maybe die. That’s what kind of keeps coming back to me. But you also think, what an incredible experience. And an honor to depict these people even in a make-believe world.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/21/lone-survivor-moral-dilemma-cuffs-time-release/4659609/", "title": "'Lone Survivor' debacle could be avoided with a gadget", "text": "Gregg Zoroya\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSmall device attached to flexible cuffs can automatically release captives after a period of hours\n\nNavy SEALs can restrain captives long enough to reach a safe area\n\nCommandos gave prototypes good reviews%2C but military did not purchase more\n\nThe vote was at 10,000 feet in the Hindu Kush mountains of eastern Afghanistan.\n\nFour Navy SEALs had to decide whether to execute or spare three Afghan goat herders — one of them a teenage boy — who stumbled into their covert mission in the summer of 2005.\n\nThe moral dilemma ended with the herders freed, mission compromised and three of the SEALs killed, along with 16 other U.S. rescuers in the ensuing battle. The raw debate about the right thing to do when lives are at stake lies at the heart of one of the most popular films now showing, Lone Survivor.\n\n\"No night passes when I don't wake up in a cold sweat thinking of those moments on that mountain,\" writes former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, whose book about what happened inspired the movie starring Mark Wahlberg. \"I'll never get over it. I cannot get over it. The deciding vote was mine, and it will haunt me till they rest me in an East Texas grave.\"\n\nBut what if the Navy SEALs, or any U.S. commandos wrestling with the same ethical choice, never have to make it — all because of a simple, mechanical device just a shade smaller than an old cellphone at a cost of a few hundred dollars?\n\nThat tool has since been invented by a former Navy captain and SEAL who was the command surgeon for U.S. Special Operations Command and was emotionally shaken by the battle dramatized in Lone Survivor that claimed so many of his brethren.\n\nThe only problem now is getting the U.S. military to buy it.\n\nFrank Butler, the former Navy captain, and Bill Rusher, a friend and business partner, formed a small company that built 200 prototypes of the device in 2011.\n\nU.S. special operations teams have since given it good reviews and asked for more. But the U.S. Special Operations Command has not ordered any additional devices.\n\n\"They never did the second part of our contract. They said they just didn't have the money at the time,\" says Rusher, of Charleston, S.C. \"It's sort of like beating your head against the wall getting it deployed.\"\n\nKen McGraw, U.S Special Forces Command spokesman, says the device was never ordered in bulk because none of the elite units within the command from the Army, Navy, Marines or Air Force \"submitted a written requirement\" for it or anything like it.\n\nThe timer-activated gadget is designed to sever flexible, plastic cuffs used to restrain an accidental witness, but only hours after special operations forces like Navy SEALs have been able to get safely out of a dangerous area.\n\nThat's what went wrong in the Lone Survivor episode.\n\nThe four-man team was on a covert mission to locate and observe a militia leader involved in attacks on U.S. troops. Nearly two hours after releasing the goat herders, the four SEALs were crouched in trees along the side of a mountain when they caught sight of the ridgeline above.\n\n\"Lined up along the top were between 80 and a hundred heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK-47 pointing downward,\" Luttrell writes. \"I cursed those (expletive) goatherd(er)s to hell, and myself for not executing them.\"\n\nThe Taliban closed in, killed three members of the team and shot down a rescue helicopter carrying 16 other Army and Navy special operations troops. It was at the time the greatest loss for America's elite forces, superseded only by the shoot-down of a U.S. Chinook helicopter in 2011 that left 30 Americans — including 25 special operations troops — and eight Afghans dead.\n\nLuttrell survived and was harbored by rural Afghans who alerted U.S. forces. The slain members of his team were Lt. Michael Murphy, 29, who Luttrell said voted with him to spare the goat herders; Matthew Axelson, 29, who argued they should be killed to keep the Taliban from finding the team; and Danny Dietz, 25, who abstained.\n\nMurphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for exposing himself to enemy fire during the battle in order to get a clear signal on his transmitter phone and call in their position. At one point, according to a Navy citation, he was shot in the back, dropped the transmitter, picked it up and continued providing coordinates.\n\nEven before the battle in the mountains, Butler says, he had been thinking that simple technology could save teams from having to face such a moral crisis.\n\n\"Rather than having to choose between killing the goat herders or letting them go, the SEALs could have restrained the goat herders with flex cuffs, set the timer (on the device he later invented), and left,\" Butler says.\n\nOn the company website and in power-point or white papers about his device, Butler says there have been at least four prior occasions when U.S. or British commando units had missions compromised by unwitting bystanders.\n\nThere is scant information about most of them — a Navy SEAL mission in Grenada in 1983 that failed because of an \"unplanned encounter with a local person;\" a U.S. special operations action during the Persian Gulf War stopped by an \"unplanned encounter with an Iraqi,\" and a compromised mission during the most recent Iraq War.\n\nOne that did garner attention involved an eight-man team of British special operations soldiers whose reconnaissance mission in Iraq was accidentally jeopardized during the 1991 Gulf War. One was killed in action, two died of hypothermia during efforts to flee, and four were captured by the Iraqi military and later released.\n\nThey were also initially spotted by a goat herder, in this case an Iraqi boy.\n\n\"Do we top (shoot) him?\" wrote the mission commander, Andy McNab, in his book about the event titled Bravo Two Zero, which also later became a movie. \"I wouldn't want that on my conscience for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMcGraw, the Special Operations Command spokesman, says historians at the headquarters could not recall any other missions that had been compromised in a way similar to the Lone Survivor incident.\n\n\"That doesn't mean one or more didn't take place,\" McGraw says.\n\nBut it was the Bravo Two Zero story that got Butler thinking about a way to solve the problem. The Lone Survivor battle in 2005 that left so many dead convinced him something had to be done, he said.\n\nThese circumstances \"don't happen very often, but can be disastrous when they do. ... Shouldn't we give them better options to deal with such scenarios in the future?\" he says.\n\nShortly after his retirement from the Navy in 2006, he and Rusher formed a small company called Time Cuffs. They developed, patented and began producing 200 of the time-activated devices.\n\nThe 3-inch-long device is threaded onto plastic flexible cuffs used to bind a person's feet or hands. A timer that can be set for up to eight hours sets off a firing cap, driving a piston that cuts the plastic cuffs, Rusher says.\n\nThere is even a recorded voice that in the two dialects of Afghanistan, Pashto and Dari, will assure the restrained person that his or her predicament is only temporary.\n\nMcGraw says initial development of what is officially known as STARRS, for Special Timer Activated Restraint and Release System, was a joint project funded in 2009 by Special Forces Command and the military's Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office. He says 200 prototypes were produced and distributed to commando groups.\n\nRusher says there was one option to build 1,000 to 2,000 more of the devices — a number high enough to keep the per-unit cost under $200 each. But it never happened.\n\nDocuments that Rusher shared show good reviews for the product from commandos using the prototypes. Others have asked for them, but no more are available, he says.\n\n\"It is always a challenge to change cultures,\" Butler says. \"But as the country mourns the loss of our finest warriors (in Lone Survivor) and honors their sacrifices, it should also be asking how we can prevent another such tragedy.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/21"}]}

'Christmas Wrapping,' The Waitresses\n\nOtherwise best known for their New Wave hit, “I Know What Boys Like,” The Waitresses dropped this dose of awesome storytelling in 1981.\n\n9. 'Do You Hear What I Hear,' Whitney Houston\n\nThat soaring voice and that impeccable delivery that always sounded effortless equate to a worthy keepsake of Houston’s potency.\n\n10. 'Wonderful Christmastime,' Paul McCartney\n\nFilled with a sprightly chorus and a typically melodic bass line, this solo hit recorded during McCartney’s sessions for his “McCartney II” album exemplifies his own consistent cheer.\n\n11. 'Celebrate Me Home,' Kenny Loggins\n\nA song for any season, really, with its sentiment of longing to be somewhere familiar.\n\n12. 'Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town,' Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\n\nThis sinewy rock version was recorded by the band in 1975 at a show in New York and remains a live favorite.\n\n13. 'Grown-Up Christmas List,' Natalie Cole\n\nWritten by David Foster and Linda Thompson-Jenner, the sweet ballad is a vital gut check every holiday season.\n\n14. 'Same Old Lang Syne,' Dan Fogelberg\n\nIf you don’t melt at Fogelberg’s delicately rendered line, “as I turned to make my way back home, the snow … turned into rain,” then we’re very sorry, you are not in possession of a heart. The Backstreet Boys also offer an impressively thoughtful version of the ballad on their new \"A Very Backstreet Christmas\" album.\n\n15. 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,' The Jackson 5\n\nThe darling vocals of Michael Jackson and his brothers and the unfettered glee in the 1970 arrangement are undiminished.\n\n16. 'Santa Baby,' Eartha Kitt\n\nConsidered controversial in 1953. Let that sink in.\n\n17. 'Happy Xmas (War Is Over),' John Lennon, Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band\n\nAn anti-war song that is devoid of typical holiday sentimentality, the swooping anthem has nonetheless become an annual necessity.\n\n18. 'Do They Know It’s Christmas,' Band Aid\n\nOft-maligned now, but there can be no denying the incredible feat Bob Geldof executed to corral some of the U.K.’s finest – from Bono to Bowie, Duran Duran to George Michael – all in the name of charity.\n\n19. 'Step Into Christmas,' Elton John\n\nUnabashedly cheerful and bright, the single found on John's \"Diamonds\" collection celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.\n\n20. 'Gloria (Angels We Have Heard on High),' Michael W. Smith\n\nAn underrated maestro whose piano and synthesizer compositions are consistently emotional and triumphant.\n\n21. 'White Christmas,' Bing Crosby\n\nThe Irving Berlin standard, written for the 1942 film “Holiday Inn,” won an Academy Award for best original song at the 15th annual ceremony.\n\n22. 'Winter Wonderland,' Jason Mraz\n\nIt might not be the most popular version of the jaunty 1934 song (that honor goes to Perry Como and later, Eurythmics). But Mraz’s unique vocal stylings are the most memorable.\n\n23. 'The Twelve Days of Christmas,' John Denver and The Muppets\n\nThe endearing folkie’s vocal quirks are appealing enough, but add in the contributions of Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy and Kermit and resistance is futile.\n\n24. 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' Gene Autry\n\nA singalong directed at children, yet who among us hasn’t gotten swept up in that chorus?\n\n25. 'I'll Be Home for Christmas,' Josh Groban\n\nWritten as a tribute to soldiers overseas who yearn to be with their families at Christmas, the original by Bing Crosby is the standard-bearer. But Groban admirably communicates the song’s deep poignancy.\n\n26. 'Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,' Brenda Lee\n\nRecorded when Lee was only 13, the 1958 staple is still a regular on the Billboard charts and peaked at No. 2 in 2020.\n\n27. 'Holly Jolly Christmas,' Burl Ives\n\nBeloved for its inclusion in “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” the Johnny Marks-penned singalong was delivered by Ives, who also voices the film’s narrator.\n\n28. 'We Need a Little Christmas,' Angela Lansbury\n\nLong prior to becoming the “Murder, She Wrote” maven, the late Lansbury flourished as a Broadway star, including playing the title role in 1966’s “Mame,” which spawned this Jerry Herman gem.\n\n29. 'My Favorite Things,' Tony Bennett\n\nThe distinctive phrasing that colors every Bennett offering is particularly welcome on a song that is too often reduced to a recitation.\n\n30. 'Christmas All Over Again,' Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\n\nCoated with Petty’s inimitable nasal tones, the Phil Spector-ish bop arrived on 1992’s “A Very Special Christmas 2.”\n\n31. 'Someday at Christmas,' Stevie Wonder\n\nThe first Christmas album from the R&B/soul icon produced this gem in 1967. Wonder reentered the charts with it in 2015 following a duet update with Andra Day.\n\n32. 'Sleigh Ride,' The Carpenters\n\nKaren and Richard Carpenter’s 1978 “Christmas Portrait” album is a flawless entry in the holiday canon, but their gliding take on the 1948 wintry jaunt is a standout.\n\n33. 'Silver Bells,' Michael Bublé with Naturally 7\n\nA smooth Christmas classic requires an equally glistening vocal delivery and the combination of Bublé and a capella standouts Naturally 7 perfectly collide.\n\n34. 'Merry Xmas Everybody,' Slade\n\nReleased at the peak of the British glam rockers’ popularity in 1973, the bouncy guitar rocker showcases the quartet in their shambolic glory.\n\n35. 'Christmas Time Is Here,' Vince Guaraldi Trio\n\nForever associated with “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” the instrumental composition by jazz pianist Guaraldi also produced a lyric version.\n\n36. 'Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays,' NSYNC\n\nReleased a little more than a year after their breakthrough debut, the group’s 1998 seasonal collection seized the momentum and spotlighted the charisma of the winsome fivesome.\n\n37. 'Feliz Navidad,' José Feliciano\n\nIt’s more than 50 years old, but the straightforward guitar strummer that turned a simple Spanish Christmas greeting into worldwide familiarity still charms.\n\n38. 'Christmas in Sarajevo,' Trans-Siberian Orchestra\n\nBetween the screaming guitars and layered synthesizers, it’s pure musical drama – and the swagger never gets tiresome.\n\n39. 'Blue Christmas,' Heart\n\nWe know Elvis made it famous. Ann and Nancy Wilson did it better.\n\n40. 'This Christmas,' Donny Hathaway\n\nIt barely caused a ripple when released in 1970, but following an Atco Records rerelease in 1991, the song has surged on various Billboard charts and inspired numerous covers.\n\n41. 'Little Saint Nick,' Beach Boys\n\nMelding the group’s trademark harmonies with their affinity for hot rods (or, in this case, Santa and his sleigh), the 1963 original doesn’t allow winter to impede the Boys’ sunny melodies.\n\n42. 'Christmas Time,' Bryan Adams\n\nThere’s nothing particularly deep about Adams’ 1985 foot-stomper (“There’s something about Christmas time/ Something about Christmas time” goes the refrain). But enduring popularity led to a video release in 2019.\n\n43. 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,' Annie Lennox\n\nThe crystalline voice of the Eurythmics’ veteran is the ideal match for the traditional English carol.\n\n44. 'Like It’s Christmas,' The Jonas Brothers\n\nThe sibling trio followed their 2019 resurgence (“Happiness Begins”) with this buoyant bauble.\n\n45. 'Christmas Tree Farm,' Taylor Swift\n\nWho better to sing about the delights of a Christmas tree farm than a woman who actually grew up on one?\n\n46. 'Christmas Is the Time to Say I Love You,' Billy Squier\n\nThe Boston guitar rocker slapped this on as the B-side to his early '80s hit “My Kinda Lover” and ensured massive video rotation by enlisting MTV’s VJs for the accompanying clip.\n\n47. 'This Gift,' 98 Degrees\n\nCapitalizing on their peak popularity in 1999, the quartet of Nick Lachey, Jeff Timmons, Drew Lachey and Justin Jeffre turned to swoony Christmas tunes for their third album.\n\n48. 'Mele Kalikimaka,' Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters\n\nThe song’s title comes from the Hawaiian phrase meaning “Merry Christmas”; this version is one of the earliest recorded, in 1950.\n\n49. 'Run Rudolph Run,' Sheryl Crow\n\nAn entry in the 2001 fifth edition of the popular “A Very Special Christmas” compilations (which benefit the Special Olympics), the oft-recorded song popularized by Chuck Berry rollicks under Crow.\n\n50. 'That’s Christmas to Me,' Pentatonix\n\nThe title track of the a capella group’s third studio album solidified their standing as a Christmas playlist necessity.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/01"}]}

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday to combat bird flu, which has spread to more than a quarter of all the state's dairies in the last month and infected 34 state residents.\n\nThe emergency declaration expands the amount of money Newsom can spend fighting the H5N1 virus, which was first detected in California cows in August, and has swept across the nation’s largest dairy-producing state. As of Monday, 649 dairies have had infections, including 313 in the last 30 days and about 120 just in a week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.\n\nAll human infections reported so far had been mild until Wednesday when federal officials said a Louisiana resident hospitalized with a presumptive bird flu infection has the first U.S. case classified as \"severe.\"\n\nThe person had been exposed to sick and dead birds suspected of being infected with H5N1, the Louisiana health department said last week. It is the same flu strain that sickened a teen in Canada, but not the one that has infected cattle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe exact cause of the spread among California cattle isn't clear, said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, which represents most California dairy farmers. Movement of cattle is thought to have first led to the spread, though later, shared milking equipment and personnel likely drove the infections. Testing has dramatically increased to detect outbreaks earlier, too.\n\nWhat's known is the virus has substantial effects on the cows that produce tens of thousands of gallons of milk each year, the farmworkers who care for the livestock, and farmers trying to keep businesses afloat.\n\n“You do not want this on your herd,” Raudabaugh said. “It’s that bad.”\n\nConsumers shouldn’t see impacts to pasteurized milk, cheese, or yogurt at their grocery stores, said Raudabaugh. The pasteurization process destroys the virus’s ability to live or replicate, making pasteurized milk safe.\n\nHowever, raw milk has been shown to contain the virus. Two raw milk producers in California have had to recall products due to virus present in unpasteurized milk, including one product announced Saturday.\n\nThere have now been 61 confirmed human cases of bird flu in the U.S. during 2024, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat happens to dairies affected by bird flu\n\nOver the long term, Raudabaugh worries about farms' ability to recoup losses in milk production when cows recover.\n\nCalifornia has approximately 1,100 dairies, mostly concentrated in the state's fertile Central Valley, that produce approximately 41 billion gallons of milk annually for an economic value of nearly $20 billion as of 2018, according to a 2019 University of California, Davis, analysis for the California Milk Advisory Board.\n\nBird flu was first detected in Texas dairies in the spring after officials believe one herd was infected by wild birds. So far, 16 states have had outbreaks in cows, with 865 herds affected. Three-quarters of infected herds come from California.\n\nIn California, outbreaks in dairies started in and around Tulare County, before moving up and down the Central Valley and now trekking northward, Raudabaugh said.\n\nWhat does a state of emergency do?\n\nCalifornia’s declaration opens up more funding to respond to the crisis, similar to a natural disaster like a forest fire.\n\nThe proclamation by Newsom, a Democrat, allows the state to streamline and expedite resources to address the rapid spread of bird flu across the state, his office said in a news release.\n\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement. “Building on California's testing and monitoring system ‒ the largest in the nation ‒ we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information.”\n\nOver the summer, Colorado experienced large bird flu outbreaks among poultry and cattle that led to several outbreaks among livestock workers. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, issued a disaster declaration then to help poultry farms.\n\nWhat happens to cows and other animals when they catch bird flu\n\nThe H5N1 virus typically doesn't kill cows the way it does birds and chickens. Estimates have placed mortality rates in cows at no more than 2%.\n\nOnce cows are sick, their digestion process of ruminating stops, they stop drinking water, and they develop a fever, Raudabaugh said. In triple-digit Central Valley temperatures, this may have resulted in some cows dying from heat stress in a hot October. The cool fall and winter months in California have meant fewer cows are getting severely ill and dying, she said.\n\nBefore cows develop these symptoms, their milk shows signs of the virus, Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, an organization representing veterinarians who treat cows, previously told USA TODAY. Bulk milk testing can help detect bird flu circulating in herds before large outbreaks occur.\n\nAfter a fever breaks, cows resume eating, drinking and ruminating. The milk production then returns over several weeks, but it still levels out about 20% to 30% less than before a bird flu infection, said Dr. Michael Payne, a researcher and outreach coordinator at the Western Institute of Food Safety and Security, a center within the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nCats have also gotten sick with bird flu circulating in cows. When officials first identified bird flu in Texas cows, they did so, in part, from dead cats that likely drank raw milk in barns. Last week, Los Angeles County health officials identified two indoor cats that died from suspected bird flu infections after they drank recalled raw milk.\n\nWhat happens to people with bird flu\n\nSo far, most people infected with bird flu in the U.S. have had mild infections. The risk to the general public remains low, though livestock workers are at heightened risk, officials have said.\n\nOf the 61 identified people infected with bird flu across the U.S., more than half have been in California, CDC data shows.\n\nOnly one of the U.S. cases, a child in the San Francisco Bay Area, has had no connection to a dairy or poultry farm. State officials said the child had only mild symptoms of cold and flu.\n\nThe state’s 33 remaining cases have been in dairy workers. Their symptoms have typically been limited to eye redness and mild respiratory symptoms, and they soon recovered.\n\nOfficials and experts worry about the potential for the virus to mix with the seasonal flu, which could lead it to become more transmissible or severe. The CDC has sought to vaccinate livestock workers against seasonal flu to prevent this.\n\nWhy isn't more being done to contain bird flu?\n\nDespite quarantines of farms, outbreaks continue to occur, which suggests other routes of transmission, Payne, of UC Davis, said in an email.\n\nThese may include potential spread from wildlife such as rodents or birds living on or near farms. Additionally, flying insects and even dust plumes in the wind may are being studied, Payne said. \"As a whole, we still have a lot more to learn about the multiple ways the (bird flu) virus is being spread through our domestic species,\" he said.\n\nIn December, the USDA announced it would begin bulk testing of milk supplies to track the virus.\n\nGiven the rapid spread in California dairies, Raudabaugh said the U.S. needs to pursue a vaccine development “Operation Warp Speed” for cows, on par with the one during the Trump administration that rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines for people.\n\nBird flu “has been so catastrophic for our herds,” Raudabaugh said. “We have to do something really drastic in order to prevent this. Relying on herd immunity is not a good strategy.”\n\nOn Oct. 24, the Department of Health and Human Services announced USDA had started safety trials for vaccines in cows. While research into the vaccines is promising, it's still early, USDA told USA TODAY over email.\n\nFor people, the federal government has stockpiled 10 million doses of vaccine that it believes will be effective against the current strain of bird flu, though because of the mildness of illnesses so far and lack of human-to-human spread, it has not yet made the shots available to farmworkers or the general public.\n\n\"We can’t get either cattle or human vaccines on the market fast enough,\" Payne said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/21/iowa-bird-flu-outbreak/26113911/", "title": "5.3M hens to be destroyed after bird flu outbreak", "text": "Donnelle Eller\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES — About 5.3 million laying hens in northwest Iowa will be destroyed after tests confirmed a second outbreak of avian influenza in the state, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday.\n\nIt's the largest operation in the nation to be hit with the virus since December, federal documents show. The commercial egg-laying facility, located in Osceola County, Iowa, more than doubles the number of birds destroyed in the country because of the disease.\n\n\"It's one of the bigger farms in the state,\" said Bill Northey, Iowa's secretary of agriculture. \"But when there's an outbreak like this, you have to make sure the disease doesn't leave.\"\n\nBecause of avian influenza, the state's $2 billion commercial egg-laying industry has been on high alert this spring. Iowa, the nation's largest egg producer, has about 50 million hens and supplies nearly 1 in every 5 eggs consumed in the United States.\n\n\"Anybody that has a poultry operation — whether large or small, whether you've got hundreds of birds or one bird — this should be a wake-up call,\" said Randy Olson, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association.\n\nDespite its virulent nature, officials say, the virus doesn't pose a danger to humans or to the food supply.\n\nLast week, H5N2 avian influenza was discovered in a flock of 27,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County, Iowa. Those birds also were euthanized to contain the spread.\n\nBefore Monday's announcement, more than 2.6 million birds had been killed by the disease or by authorities working to prevent it from spreading.\n\nThe virus is capable of killing an entire flock within 48 hours.\n\nThe names of the Iowa operators or their locations haven't been released. Olson said the family-owned operation in Osceola County provided liquid eggs for use in baked goods.\n\nTHE VIRUS' SPREAD\n\nScientists and government officials believe the virus is being spread through migratory birds in the Mississippi flyway, where the strain previously has been identified. The birds are believed to transmit the illness through their droppings.\n\nThe disease has been discovered at more than 50 sites across the country in several states, including Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nThe turkey industry has been hit the hardest, with 2.4 million birds destroyed.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has declared a state of emergency over the bird flu outbreak and authorized the state's National Guard to help contain the disease. Avian influenza virus has been detected in three Wisconsin poultry flocks, affecting tens of thousands of chickens and turkeys, Walker's office said.\n\nFederal and state health officials consider the risk to people to be low from these infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry. No human infections with the virus have ever been detected.\n\n\"Facilities have been very concerned about biosecurity,\" limiting deliveries and other access to facilities, Northey said. \"We're hopeful these remain isolated cases. But there's no good way to know what will happen.\"\n\nMARKET IMPACT LIMITED\n\nWhile the outbreak is crushing for the producer, it's expected to have a limited effect on the egg market, say Iowa State University economists.\n\nWhile the United States has seen itself shut out of some markets in the past when an outbreak occurs, so far most major buyers of American eggs have decided to keep buying products from unaffected areas, rather than shutting out the entire country, said Dermot Hayes, an Iowa State University agribusiness economist.\n\n\"I don't see this as being a big deal at this point,\" said Hayes.\n\nDavid Swenson, another Iowa State University economist, said Osceola County posted total agricultural sales of $163.5 million in 2013, with poultry and egg production accounting for only 4% of that figure.\n\nStill, the loss of 5.3 million hens is \"a big deal for that producer and a big deal for however that operation is configured,\" said Swenson. \"But poultry production up in that county is a small fraction of total agricultural output.\"\n\nThe federal government is expected to help producers with part of the losses from the disease.\n\nHayes expressed concern that despite all the biosecurity measures put in place in recent years in agriculture, it was a \"surprise\" that migratory birds \"somehow managed to contaminate\" the facility.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/07/16/bird-flu-outbreak-colorado-update/74427629007/", "title": "Bird flu outbreak among Colorado poultry workers doubles US cases", "text": "Triple-digit temperatures, industrial fans and carts used to kill millions of sick chickens with gas may have caused the largest bird flu outbreak among U.S. workers to date, federal health officials said.\n\nA commercial egg-laying facility in northeast Colorado now has four workers confirmed infected with bird flu and another presumed to have contracted the virus, pending test results. The sickened Colorado workers, announced over the weekend, doubled the number of human cases in the U.S. since agricultural workers began contracting bird flu this year, first from dairy cows.\n\nWorkers at the poultry farm in Weld County had been in the process of killing 1.8 million chickens, some of which were infected with the dangerous H5N1 influenza, to prevent it from spreading, federal officials said in a briefing with reporters Tuesday.\n\nTheir goggles or N95 face masks apparently slipped as industrial fans blew feathers and other infected items through the sweltering barn, exposing them to the virus, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe workers all suffered some combination of fever, chills, coughing and eye infections, Shah said. They were given the antiviral Tamiflu, and none required hospitalization.\n\nThe virus' risk to the general public remains low, Shah said. The workers' illnesses were relatively mild, he said, and Tamiflu remains effective. Also, the genetic sequence of the virus has not changed substantially since December as the virus moved from Texas to a dozen other states, including Colorado ‒ and from birds to cows and then, apparently, back to chickens, as well as people.\n\n\"We've not seen severe illness, which is reassuring,\" Shah said. \"The other thing we look at, in addition to severity is whether the virus is able to transmit from animals to humans and/or from humans to humans with greater ease or with greater efficiency. We haven't seen changes, particularly on the human-to-human side.\"\n\nThe unfolding route of transmission\n\nOfficials said they don't know for sure how the H5N1 virus arrived at the Weld County poultry farm. In early July, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster emergency after the outbreak at the facility, the largest flock of chickens affected in the state and among the largest across the U.S.\n\nDays earlier, a dairy worker, also in northeastern Colorado, contracted bird flu, the state’s first case, while working with infected cows.\n\nCattle in the same region of Colorado had been known to be infected with the specific variant of the virus, so it's likely, though not yet confirmed, that the virus was passed from cattle to chickens, said Dr. Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s H5N1 Response.\n\n\"Poultry are very susceptible and easily infected,\" Deeble said on the call with reporters. \"It does not take much in order to introduce this into a flock.\"\n\nOnce any poultry on a farm are infected with H5N1, the only way to contain the virus is to kill the entire flock, the USDA has said. Killing all 1.8 million chickens could take up to two weeks, Deeble said.\n\nSweltering barns, feathers flying\n\nAbout 160 workers inside barns at the facility were tasked with pulling out chickens, placing several at a time in a cart that would then be filled with carbon dioxide, killing them in less than a minute and a half, Dr. Julie Gauthier, the USDA's executive director for field operations in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said on the call.\n\nTemperatures in northeast Colorado have hit 104 degrees, though Shah said temperatures inside the barns were even hotter. Workers wore light paper protective suits over their clothes, N95 respirators, goggles, boots and gloves. Industrial fans pushed air through the barns.\n\nThe fans made it uncomfortable to wear PPE, all while feathers ‒ a means in which bird flu virus can spread ‒ blew around. That probably caused the infections in five workers, officials said.\n\nThat suggests risks can be better controlled in the future with more systematic use of PPE, in addition to measures to improve ventilation, Shah said. A 10-person CDC team, which includes bilingual speakers and an industrial hygienist, arrived Saturday in Colorado to monitor and test workers and suggest safety improvements.\n\nIn total, 60 workers were tested for bird flu, and 55 tested negative, though many had symptoms consistent with other respiratory illnesses like rhinovirus, Shah said.\n\nSixteen workers who are symptomatic had been tested Monday, AnneMarie Harper, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email. Testing is still being done, and Shah said more infections might come to light.\n\nWhat preparedness looks like\n\nPart of the virus found on its surface remained unchanged from the first person infected in Texas to the first infected in Michigan and the workers sickened recently in Colorado, Shah said, suggesting the virus has not mutated to become more worrisome.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response is pushing ahead with production of millions of bird flu vaccine doses through July as part of a pre-pandemic stockpile, said David Boucher, director of the agency's infectious disease preparedness and response.\n\nThere is no recommendation yet for people to receive the vaccine, which has not been fully tested or approved for use.\n\nThe agency also distributed 5,000 goggles, 300,000 gloves, 150,000 N95 masks and 528 courses of Tamiflu to Colorado, Boucher said.\n\n\"This is what preparedness looks like,\" Shah said. \"It's making sure they have adequate stocks and supplies in the event that they may need them rather than trying to scurry and scramble at the last minute to acquire them.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/10/04/emergency-bird-flu-vaccines-stockpile-h5n1-infection/75511111007/", "title": "US to double bird flu vaccine stockpile as H5N1 infections rise", "text": "Federal officials plan to double the stockpile of emergency bird flu vaccines as they identify more people infected with the disease.\n\nThree manufacturers were awarded $72 million to increase pandemic preparedness including against avian influenza, officials announced in a Friday morning briefing.\n\nThe funding is expected to bring the country's stockpile to 10 million doses by next spring, according to David Boucher, an infectious disease preparedness director at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. prepared the first 4.8 million doses this summer, though officials have not used them.\n\nOfficials this year have identified 16 people infected with H5N1 avian influenza. All have had mild symptoms. There has been no human-to-human spread of the virus. If that happened, public health authorities would likely change their assessment about putting the vaccines to use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasized that despite the human cases, the risk to the general public remains low.\n\nThe latest $72 million in funding will be awarded to three companies: CSL Seqirus, which produced the first round of doses, and to Sanofi and GSK. The three companies would fill and finish doses of influenza vaccines from bulk storage into ready-to-use vials or pre-filled syringes to ensure the vaccines are ready for distribution if needed. The companies will also manufacture the components for vaccines against circulating influenza strains, and Sanofi plans to keep a stable egg supply on hand for future production of the egg-based vaccine.\n\nAs more herds infected, more dairy workers getting sick\n\nThe new funding was announced after officials identified two new bird flu cases in California dairy workers on Thursday. Several dairy herds in the state have been infected since officials first identified the virus circulating among cows in August. Federal officials said 56 herds were infected as of Thursday.\n\nThe two workers at separate Central Valley farms had been in contact with infected animals. Both developed eye redness, a common symptom among people infected this year. Six of the country’s 16 bird flu cases have been among dairy workers, and nine were poultry workers in Colorado.\n\nOn Saturday, the California Department of Public Health said a third person is suspected of contracting bird flu pending CDC specimen testing. All three cases involve people in contact with infected cows at different Central Valley dairy farms. None of the people infected have been hospitalized.\n\n“As there are more herds that test positive, there are more workers who are exposed,” Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at CDC, told reporters. “And when there are more workers who are exposed, the chances of human infection increase.”\n\nAnother person was recently infected in Missouri with no known source of transmission. The CDC is testing blood samples for nearby contacts, including several health workers and another person in the same household. Those results are forthcoming.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC is distributing seasonal flu vaccines – which don’t prevent bird flu infection – to farm workers, Shah said. The goal is to reduce the risk of seasonal flu among workers who are at greater risk of catching bird flu from sick livestock. They fear that cross-reaction of bird flu and seasonal flu in the body may cause bird flu to mutate to spread easier or cause more serious disease.\n\nQuarantine, test milk for bird flu\n\nDr. Eric Deeble, a senior official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said California officials have quarantined dairy farms where cattle are infected. They have also established 10-km zones around farms that have had infections to test milk in these areas for traces of H5N1.\n\nBulk milk sampling has been the primary way for officials to detect virus in herds, Deeble said, referencing reductions of spread on Colorado farms.\n\nAfter Colorado herds began getting infected, he explained, officials found a significant number of infections across the state. By mandating bulk milk testing, officials tracked down and isolated the spread of the virus.

All had regular contact with dairy cows. As of July, more than 130 herds across 12 states have seen infected cows.\n\nMore:Be 'alert but not alarmed' about bird flu, CDC official urges.\n\nThe HHS award to the American vaccine manufacturer will go toward developing an mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine. Moderna’s candidate for the vaccine draws from mRNA technology used successfully during the COVID-19 response, resulting in one of the first Food and Drug Administration-authorized COVID-19 vaccines ultimately licensed by the FDA, HHS said.\n\nVaccines from mRNA can complement traditional vaccine technologies during a pandemic influenza emergency response. This is a concern with H5N1 avian influenza, even if the current risk to human health remains low.\n\n“We have successfully taken lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and used them to better prepare for future public health crises,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “As part of that, we continue to develop new vaccines and other tools to help address influenza and bolster our pandemic response capabilities.”\n\nThe funding, made through the federal Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle, allows Moderna to enhance vaccine response capability, an HHS news release said. This includes using large-scale commercial mRNA manufacturing and ongoing seasonal flu vaccine development. HHS secured a fair pricing agreement to ensure cost savings access to vaccines.\n\nModerna will prepare materials and conduct clinical trials to collect safety and immune response data to support FDA approval and, eventually, potentially scale response with commercial production in a public health emergency.\n\nThe award also enables rapid development of mRNA vaccine targeted to various influenza virus subtypes, or strains, with pandemic potential. Development and manufacturing can pivot quickly, if needed to address other emerging infectious diseases, HHS said.\n\nAvian influenza timeline:From chickens to foxes, here's how bird flu is spreading across the US\n\nIf successfully developed, Moderna’s mRNA-based pandemic flu vaccine could improve response times if a new virus strain emerges. HHS pointed to the swine flu pandemic in 2009.\n\nIn 2023, the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of HHS, requested proposals from Moderna and other companies to develop mRNA vaccines for potential public health emergencies caused by influenza viruses, including H5N1.\n\nIn a news release, Moderna said it initiated a study to look at vaccine safety and immunogenicity for pandemic influenza in people 18 and older. This included vaccine candidates against H5 and H7 bird flu viruses. Results are expected in 2024 to inform further study development plans, Moderna said.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been four human cases of bird flu, including three in 2024. Health officials said the risk to the general population remains low, although dairy workers and others working near infected cows face heightened risk.\n\nBeyond the announcement for Moderna, federal health officials have already begun emergency preparedness against bird flu.\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), within HHS, already has 4.8 million doses of bird flu vaccine being poured into vials that could be used pending FDA approval, Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary of ASPR, said in a call with reporters Tuesday morning. Those first doses could be ready by mid-July through August.\n\nStill, vaccines may not be the best solution to address bird flu should the outbreak spread further into humans, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOther options to contain bird flu may be used, particularly if more farm workers get sick. These could include widespread use of antivirals to fight the virus, for example. No decision has been made on what the best response is, Shah added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/06/03/michigan-cow-herds-infected-bird-flu/73955332007/", "title": "Michigan has most cow herds, people infected with bird flu in US", "text": "Kristen Jordan Shamus\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nMichigan has become ground zero for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus that's sweeping the nation, killing turkeys, chickens and wild birds, infecting cows and other mammals – and now has sickened a third U.S. farmworker.\n\nThe Great Lakes state has more dairy cattle herds known to be infected with avian influenza than any other state in the U.S., with 24 outbreaks in 10 counties as of Friday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections – transmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.\n\nTexas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states – Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina – also have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.\n\nThe reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.\n\n\"The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance,\" Monto said. \"Other states need to do the same. ... It's being missed.\"\n\nThe CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.\n\nThat means only five people tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus \"is certainly more widespread\" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said.\n\n\"The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that,\" said Monto. \"If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place ... it's going to spread even more.\"\n\nThe CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.\n\nThe agency said it is also stepping up national surveillance/testing by:\n\nAsking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus.\n\nExtending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it’s ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.\n\nIncreasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.\n\nHow the virus came to Michigan cow herds\n\nThe outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle – with spillover to humans – began in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n\"We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement,\" Boring said, \"and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then.\"\n\nCalling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an \"extraordinary emergency,\" Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nAmong the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, and establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.\n\nMore:Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be next\n\nThe order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.\n\nThe state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said.\n\n\"In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level,\" he told the Free Press on Friday. \"Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such.\"\n\nStill, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads.\n\n\"We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm. ... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like.\"\n\nHuman cases so far have been mild\n\nAll three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.\n\nThe Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.\n\nThere is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.\n\nThe more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or cause more severe disease.\n\n\"That's why we really need to control it – not because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad,\" Monto said.\n\nThe CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.\n\nAll three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.\n\nIn samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.\n\nAnd that's key, Monto said.\n\n\"We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily,\" Monto said, \"because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases.\"\n\nThe virus affects animals, people differently\n\nThe impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"The virus behaves different in each species,\" said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. \"There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice,\" while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.\n\nThe current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.\n\nDairy cows get sick from the virus but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.\n\nLast week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice – even though the mice were not lactating.\n\n\"In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year,\" Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. \"It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening.\"\n\nMore:Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to human\n\nFor humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003 to 2023 caused severe illness and deaths.\n\n\"In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing,\" Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nCould respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?\n\nFor now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost.\n\n\"The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission,\" he told the Free Press last week — before the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.\n\nJoe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows.\n\n\"Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas,\" Coyle said.\n\n\"It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure.\"\n\nThe CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.\n\nMore outreach to farms needed\n\nDr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak.\n\n\"Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts,\" he said.\n\n\"I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of.\n\n\"In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested.\"\n\nMany farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care.\n\n\"A lot of these populations are hard to reach,\" Lauring said. \"I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program.\"\n\nMichigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.\n\nTesting is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing.\n\n\"This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that,\" Lauring said. \"Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak.\"\n\n'We're flying blind'\n\nKatelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, \"Your Local Epidemiologist,\" that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled.\n\n\"We are flying blind,\" she said. \"We don’t know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it’s becoming better at infecting humans.\"\n\nLack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts.\n\n\"It shouldn’t be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1,\" she wrote.\n\nAnimal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.\n\nIf an animal's test result is positive, \"we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there,\" he said.\n\nThat includes ensuring personal protective gear – such as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots – are available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well.\n\n\"We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases – eye protection, gloves – that is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already.\"\n\nNeither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had \"direct exposure to an infected cow.\"\n\n\"This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms,\" she said.\n\nFor protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:\n\nSafety goggles or a face shield\n\nDisposable gloves\n\nBoots or boot covers\n\nA respirator, such as an N95 mask\n\nFluid-resistant coveralls\n\nHead covering\n\nMany questions about avian influenza remain unanswered\n\nThere remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.\n\nAmong them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?\n\n\"What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow,\" said Monto.\n\nHe noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus.\n\n\"Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus,\" the USDA reported.\n\nAnd though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection.\n\n\"We do know that raw milk is full of the virus,\" Monto said. \"We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk.\"\n\nMonto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals – or humans – is infectious when they contract avian influenza.\n\n\"This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states,\" Monto said.\n\n\"We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected.\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency and released $3.5 million in funding for oversight, testing and safety equipment, federal officials have repeatedly briefed reporters, and workers have once again killed millions of chickens to slow the spread.\n\nBut while state and federal officials react with extreme caution to the virus and its dangerous potential, neighbors seem unconcerned.\n\n\"I know this all affects the farmers but it hasn't affected us,\" said Gail Balcom, 63, as she sat outside the Silver Spur bar, a few miles from one of the affected poultry farms.\n\nMostly, she was grateful that someone else was responsible for killing all those chickens. \"I wouldn't want to do that job,\" she said.\n\nThe outbreak is having a local impact, though. The Southeast Weld County Fair, scheduled to start on Thursday, is switching to an online photo-only poultry competition, to avoid bringing lots of chickens together. State officials are encouraging other county fairs and livestock events to be extra vigilant in showing and mingling cows and other animals.\n\nThe state veterinarian has also restricted the movement of poultry and eggs in large portions of Weld County. Federal officials are also requiring any lactating cow being transported across state lines to be tested for avian flu unless they are headed directly to slaughter.\n\nThe situation echoes a similar outbreak in 2022, but this new strain appears to have infected Weld County poultry flocks after first infecting nearby dairy herds, along with 10 farmworkers. State officials said they don't yet know how it spread between the farms.\n\nRisks to people\n\nSo far, the cows and people have gotten only mildly ill. The current version of the virus slows milk production in cows and gives people respiratory symptoms and/or pink eye.\n\nExperts say the biggest risk is that a person infected with seasonal flu could also catch avian flu, with the two viruses exchanging genetic material and creating something newly terrifying.\n\n\"Bird flus in particular tend to make everybody a little more nervous,\" said Dr. Michelle Barron, UCHealth’s senior medical director of infection prevention and control, and a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. UCHealth serves Colorado, along with parts of Wyoming and Nebraska.\n\n\"Right now, it's pretty mild, but flu viruses in general love to mutate and change,\" Barron added. \"There's no human-to-human spread that we know of, but that's the concern.\"\n\nNone of the sickened farmworkers required hospitalization, officials said. But federal and state experts are closely monitoring, and Polis last month ordered commercial dairies to test milk weekly for signs of the virus.\n\nNeither the federal officials on-site nor state officials would discuss whether this specific chicken farm was affected by the outbreak, with state officials citing a Colorado law banning public dissemination of that information. The farm's owner did not return a request for comment.\n\nColorado has more than 100 dairies and approximately 200,000 dairy cows, the vast majority concentrated in large operations in Weld County, which is also home to numerous poultry farms. The county is also an important migratory bird habitat.\n\nFederal officials say wild birds can carry a mild infection of the virus and pass it on to domesticated chickens and turkeys, where it can be 90% lethal. The infection has also killed bald eagles, foxes, skunks and at least one bear in Colorado. In an Aug. 2 announcement, Colorado state officials said wild birds are not responsible for the current outbreak.\n\nTo help slow the spread, Colorado farmworkers this year have killed 3.5 million farm chickens, in addition to killing more than 6 million birds from 2022 to 2023 during what was then considered the largest foreign animal disease outbreak in state history. Typically, Colorado farms produce about 1.5 billion eggs annually, with about 5 million chickens statewide.\n\nBecause government officials are withholding the specific locations of the outbreaks, it's not possible to judge whether the same farms are being reinfected repeatedly or to examine the economic impact the cullings and closures have on individual workers.\n\nWeld County ‒ physically bigger than the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined ‒ depends heavily on its agricultural production, along with oil and gas extraction.\n\nIn a written statement responding to USA TODAY, state agriculture officials said they are still trying to assess the economic impact of the outbreak. They said workers from 30 farms have been given protective equipment and said testing is available to anyone with symptoms who was exposed to either infected animals or people.\n\nFederal public health experts say the majority of the Colorado farmworkers who got sick were likely infected when their protective gear slipped as they worked in 100-plus degree heat, grabbing and suffocating the chickens by stuffing them, a handful at a time, into enclosures that were then filled with carbon dioxide.\n\nWhy does Colorado have a bird flu problem?\n\nNationally, bird flu infections in cattle have dropped significantly except in Colorado, where about 20 of the infected herds have been detected, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nFederal officials say Colorado might be an outlier because it's testing more often than other states, but also suggest Weld County's \"quirk of history and geography\" may also be playing a role.\n\nWhile Colorado has fewer dairy farms than other big milk-producing states, they're mostly clustered in Weld County, alongside the poultry farms and migratory bird pathways.\n\n\"They are all in very close proximity to one another, and so there is a lot of sharing of equipment, a lot of sharing of personnel and a lot of movement on and off farms to adjacent farms,” Dr. Eric Deeble, the USDA's deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs told reporters on a recent call.\n\nDeeble, a veterinarian, said Colorado should be commended for the cooperation among producers, and state and federal regulators and health experts.\n\n\"As a result, we're seeing a relatively high rate of testing and getting really good answers and really good insight into the pattern of this disease,\" Deeble said.\n\nSilent Colorado chicken farm fumigated\n\nAt the Weld County chicken farm, a handful of workers occasionally crossed the graveled yard among the dozens of long, yellow single-story buildings where chickens are raised and lay eggs.\n\nThe ventilation fans were silent, and buildings bore newly added temporary signs in both English and Spanish, warning they had been fumigated with formaldehyde, a common poultry disinfectant.\n\nThe buildings lack windows so workers can use light to trick the hens into thinking it's always springtime, making them lay more often. A job posting for egg handlers at the farm offers pay of about $20/hour, with bilingual skills encouraged.\n\nBarron, the infection-control expert, said she hopes state and federal officials are working hard to ensure that farm workers and their families are being properly screened for the virus.\n\nClinicians might not test someone with mild respiratory symptoms if they lack direct contact with animals, she said, especially because there are no commercially available tests and everything has to be sent to a state lab. Positive results are then confirmed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nBarron said the COVID-19 pandemic drove home for her the challenges of protecting workers who don't speak English well or who may not be legally employed, which can be the case at farms in Weld County. She said workers at risk of firing or deportation may be reluctant to speak up, especially if they don't feel particularly sick.\n\nPublic health officials must also ensure they are properly explaining to the workers what's going on, she said, such as how cows could be infected with bird flu, or why federal officials are wearing protective garments but farmworkers aren't.\n\n\"They don't ask because they don't want to be in trouble,\" Barron said. \"You think about it differently when you don't have much money or security in that position.\"\n\nIn a statement, state agriculture officials said a bilingual outreach employee has spoken with 46 farmworkers and does not collect personal information from those workers. The state also declined to say whether any farms have refused to participate in the testing and monitoring, other than to say it has received \"good\" compliance.\n\n\"Close coordination and communication between all partners is critical for effective response to complex outbreaks,\" the statement from the Colorado Department of Agriculture said. The department said no one was available for an interview over a week.\n\nOutside the Silver Spur bar, Balcom and her friends chatted as cigarette smoke drifted into the sky. The group said they know several workers from farms with infections, but no one seemed to be talking about it much. They bemoaned the loss of fundraising egg sales for the high school's Future Farmers of America, and worried about what the chicken cull might do to egg prices again.\n\nStill, they said there's little concern around the county.\n\n\"I don’t see anybody glowing or anything like that,\" laughed Katrina Windhorst, 61.

And even when research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security breaches — as more than 100 labs have — federal regulators keep their names secret.\n\nOf particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working with the world's most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs — the two highest levels of containment that have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Yet there is no publicly available list of these labs, and the scope of their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state health departments charged with responding to disease outbreaks. Even the federal government doesn't know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office has warned for years.\n\nA team of reporters who work for the USA TODAY Network of Gannett newspapers and TV stations identified more than 200 of these high-containment lab facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia operated by government agencies, universities and private companies. They're scattered across the country from the heart of New York City to a valley in Montana; from an area near Seattle's Space Needle to just a few blocks from Kansas City's Country Club Plaza restaurant and shopping district.\n\nHigh-profile lab accidents last year with anthrax, Ebola and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the discovery of forgotten vials of deadly smallpox virus at the National Institutes of Health raised widespread concerns about lab safety and security nationwide and whether current oversight is adequate to protect workers and the public. Wednesday the Department of Defense disclosed one of its labs in Utah mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax -- instead of killed specimens – to labs across the USA plus a military base in South Korea where 22 people are now being treated with antibiotics because of their potential exposure to the bioterror pathogen. As many as 18 labs in nine states received the samples, the CDC said Thursday.\n\n\"What the CDC incidents showed us ... is that the very best labs are not perfectly safe,\" says Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology. \"If it can happen there, it certainly can happen anywhere.\"\n\nSome people find little reassurance that nobody was sickened in the CDC accidents or in the historically low numbers of serious infections among lab workers generally, or that infections spreading into communities surrounding labs have been rarer still.\n\n\"Many of us think that's really a matter of good fortune,\" said Beth Willis, who chairs a citizen lab advisory panel in Frederick, Md., home to one of the nation's largest high-containment research campuses at the Army's Fort Detrick.\n\nThe country's best labs have robust safety programs, said Kenneth Berns, co-chair of a panel of outside lab safety advisers currently examining biosafety at CDC and other federal labs. Yet the systemic safety problems identified at the CDC's prestigious labs have raised questions about what's happening elsewhere. \"It's a matter of some concern,\" said Berns, a distinguished professor emeritus of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida.\n\nThe consequences could be devastating if accidents were to occur with lab-created strains of deadly influenza viruses that are purposely engineered to be easier to spread than what's found in nature, said David Relman, a microbiology professor at Stanford University who is a federal adviser on lab safety and a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"You're talking about something that has the ability to take off, and we could not be confident of being able to contain it,\" he said.\n\nRelman said that not enough is known about the state of safety at labs that perform infectious disease research but emphasized that the kinds of labs drawing concern are the same ones the public needs to discover important new treatments and vaccines. \"We have to find some happy blend of minimized risk and enhanced benefit,\" he said.\n\nAt the high-containment labs identified by USA TODAY, experiments are underway involving drug-resistant tuberculosis, exotic strains of flu, the SARS and MERS viruses, plague, anthrax, botulism, ricin and the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, according to interviews and more than 20,000 pages of internal lab safety records and incident reports obtained from labs across the country.\n\nStudies are also being done on a wide range of bioterrorism pathogens that are less known to the public, such as the agents that cause exotic diseases like tularemia, Q fever and melioidosis. Still others are focused on pathogens that pose serious economic risks to agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and \"mad cow\" disease.\n\nAt a few labs, experiments have been done with strains of flu and other viruses purposely made to be more dangerous in studies that seek to understand how they might mutate naturally. White House science advisers called for a temporary halt of that kind of \"gain of function\" research last fall while expert scientific panels spend the next year studying its risks and benefits.\n\nThe research at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs — which use special equipment, negative air pressure and numerous safety and security procedures — seeks to better understand how organisms cause disease and ways to protect against them. It's the kind of work that the public doesn't give much thought to until people with Ebola arrive on planes in the United States from an outbreak in Africa, or the current avian flu outbreak forces farmers to kill millions of chickens raising the specter of higher egg prices.\n\nIt's impossible to obtain a full accounting of lab accidents or lab-acquired infections because there is no universal, mandatory requirement for reporting them and no system to analyze trends to assess emerging biosafety risks and disseminate lessons learned on a regular basis.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program, which inspects and regulates the subset of research labs that experiment with about four dozen types of pathogens deemed to pose bioterror threats, requires labs to report potential exposure or release incidents, as well as thefts or losses of specimens.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2013, labs notified federal regulators of about 1,500 incidents with select agent pathogens and, in more than 800 cases, workers received medical treatment or evaluation, limited public data in program annual reports show. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections and there were three unintended infections of animals, according to the reports, which do not identify labs and mostly provide aggregated counts of incidents by type. Reported incidents involve events ranging from spills to failures of personal protective equipment or mechanical systems to needle sticks and animal bites.\n\nThe program, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, refuses to release copies of detailed incident reports, citing a 2002 bioterrorism law.\n\nIncident records the USA TODAY Network obtained directly from individual labs provide a window on the kinds of mistakes that happen. An animal caretaker in Georgia was potentially exposed to a bird flu virus that kills 60% of the people it infects when a defective respirator hose supplying purified air detached from its coupling in September. A researcher in Wisconsin was quarantined for seven days in 2013 after a needle stick with a version of the same H5N1 influenza virus. A lab worker in Colorado failed to ensure specimens of the deadly bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping them in May 2014 to a co-worker in a lower-level lab who handled them without critical protective gear. None of the workers was infected.\n\nThe public and the lab community tend to learn only about the rare instances of serious or fatal lab infections, which sometimes are published as case reports in scientific journals or make national news.\n\nIn 2009, Malcolm Casadaban, a University of Chicago scientist with an underlying medical condition, died from an infection with a weakened strain of plague bacteria. In 2012, 25-year-old researcher Richard Din died after being infected during vaccine research involving Neisseria meningitides bacteria at a lab inside San Francisco's VA medical center. Both of their deaths involved research in biosafety level 2 labs, where pathogens are considered to be less dangerous than those worked with in high-containment labs.\n\nDin, who became a researcher to cure diseases like the cancer that killed his mother, developed a fever and started feeling dizzy while out to dinner with friends. He had no idea how serious his symptoms were, his friends and family told USA TODAY. By morning, Din was covered in a splotchy rash and could barely talk, recalled Lawrence Tsai, who raced to Din's apartment to help.\n\nTsai carried his friend down two flights of stairs and drove him to the hospital. \"His body was very hard, very straight,\" Tsai said. \"Only his eyes were open. He could not say anything.\"\n\nA few hours later, Din was dead. And Tsai said he and his friends were told they, too, were at risk and needed to take antibiotics because of their close contact with him. The bacteria that killed Din can spread from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. About two dozen emergency room workers also were treated with antibiotics as a precaution, according to a presentation about the case at a scientific conference. Nobody else was sickened.\n\nFederal workplace safety investigators, who investigated because the case involved a death, said Din died because the VA failed to adequately supervise and protect workers in the research lab. Among the \"serious\" issues they cited: Din and other workers in the lab were manipulating specimens of the dangerous bacteria out on tabletops — not inside protective biosafety cabinets that would have reduced potential exposures to droplets or splashes. The lab also failed to train workers about warning signs of infection, violation records show.\n\nAlthough lab-created outbreaks that spread to people or animals in the surrounding community are rare, they have happened.\n\n\"That's what you would worry about,\" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, of the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent think tank that studies biosecurity and epidemics. \"But even then the consequences up to now have been limited to the very close contacts of the person who was infected.\"\n\nA small, deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2004 was traced to lab workers at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. In 2007, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease among cattle in England that required herds to be slaughtered was blamed on leaking drainage pipes at a nearby research complex.\n\nIn Louisiana, tests are underway to make sure a deadly bioterror bacterium hasn't colonized the soil and water around the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans. Late last year, the bacteria got out of one of the center's BSL-3 labs, likely hitching a ride on workers' clothing, sickening two monkeys that lived in outdoor cages and later infecting others. Tulane will spend the next five years testing its outdoor monkey colony as well as wildlife and feral cats around the 500-acre facility to ensure the bacteria haven't contaminated the environment. The CDC and Tulane say they think the bacteria spread only inside the center's buildings, and so far tests outdoors have not detected the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause severe and difficult-to-treat illness in people and animals infected by coming into contact with contaminated soil or water.\n\nOn a global scale, a lab accident is considered by many scientists to be the likely explanation for how an H1N1 flu strain re-emerged in 1977 that was so genetically similar to one that had disappeared before 1957 it looked as if it had been \"preserved\" over the decades. The re-emergence \"was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source,\" according to a 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHowever, most pathogens studied in labs, unlike the flu, don't spread easily from person to person. Often, to become infected a person needs to have direct contact with a pathogen, which is why lab workers are most at risk, experts said. For example, people can become infected with anthrax by inhaling the bacterium's spores, but once sickened they are not contagious, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think the public needs to be too concerned,\" said Marian Downing, president of the American Biological Safety Association. \"There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place.\"\n\nBeyond accidental lab-associated outbreaks, federal auditors consider the deliberate theft and misuse of a deadly pathogen to be one of the most significant risks of biolab research. That's what the FBI says happened in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17. Bruce Ivins, a biologist and anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Md., was the perpetrator, the FBI concluded.\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has issued repeated warnings since 2007 that the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased the aggregate risk of accidental or intentional releases of viruses, bacteria or toxins.\n\nNo single agency tracks the overall number or location of these labs, the GAO has said. Little is known about high-containment labs working with dangerous pathogens such as tuberculosis, the MERS virus and others that aren't on the select agent list and tracked by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nNational standards for constructing and operating these kinds of labs are lacking, which means labs vary by local building requirements. While voluntary guidance exists for safe lab design and operations, the GAO has found it is not universally followed.\n\nThe documents obtained by USA TODAY show power failures at BSL-3 labs at Texas A&M University repeatedly resulted in the labs losing their negative air pressure during 2013, a key safety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. The CDC's labs in Atlanta also have had airflow problems over the years, the newspaper previously reported.\n\n\"The public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have disastrous consequences,\" the GAO's Nancy Kingsbury told Congress at a hearing on the CDC lab incidents last summer.\n\nLab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program — whose departments often fund the research they oversee — would not grant interviews despite repeated requests since last year. The program oversees about 262 organizations that operate BSL-3 and eight organizations that operate BSL-4 labs.\n\nThe two federal agencies that jointly run the program — the CDC and USDA — operate their own labs, which have been involved in recent high-profile incidents.\n\n\"We believe the current system of inspecting/overseeing laboratories is adequate, but we are always open to continued improvements,\" the CDC said in an emailed statement. USDA officials also declined to be interviewed.\n\nLab safety officials at the National Institutes of Health, a major research funding agency that operates its own labs and helps set national biosafety guidelines, also declined interview requests.\n\n\"There is no 'zero-risk' proposition in the conduct of research,\" the agency said in a statement. \"NIH works extremely hard to minimize all research-related risks.\"\n\nMore than 100 labs experimenting with potential bioterror agents have been cited by regulators at the CDC and USDA for serious safety and security failings since 2003, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nYet so much of select agent oversight is cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to assess regulators' effectiveness in ensuring safety. In several instances, troubled labs and even federal regulators appeared to misrepresent the significance of the government's enforcement efforts.\n\nSince 2003, the CDC has referred 79 labs for potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. It has levied fines against 19 of them totaling more than $2.4 million, the CDC said in response to questions.\n\nSome are repeat offenders. Five labs have had \"multiple referrals\" for enforcement actions, the CDC said. Two labs have been kicked out of the program, and five labs have been suspended from doing any select agent research, the agency said.\n\nWhich labs repeatedly failed to address safety problems? The CDC won't name names — not even for the two labs kicked out of the select agent program. The CDC and its regulatory partners at the USDA say the 2002 bioterrorism law requires keeping this information secret.\n\nYet earlier this year, the CDC publicly announced its suspension of the Tulane National Primate Research Center — after the center's accidental release of a bioterror bacterium became publicly known and was the subject of news reports. The CDC said it balances the public's right to transparency with the risk posed by information being made available to those who might use it to threaten public health or security.\n\nCurrently seven labs are under the extra scrutiny of a federal select agent lab performance improvement program, the CDC said. The program is offered as a voluntary alternative to suspension or other regulatory action, the agency said, for labs with a \"repeated failure to correct past observation, biosafety and security concerns\" or failures to comply with extra security requirements for work with \"Tier 1\" select agents. Tier 1 agents are those deemed to pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating economic effects.\n\nWhile under scrutiny of the program, an individual researcher or project must halt the research that has been found in violation, but other select agent research at the institution generally is allowed to continue, the CDC said.\n\nThirty-three labs have been put on performance improvement programs since 2008, CDC said. Their names are secret too.\n\nDozens more labs have faced regulatory actions from the USDA, which takes the lead overseeing select agent labs primarily working with animal or agricultural pathogens. The USDA says it has conducted 48 investigations that have resulted in $116,750 in fines.\n\nThe USDA said all of its enforcement records about these fines are required to be kept secret because of the 2002 bioterrorism law. The USDA did release a spreadsheet it says documents its actions, but the agency redacted almost all the information on it: lab names, violation types and even dates. Only a few references to warning letters and fines were spared the agency's black marker.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program says no law or regulation bars the labs themselves from discussing their select agent research. And universities and other research institutions routinely publish their research on select agent pathogens in scientific journals.\n\nRegistered labs just aren't supposed to share details of specific security measures, such as locations of keys and codes, that would give access to pathogens. The CDC and USDA said there is nothing that prohibits labs from releasing information or answering questions about any regulatory problems they've had. Yet few were willing to readilydiscuss violations or failed inspections.\n\nLabs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa are among those in the federal performance improvement program, at least as of January, records obtained by USA TODAY show. Although the secrecy provisions of the 2002 bioterrorism law apply only to certain federal agencies, officials at the state-run university cited that law among its reasons for denying requests for records about safety violations and the performance improvement program.\n\nThe university inadvertently confirmed that its Honolulu labs had been put in the performance improvement program in records it filed in January with Hawaii's Office of Information Practices, which is deciding USA TODAY's public records appeal. The university wrote that being put on a PIP is something it is \"proud\" of.\n\n\"We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,\" the university wrote to the appeals agency, adding that it \"has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.\"\n\nUniversity of Hawaii officials declined to be interviewed.\n\nLast year, two labs agreed to pay fines handed down by the HHS Office of Inspector General for select agent violations, records show.\n\nA lab that federal officials would describe only as an \"Arizona research university\" agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens they worked with. The lab, the USA TODAY Network's reporting found, was Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Lab director Paul Keim said the issues date back to 2010 when the university had difficulty keeping up with changing federal regulations. Since then the university's labs have passed several inspections, he said.\n\nAn unnamed Florida laboratory agreed to pay $50,000 to resolve violations that included failing to ensure accurate inventories of select agents and failing to notify the CDC and appropriate law enforcement agencies after discovering a missing select agent.\n\nThe inspector general's office, citing regulations stemming from the 2002 bioterrorism law, redacted the names of these labs, as well as all other labs receiving fines, in documents it provided to USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Other labs that have been fined over the years for select agent violations are located in Alabama, California, Missouri, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, records show.\n\nAs a way of providing some oversight, Congress requires a report each year on the number of thefts, losses and releases of bioterror pathogens at labs regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nYet regulators provide scant details of their activities and the problems identified at labs. Usually just three pages long plus a cover page, the reports contain only aggregated counts of lab incidents by type, plus vague information on a few serious incidents.\n\nThe select agent program told Congress it had \"imposed a $425,000 civil money penalty\" on an unnamed lab where a serious biosafety lapse in 2008 had resulted in a cow in a nearby disease-free herd becoming infected with Brucella bacteria, which cause brucellosis.\n\nBrucellosis is a contagious and economically significant agricultural disease — which causes cattle and other livestock to abort their fetuses, produce less milk, suffer weight loss, infertility and lameness. It has been the subject of eradication efforts for decades.\n\nThe $425,000 fine would have been one of the largest in the overall select agent program's history — if it had actually been imposed.\n\nBut it wasn't imposed, USA TODAY's investigation found, and the USDA never corrected the record with Congress.\n\nUSA TODAY was able to identify the Brucella research program at Louisiana State University's AgCenter in Baton Rouge as the likely recipient of the $425,000 fine by examining USDA animal health reports that tallied what states reported brucellosis cases in 2008. Louisiana, which had a case that year, had been declared brucellosis-free in 2000.\n\nLSU officials spent months denying USA TODAY access to its records about the incident, citing among other things select agent regulations unrelated to the requested information. In statements and interviews, LSU downplayed its violations and provided information that was later contradicted by federal records.\n\n\"The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,\" LSU officials said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY.\n\nYet, in December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the incident investigation reports from the USDA and Louisiana's state agriculture department, the documents showed no uncertainty.\n\nUSDA records show that investigators documented serious violations. In levying the $425,000 fine, regulators cited LSU for failing to have adequate biosafety measures, resulting in the release of the bacteria that caused the cow's infection. The USDA also cited LSU for violating regulations by sending Brucella-infected cattle that had been part of select agent vaccine experiments to an unregistered slaughter facility where their meat was sold for human consumption.\n\nLSU's Phil Elzer, who at the time ran the Brucella studies and now is a university administrator, said in an interview the practice of sending research cattle to slaughter was declared in the lab's operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators. \"To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,\" Elzer said. LSU appealed, and the USDA eventually dropped the fine, he said.\n\nIn January 2010, records show, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed but reiterating the issues with the infected cow and the use of the unauthorized slaughter plant.\n\nUSDA officials acknowledge that they never imposed the $425,000 fine and made a mistake touting it in their report to Congress.\n\n\"It should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine,\" said Freeda Isaac, USDA's director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, in an emailed statement. Isaac added that the USDA suspended a portion of LSU's select agent registration because of the Brucella incident and \"that portion of the registration is still suspended,\" Isaac said last fall.\n\nFor those labs not in the select agent program — and even those that are — self-policing is the front line of biosafety. Biosafety committees at research institutions, often staffed by scientists' colleagues, assess the risks of proposed research and grant or deny approval for studies. Labs also have other safety staff who may do internal inspections and lab audits, plus additional committees overseeing the use of animals in research.\n\nYet some researchers appear ignorant of their institutions' biosafety rules. Others brazenly ignore repeated requests by biosafety staff to stop experiments and address issues.\n\nDocuments obtained by the USA TODAY Network include at least 50 incidents since 2012 in which researchers were conducting experiments with genetically manipulated organisms without proper approval from internal safety committees. In some cases, records show researchers flaunting their institutional rules.\n\n• At the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in, biosafety staff concluded in a 2013 report that the root causes of a researcher failing to get her experiments approved included \"general indifference of the investigator to institutional rules governing the need for biosafety compliance\" as well as a \"lack of oversight of research activities.\" The scientist, the investigation revealed, knowingly launched unapproved experiments — exposing mice to a genetically manipulated strain of Burkholderia thailandensis — in a quest to get a vaccine study manuscript published that reviewers said needed additional data. The research was halted after veterinarians found several cages containing dead and dying mice, yet none of the cages was labeled with the infectious agent and they were in an area not approved for experiments with a BSL-2 pathogen. The incident was \"an extremely unusual event,\" said Sheila Champlin, an assistant vice chancellor at the center, noting corrective actions were taken before the scientist was allowed to resume research.\n\n• At the University of Iowa, a biosafety officer in February 2014 discovered that a scientist had been conducting experiments with a genetically manipulated strain of the MERS virus since September 2013 without biosafety committee approval. The biosafety officer ordered the investigator to stop all experiments, and the scientist was put on probation and received increased safety monitoring. The work was being done in a BSL-3 lab at the time it was discovered, but started in a BSL-2 lab, the safety officer's investigation found. The university concluded that the scientist did not \"effectively communicate\" to his staff the importance of getting safety committee approval before starting the experiments with the virus, which can cause a deadly, contagious respiratory disease in people.\n\n• At the University of California-Irvine, a researcher ignored repeated notices from biosafety staff during 2012 and 2013 that a research project's approval had expired, that it needed further revisions and that all work must cease — yet the scientist continued the experiments with a lentivirus, anyway, in the BSL-2 lab. As a result of the incident, the university now sends researchers four notices starting 90 days before approvals expire, said James Hicks, the university's associate vice chancellor of research. As the deadline nears, Hicks is copied on the notices so he can intervene if necessary. \"We take a very strong view and a very correct view of the importance of following the regulations and the guidelines,\" he said in an interview.\n\n• At the University of Nebraska, a biosafety officer in 2013 found that a researcher had continued growing plants as part of an experiment using a transgenic tobacco rattle virus vector — despite being told repeatedly over two months that additional approval was needed from the biosafety committee before research could begin. As a result of the incident, the university said it revised its biosafety guidelines to describe consequences of unapproved research and sent a letter to faculty. \"This was an isolated instance that was fully and successfully resolved,\" the university said.\n\n• At the University of Hawaii-Manoa, biosafety staff discovered a scientist was doing a type of cancer research in 2012 despite being denied biosafety committee approval and being repeatedly told not to do the experiments. Separately, at a March 2013 biosafety committee meeting at the university, members discussed the need for penalties when researchers fail to comply with biosafety rules, stating \"there must be some consequence and corrective action other than an email\" to the scientist, the minutes say.\n\nLabs that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other federal agencies are required to report incidents to the NIH involving certain types of genetically engineered organisms and recombinant DNA technology. From 2010 through 2014, the NIH received 644 reports of lab incidents during this kind of research.\n\nMost of the reports the NIH receives are for what it says are non-serious incidents, such as small spills, splashes, cuts and equipment failures. Failure to obtain required biosafety committee approvals to do this type of research are among the more common types of non-compliance.\n\nAlthough it is not a regulatory agency, the NIH said in a statement that agency staff have made site visits to 100 institutions in recent years in an effort to help improve biosafety committee resources and adherence to the NIH Guidelines for operating their labs.\n\n\"Most instances of non-compliance result from a lack of full understanding of the requirements of the NIH Guidelines, rather than willful disregard, and our emphasis has been on corrective actions through education, which institutions seem uniformly responsive to,\" the NIH said.\n\nIn September 2014, the NIH contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had knowingly failed to report lab incidents as required, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told the NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to the NIH but should have been, the records show.\n\nThe records indicate that University of Louisville biosafety officials were aware of some of the unreported incidents as much as six months before the NIH opened its inquiry. William Pierce Jr., the university's executive vice president for research and innovation, in a statement to USA TODAY, said \"there was apparent confusion regarding the authority and responsibility for reporting violations to the NIH.\" Pierce said the university has hired an outside firm to oversee its biosafety committee and created training courses for scientists. \"We feel confident the current system is working,\" he said.\n\nThe NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency's questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future.\n\n\"In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance,\" the NIH said in response to USA TODAY's questions.\n\nFor some residents living near labs, the lack of transparency is frustrating — and worrisome. It's not enough to tell the public the labs have robust safety procedures. \"What people are really interested in is how well it's working,\" said Beth Willis, the citizen lab safety representative near Fort Detrick. \"The more people in the community feel that there's secrecy, the more they're distrustful, whether their distrust is warranted or not.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/05/22/michigan-farmworker-second-u-s-case-avian-influenza-transmitted-cow-to-human/73806301007/", "title": "H5N1 bird flu human case confirmed in Michigan farmworker", "text": "A Michigan dairy farmworker is the second person in the U.S. to contract avian influenza from a cow, state health officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe worker, a man, developed conjunctivitis, which is an eye infection commonly known as pinkeye, as his only symptom and has fully recovered, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical officer, told the Free Press.\n\nThe man worked on a farm with cattle infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza strain that's spreading across the U.S. in poultry and dairy cows. He had direct contact with sick cattle, she said. The Texas dairy farmworker who had the first known U.S. case of cow-to-human transmission, which was identified April 1, also worked closely with infected cattle.\n\nCiting privacy concerns, no details were released Wednesday about specifically which farm employed the Michigan worker or in which county the infection occurred. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development reported Monday that avian influenza outbreaks have been identified in 18 dairy cow herds in the following Michigan counties: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Allegan, Ingham, Isabella, Montcalm, Barry and Ottawa.\n\nIt's more cow herd outbreaks than in any other state, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Since the outbreak began in February 2022, H5N1 avian influenza also has been detected in domestic birds from 23 Michigan counties: Bay, Branch, Cass, Eaton, Genesee, Gratiot, Ingham, Ionia, Kalamazoo, Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Menominee, Montmorency, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oakland, Ottawa, Saginaw, Sanilac, Tuscola, Washtenaw and Wexford.\n\n'The system worked'\n\nA surveillance program set up by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and MDARD led to the detection of the state's first human case, Bagdasarian said.\n\n\"We set up a robust public health symptom monitoring system to detect cases and that's exactly what the system did,\" she said. That includes an automated text messaging system that allows farmworkers to complete surveys about symptoms that might be indicative of an H5N1 infection and could signal a need for testing.\n\n\"Our local health departments have relationships with the farms in their jurisdictions and are working with them in whatever way works best for them in that particular situation. ... There's symptom monitoring using text messages, automated text messages, where folks can just reply, 'yes,' if they're having any of the symptoms mentioned.\"\n\nIt's unclear, Bagdasarian said, whether this infected farmworker used the text messaging system or some other method to alert local public health leaders about his symptoms.\n\n\"The lesson learned from this is that these are the things that public health needs to do ... to track the emergence of new diseases, monitor changes in disease epidemiology,\" she said. \"The system worked.\n\n\"It is unsurprising, given what we know about H5 influenza, to find one sporadic case in a human because we know that H5 influenza does cause sporadic cases in humans when there is close exposure to impacted animals.\"\n\nNo need to panic\n\nThough a Michigan man has contracted avian influenza, Bagdasarian said the average Michigander shouldn't panic.\n\n\"The risk to the general public remains low,\" she said. \"And that's for a few reasons: No. 1, we have not seen evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. ... For this to become a bigger risk to the general public, we would be looking for sustained human-to-human transmission and we have not seen that.\"\n\nFarmworkers, especially those working with infected animals, however, have a higher level of risk.\n\n\"We have recommendations regarding personal protective equipment. We have made personal protective equipment available and we'll continue to encourage people to use it,\" Bagdasarian said.\n\nAdditionally, she said, symptom monitoring will continue and if workers do get infected with the virus, antiviral drugs will be recommended for treatment and for postexposure prophylaxis.\n\n\"We have seasonal influenza vaccines so that we can make sure that people are not co-infected with multiple strains of influenza, so we'll continue to use those. We'll continue to use all the tools that we have at our disposal,\" Bagdasarian said.\n\nSymptomatic eyes\n\nWhat's unique about the Michigan man with avian influenza is that his nasal swab sample tested negative for the virus, but a sample from the worker's eye, which was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for additional testing, came back positive, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, during a Wednesday afternoon news conference.\n\n\"We received the samples yesterday (Tuesday), tested them throughout the day,\" Shah said, and results were reported Tuesday night to Michigan health officials.\n\n\"The fact that the nasal specimen here tested negative while the conjunctival specimen tested positive underscores two things: One is, in a sense, it's reassuring. It reduces the likelihood — it does not eliminate — but it reduces the likelihood of a respiratory route of transmission,\" Shah said. \"The other thing is that it underscores the importance of PPE, barrier protection, in particular for the eyes because now this being the second case where conjunctivitis was a feature, if not the chief feature of illness.\n\n\"In the Texas example ... that individual tested positive for both their nasal and conjunctival swab.\"\n\nThe CDC recommends people who work on dairy farms and poultry farms and in slaughterhouses use personal protective equipment such as N95 particulate respirator masks, fluid-resistant coveralls, safety goggles or face shields, waterproof aprons, gloves, headcovers and rubber boots when working around farm animals.\n\nHowever, the agency said it's unclear exactly how transmission between infected cattle and humans is occurring and why the two known human cases have involved eye infections.\n\n\"It may be from contamination of the eye(s), potentially with a splash of contaminated fluid, or touching the eye(s) with something contaminated with A(H5N1) virus, such as a hand. High levels of A(H5N1) virus have been found in unpasteurized milk from H5N1-infected cows,\" the CDC said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\n\"Given the high levels of A(H5N1) virus in raw milk from infected cows, and the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, similar additional human cases could be identified. Sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public.\"\n\nHelp for farms\n\nHelp is available to any Michigan farm in need of PPE for workers, said Chelsea Wuth, a spokesperson for MDHHS.\n\n\"If any farm is in need of more PPE, MDHHS and MDARD are coordinating a one-time provision to meet this need and protect workers,\" Wuth said. \"Farms can reach out to MDARD to request a one-time provision of PPE. MDARD will relay these requests to MDHHS which will determine local, regional, state or federal resources to fill requests.\n\n\"Local health departments remain in conversations with farms and may supply PPE as well depending on local needs. MDHHS and local health departments will support the farms and MDARD to help address these concerns.\"\n\nDawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said Wednesday that the Strategic National Stockpile also can provide such items as goggles and N95 respirators and gloves to states that request them.\n\nIn addition, O'Connell said, the antiviral drug Tamiflu will be made available from the federal stockpile if needed. And ASPR \"started the fill-and-finish process for approximately 1.8 million doses of vaccine that is well matched to the currently circulating strain of H5N1 through the National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile Program,\" she said.\n\nEric Deeble, acting senior adviser for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the federal government also is offering financial assistance for farmers with dairy herds that have been infected with avian influenza and will be expanding the program to include funding even to farms where cattle have yet to be infected so they can shore up their biosecurity efforts, including the veterinary costs for testing animals and the shipping costs for those lab tests.\n\nAvian influenza has torn through Michigan's bird population for two years, forcing commercial farmers and people with backyard coops to kill roughly 6.8 million infected chickens and turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese and guinea fowl across the state — all with the hope of slowing the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.\n\nCulling infected flocks hasn't been enough to curtail the assault from the virus, so earlier this month MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring declared an \"extraordinary emergency\" in the state, requiring farms to implement biosecurity practices and create emergency preparedness plans.\n\n“Since the first detection of influenza A (H5N1) in dairy cattle on March 29, Michigan has prioritized both the animal and human health aspects of this disease outbreak. Today’s news underscores the continued importance of limiting nonessential farm visits, including farm tours and field trips, as well as the use of personal protective equipment when working with livestock,” Boring said in a statement issued Wednesday.\n\nThe first human case of bird flu in the U.S. was reported in 2022 in a person in Colorado who had been exposed to infected poultry. The person's only symptom was fatigue.\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Read more here.\n\nFor the past three years, most Americans have enjoyed access to free COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines regardless of insurance status thanks to unprecedented funding from the federal government.\n\nBut that's all about the change as the Biden administration plans to end both the national emergency and the public health emergency May 11.\n\nExperts say access to COVID-19 services will now depend on insurance coverage through Medicaid, Medicare or private companies.\n\nThe end of the public health emergency may also jeopardize coverage for millions of Americans. Those who are uninsured, which is approximately 8% of the U.S. population, have few options for COVID-19 care, said Jodie Guest, professor and vice chair of the department of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health.\n\nThe Biden administration will be shifting health care costs associated with COVID-19 from the government back to individual Americans, she said. \"Our insurance and health care system is pretty chaotic and very expensive, and we’re going back to that.\"\n\nBased on insurance coverage, here's how the end of public health emergency services may affect you.\n\nCOVID-19 tests\n\nOrdering free at-home tests through COVIDtests.gov is likely to go away with the end of the public health emergency, experts say.\n\nMedicaid : Free tests until 2024.\n\n: Free tests until 2024. Medicare: No longer will receive at-home tests for free.\n\nNo longer will receive at-home tests for free. Private insurers: Varies by state and insurance company.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction tests – known as the PCR tests – are considered \"the gold standard\" for detecting the COVID-19 virus, health experts say. But they may cost up to $100 if not covered, Guest said.\n\nSee previously:Labs are charging up to $14,000 for coronavirus tests. Insurers claim 'price gouging.'\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines\n\nWith the emergency declaration ending, there may be new economic barriers to getting vaccinated.\n\nManufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna sold their vaccines to the government for about $20 a dose, said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, professor of health policy management at City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.\n\nBut now, both companies said they're considering price hikes between $110 and $130, Lee said.\n\nMedicaid: Free vaccines, no end date determined.\n\nFree vaccines, no end date determined. Medicare : Undetermined.\n\n: Undetermined. Private Insurers: Varies by state and insurance company.\n\nWhile private insurance companies may be inclined to cover vaccines similar to annual influenza shots, Guest said nothing is guaranteed. Those without insurance coverage may have to pay the entire cost.\n\nWhat's the future of COVID boosters?FDA panel moves toward simplifying shots.\n\nCOVID-19 treatment\n\nThere's not many treatment options for COVID-19 after the FDA announced last month monoclonal antibody Evusheld is no longer authorized to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the U.S.\n\nBut ending the public health emergency may limit access to the few drugs available, including antiviral Paxlovid from Pfizer, health experts say.\n\nMedicaid : Covered until 2024.\n\n: Covered until 2024. Medicare: Covered through 2024.\n\nCovered through 2024. Private Insurers: Varies by state and insurance company.\n\nLee also worries the lack of emergency funding and a return to the slow approval process may demotivate companies from funding research into more COVID-19 treatments and better vaccines.\n\nLATEST: What to know about Paxlovid, the COVID antiviral that keeps people out of the hospital\n\nTelehealth\n\nBefore 2020, most states had rules that limited access to telehealth services depending on where someone lived, Guest said. But COVID-19 and the public health emergency blew that door wide open.\n\n\"The availability of telehealth was no longer geographically restricted. There was an expansion of access, particularly through Medicare and Medicaid,\" she said. \"There's some concern that a lot of people will lose access to telehealth\" now that the declaration is ending.\n\nHealth experts worry this may disproportionately affect Americans living in rural areas and those with limited access to general health care services.\n\nMedicaid : States to decide.\n\n: States to decide. Medicare : Covered through 2024.\n\n: Covered through 2024. Private Insurers: Varies by state and insurance company.\n\nMedicaid coverage\n\nBefore the pandemic, Medicaid recipients underwent a yearly review to make sure they still qualified, Guest said. The public health emergency paused that review and prevented states from taking people off Medicaid.\n\nWith that review process returning, millions of Americans are at risk for not qualifying and losing Medicaid coverage.\n\nMore:As pandemic-era provisions lapse, millions of Americans to lose Medicaid\n\nHospital funding\n\nWhen the emergency declaration ends, it may mean hospitals won't get extra funding, health experts say.\n\n\"Hospitals received a 20% increase in the funds they wouldn't normally have if they discharged a COVID case alive,\" Guest said. \"That will go away.\"\n\nHealth experts fear the lack of funding will lead to more hospital closures, particularly in rural areas, and will leave health care providers unprepared for future coronavirus waves.\n\nDig deeper\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

He would be the oldest person to ever be elected president.\n\nPast and current advisers to Biden have held frequent conversations about options to alleviate concerns about age, including teaming him with a younger running mate. One option that has been floated, according to a source with knowledge of the talks, is outgoing Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who at 46 has become the subject of intense 2020 speculation after nearly beating GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBiden says his family convinced him to run with Obama\n\nAP source: Joe Biden to meet with family as he ponders 2020\n\nBiden urges political engagement in Brown University speech\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Representatives for Biden and O'Rourke declined to comment for this story.\n\nAt a town hall Friday in El Paso, Texas, O'Rourke said he hadn't made a decision about whether to seek the presidency.\n\nThe question of age has roiled Democratic politics since the midterms. At 78, Rep. Nancy Pelosi is on her way to regaining the House speaker's gavel – but only after she agreed with mostly younger lawmakers to serve in the position for no more than four years. Other potential presidential contenders, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, 69, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 77, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 76, face the prospect of competing against Democrats who are decades younger.\n\nThe younger set of the 2020 class includes Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota along with Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and Obama housing secretary Julian Castro. They're all in their 40s and 50s.\n\nIowa Democratic activist Dale Todd, who was an early backer of Barack Obama in 2007, said he has misgivings about potential candidates in their 70s despite their experience.\n\n\"Can you mobilize younger voters with older candidates? Bernie showed us that you can, but can you effectively mobilize a winning coalition with an older candidate? That is our conundrum, and I would suggest you probably can't,\" said Todd, who has lent early advice to Booker. \"We want freshness coupled with experience; we also want energy and passion in our candidates.\"\n\nRonald Reagan was 73 when he won the White House a second time, making him the oldest person to win a presidential election. Donald Trump was 70 when he won the presidency in 2016.\n\nUniversity of Delaware's School of Public Policy renamed for Joe Biden\n\nAfter fostering Major, the Bidens adopt the German shepherd as part of family\n\nBiden is expected to decide in January or February whether to seek the White House. He has done little to tamp down talk that his answer may be yes.\n\nHe touts his age as a sign of experience, pointing to 36 years in the Senate; eight years as vice president; and a career deeply enmeshed in domestic, international and military policy. At an event in Montana this month, Biden described himself as \"the most qualified person in the country to be president.\"\n\n\"The issues we face as a country today are the issues that have been in my wheelhouse, that I've worked on my whole life,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Biden spoke of a promise he made to his dying son that he wouldn't withdraw from the world.\n\nAnd yet, Biden has also said he could not re-enter the grueling race for the presidency unless he feels his family, still dealing with Beau Biden's 2015 death, is fully on board.\n\nThe Utah event was expected to be Biden's last public appearance of the year. He'll spend the coming weeks deliberating with family over his next steps, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. They requested anonymity because Biden is still weighing his options.\n\nDespite questions about age, it's hard to argue Biden is short on energy or passion.\n\nIn the span of just 24 hours this month, he jetted from an appearance in San Francisco back to his home in Delaware and back to California again. In the days leading up to the midterms, he followed a robust schedule intended in part to test his stamina for a national campaign. In late October, he was in three states – Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri – over the course of one day.\n\nDELAWARE NEWS:\n\nWilmington Council president to councilmen: Your 'Coalition of Foolishness' is out of order\n\nEqual Rights Amendment likely to pass in early 2019: How will that change government?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/03/05/delaware-beach-towns-offered-payout-to-support-offshore-wind-projects/72841060007/", "title": "Delaware beach towns offered payout to support offshore wind ...", "text": "Delaware's coastal towns have been offered their payout for allowing offshore wind projects to take place.\n\nOffshore wind development company US Wind officially presented Delaware’s coastal communities a sizable investment package, signaling another step toward Delaware’s all but confirmed offshore future.\n\nThe projects have yet to receive the green light from the federal government, and concerns from residents and lawmakers about the deal already are being expressed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/05/read-delaware-governors-final-state-of-the-state-speech/72266477007/", "title": "Read Delaware governor's final State of the State speech", "text": "Delaware Gov. John Carney delivered his last State of the State address at 2 p.m. Tuesday, March 5, at Legislative Hall in Dover.\n\nThe Democrat was set to give his State of the State address in January, but Carney fell ill and had to postpone the speech. The speech marks Carney’s last as Delaware governor. The state constitution prohibits the governor from running for a third four-year term.\n\nCarney already presented his 2025 proposed budget Jan. 25, which highlighted plans to address Delaware’s soaring health care costs; increase funding for education and professionals; continue investments in agriculture and environment; invest in housing and small business development; and pay for improvements in government infrastructure and buildings.\n\nCarney's term is up this year, but he is considering running for mayor in Wilmington.\n\nRead Carney's full address below:\n\nLt. Governor Hall-Long, Madam Speaker, Mister President Pro Tem, Senate Majority Leader, Members of the 152nd General Assembly and other elected officials, Members of the Cabinet, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, invited guests, and my fellow Delawareans.\n\nThank you for inviting me into the chamber today.\n\nLet me start by recognizing the historic nature of today’s event.\n\nFor the first time, a female Speaker of the House is presiding over the State of the State address.\n\nJoin me in recognizing Speaker (Valerie) Longhurst and her leadership team – Majority Leader Melissa Minor-Brown, Majority Whip Kerri Evelyn Harris, and new Joint Finance Committee Chair Kim Williams.\n\nI look forward to working with you all the rest of this session.\n\nI also want to take a moment to recognize two new justices on the Delaware Supreme Court – Justice Abby LeGrow and Justice Chris Griffiths.\n\nWe have a world-class judiciary in Delaware.\n\nJustice LeGrow and Justice Griffiths bring a new generation of leadership to our Courts.\n\nJoin me in thanking them for their commitment to public service.\n\nAnd a moment of personal privilege – if I may.\n\nI’d like to recognize my wife, Tracey, for all the hard work she’s done on behalf of Delaware children over the past seven years.\n\nTracey has transformed the role of the First Lady, we like to call her the First Spouse – and made sure every Delaware child has a First Chance to succeed.\n\nShe has also stood by me throughout my 30 plus years in public service. And let me tell you, it’s not always been easy.\n\nThank you, Tracey, for your support.\n\nBefore I go any further, I’d also like to recognize the Army and Air National Guard.\n\nGeneral Mike Berry is unable to be with us today, but he is represented by Brigadier General James Benson.\n\nIt’s been a busy time for the Guard – and I think a lot about their sacrifice.\n\nOver the past seven years, more than 1,300 Guardsmen and women have deployed to more than 50 locations around the world.\n\nLast year, we held a deployment ceremony for more than 150 Army National Guardsmen and women from the 160th Engineer Company.\n\nThey recently returned from a military operation in Southwest Asia.\n\nMembers of that unit who were deployed are with us today.\n\nPlease join me in recognizing our citizen soldiers. They’re the very best.\n\nIt’s hard to believe – but this is my last State of the State Address as Governor.\n\nAnd I think it’s worth a little reflection.\n\nOn what we’ve accomplished together.\n\nAnd on our unfinished business.\n\nFirst and foremost, we’ve helped create more than 30,000 new jobs since 2017. That’s a big deal.\n\nFor the first time in Delaware history, we’ve provided funding dedicated for low-income students and English learners in our public schools.\n\nWe’ve given teachers a BIG raise.\n\nFor three years running, we’ve implemented the largest infrastructure plan in state history. That means good jobs— building new schools, safer roads and bridges, and connecting Delawareans to the internet, up and down the state.\n\nAnd we’ve kept our fiscal house in order. We turned a $400 million dollar budget deficit in 2017 to $400 million in reserves. That’s a big deal.\n\nWe’re supporting an economic resurgence in downtown Wilmington.\n\nWe’ve provided paid leave for Delaware families – and raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The labor market has blown through that already.\n\nWe’re building more affordable housing units – so Delaware families have a safe place to call home.\n\nWe’ve reduced crime, and our prison population is down nearly 24%.\n\nWe passed sweeping climate change legislation – committing to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAnd we’re keeping our communities safe, by banning assault weapons and launching targeted gun safety measures.\n\nThese are issues that matter to Delaware families in each of your districts.\n\nAnd that matter to future generations:\n\nGood jobs.\n\nQuality schools.\n\nSafe and affordable communities.\n\nA cleaner environment.\n\nAnd responsible management of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn this last year, I’m focused on leaving the state in a better place than I found it.\n\nWe should make sure the next governor is in the best possible position to succeed.\n\nAnd we should balance the budget and make sure our investments are sustainable in the long run.\n\nI want to thank everyone in this room for your partnership.\n\nWe don’t always agree.\n\nBut working together is what we do best in Delaware.\n\nBecause of our hard work together, I can confidently say that the State of our State is strong. And getting stronger by the day.\n\nAs many of you know, I spent a lot of time on the football field. As a player and as a coach. I know, it was a long time ago.\n\nBut one thing I learned, is that the best teams leave it all on the field.\n\nIn that spirit, I want to talk about some of our unfinished business.\n\nAnd the work I believe we can still accomplish together.\n\nWe’ve made big strides on financial management. I want to recognize Senator Paradee and Representative Carson for their good work last year, as well as our Bond Chairs, Senator Walsh and Representative Heffernan.\n\nBut, despite our efforts, we did not pass legislation to permanently control operating spending at sustainable levels.\n\nAn earlier General Assembly rejected my proposed Constitutional amendment that would have done just that.\n\nIt’s really pretty simple.\n\nDelaware can’t compete in the future if we don’t have our budget in order.\n\nRight now, a future General Assembly, or a Governor, could lead us down a path of uncontrolled spending.\n\nThat would lead to higher taxes, and painful cuts.\n\nSo let’s not go backwards. Instead, let’s build on the progress we’ve made.\n\nThis year, I’m asking you to send me legislation that would make our spending benchmark permanent.\n\nI won’t be here next year. But most of you will.\n\nDon’t set yourselves up for failure.\n\nI hope we can find common ground on this important priority for every Delaware taxpayer.\n\nWe also have a serious issue with health care cost inflation.\n\nThis year, between Medicaid and our insurance plan for state employees and retirees, we’re spending nearly $2 billion on health care alone.\n\nLet me say that again: $2 BILLION– with a B.\n\nAnd that’s roughly $200 million more than our costs last year.\n\nThe state’s share of Medicaid alone costs $1 billion.\n\nThose are jaw-dropping numbers.\n\nIt’s almost a third of our state budget. It’s only going up – and taxpayers are footing the bill.\n\nIf we don’t get serious, health care spending will crowd out other investments.\n\nInvestments we all support.\n\nFunding for public schools.\n\nFor affordable housing and child care.\n\nAnd raises for state employees, and state retirees. Right now, retirees get their pay increases in the funding needed to cover their health care.\n\nThis is literally an issue we cannot afford to ignore.\n\nWe should all work together to strengthen our health care benchmark and address health care cost inflation.\n\nSenator Townsend and Speaker Longhurst, I know you and many in this room agree.\n\nI look forward to working together on those issues.\n\nOf course, no issue is more important to our state’s future than the quality of Delaware’s public schools.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time the last seven years focused on strengthening our schools.\n\nEspecially for children who need our help the most. I know Senator Sokola and many others have been leaders on this issue over the years.\n\nTogether, we created Opportunity Funding. A program that provides additional funding for low-income students and English learners.\n\nOur budget increases funding for this program to $63 million.\n\nI can assure you that it’s making a real difference.\n\nLast fall, I visited East Millsboro Elementary and spoke with a young student who had been struggling to read.\n\nWorking with a reading specialist funded through Opportunity Funding, she was improving by leaps and bounds.\n\nThat reading coach, Heather Ruark, is here with us today.\n\nJoin me in recognizing her good work.\n\nOver the past seven years, we’ve also built new schools across the state.\n\nWe’ve spent $1.5 billion on school construction alone.\n\nLet me tell you: a school is much more than bricks and mortar.\n\nIt’s the pillar of a community.\n\nAnd nowhere is that more true than on the East Side of Wilmington, where we’re building the first new school in the city in over half a century.\n\nThe old Bancroft school will be named the Maurice Pritchett Sr. Academy – after the school’s longtime principal, and community icon, Maurice Pritchett.\n\nI’m looking forward to the school opening later this year.\n\nStudents, teachers, and neighbors on the East Side will have a state-of-the-art school building they can take pride in.\n\nJoin me in recognizing members of the Pritchett family, who are here with us today.\n\nWe also launched the Wilmington Learning Collaborative to provide a hyper-focus on schools in our largest city.\n\nFor the first time, districts serving the city are working together to address the needs of Wilmington children. I also want to recognize Senator Tizzy Lockman for her work in this area as well. I know it’s a priority we both share.\n\nAnd finally, we have significantly expanded mental health services in our schools.\n\nThe need became even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI want to thank Speaker Longhurst for her leadership on this effort.\n\nWorking together, I look forward to expanding these services into high schools this year.\n\nThese are initiatives that we all can be proud of.\n\nBut it simply isn’t enough.\n\nHere’s an uncomfortable truth: statewide, less than 40 percent of children are reading proficiently at third grade. And many schools fall short of that average.\n\nImagine if YOUR child went to a school with that kind of result.\n\nNone of us would tolerate that.\n\nBut too many children across our state are faced with this reality.\n\nAnd we need to fix it.\n\nThat’s why my budget includes funding for a new team of literacy coaches.\n\nThey will work with educators and district leaders to focus on the science of reading – an effective approach to teaching children how to read.\n\nIt’s one of the most important things we can do.\n\nI hope you’ll join me in supporting this priority.\n\nMy budget also includes a continued focus on early childhood education.\n\nI know this is a priority that many of you share.\n\nOur priority is simple: create more seats for the children and families who need them the most.\n\nThe research is clear.\n\nIt shows that children who have access to quality early childhood education have better outcomes.\n\nThat includes higher graduation rates and more financial stability into adulthood.\n\nJust 15 years ago, the state was investing next to nothing in childcare.\n\nMy budget includes more than $135 million for childcare.\n\nThat’s a big deal – and these are critical investments that will benefit our children as they grow up.\n\nBefore I leave the topic of education, I want to recognize and thank Secretary Mark Holodick for all his hard work.\n\nMark was a teacher, a principal, and superintendent before he took on the job as cabinet Secretary.\n\nAnd his leadership has been tremendous.\n\nOver the past 19 months, Secretary Holodick chaired the Public Education Compensation Committee.\n\nThe group studied educator pay.\n\nAnd they presented a recommendation for paying our teachers what they deserve.\n\nI’m determined to win the competition with the states around us.\n\nWe want the best educators working right here in the First State.\n\nThat’s why my budget fully funds the first year of those recommendations for educators – building on the raise I signed into law last year.\n\nIf we stick to the plan, we will raise teachers’ starting salaries to $60,000 over the next four years.\n\nLet’s get it done.\n\nI would like to take a moment to recognize our Lieutenant Governor, Bethany Hall-Long.\n\nLt. Governor Hall-Long has been a real partner over these past seven years. She’s a nurse, as you all know. And her efforts on the ground during the COVID-19 pandemic were just tremendous.\n\nShe knows how to roll up her sleeves and get things done.\n\nThe Lt. Governor has also been a champion of science and technology and advancing STEM careers for young people in our state, particularly young girls.\n\nLast summer I signed Senate Bill 55, creating Delaware’s Rare Disease Advisory Council.\n\nThis new council will bring together the best and brightest to help support those living with rare diseases.\n\nThe effort was led by Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long, along with Senator Nicole Poore and Representative Krista Griffith.\n\nPlease join me in recognizing the Lieutenant Governor and the leaders of these efforts.\n\nI’d like to take another moment to recognize my wife Tracey for all her good work as First Spouse, especially her work on early literacy.\n\nSince 2017, Tracey has been focused on giving all Delaware children a “First Chance” to succeed.\n\nWorking with State Librarian Dr. Annie Norman, she helped expand Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library statewide in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nNow, more than half of eligible children are signed up for free books every month.\n\nAgain, there’s nothing more important than helping our children learn how to read.\n\nThis free program will help us to do just that.\n\nIn addition, last year, Tracey led a discussion on our trauma-informed progress. And she hosted our first youth mental health summit.\n\nIt takes all of us, working together, to make sure that Delaware children have a First Chance to succeed – from birth to adulthood.\n\nPlease join me again in recognizing Tracey’s great work.\n\nOf course, one of the best ways to expand opportunity is to keep our economy strong and growing.\n\nAs the saying goes, a good job solves a lot of problems.\n\nGood jobs help families pay the bills, buy a home, save for college and retirement – and sock away some money for vacation.\n\nGood jobs also increase our state’s revenue, and help us fund top priorities.\n\nOn my first day in office, I signed an executive order to rethink our approach to economic development.\n\nAnd together, we created the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.\n\nBy every measure, it’s been a success.\n\nJust in the last two years, we’ve created more than 20,000 jobs.\n\nThat’s a big deal.\n\nMy budget continues our investments in job creation.\n\nIn the Strategic Fund, Site Readiness, in Graduation Lab Space, and our Transportation Infrastructure Investment Fund.\n\nWe will not lose the competition with other states for good jobs.\n\nWe also have our eye on the future of Delaware’s economy.\n\nMy budget again includes additional funding for the federal research projects, NIIMBL and SABRE, at the STAR campus at the University of Delaware.\n\nBoth projects will build on Delaware’s strong foundation in science and technology.\n\nThey will attract more high-quality workers to Delaware and spur innovation and business development.\n\nYou all know this.\n\nBut our colleges and universities are more important than ever to the future of our economy.\n\nAt Delaware State University, Dr. Allen and his team have opened a new Early Childhood Innovation Center. The Center will train the next generation of early childhood educators.\n\nAnd at Delaware Tech, Dr. Brainard remains at the forefront of job training in our state.\n\nWe still have more jobs available than we have people looking for work.\n\nIt’s an issue you’ve heard me talk about before.\n\nRight now, there are 31,000 jobs available, but only 21,000 people looking for work.\n\nThat requires an intensive focus on job training – and on the skills demanded by Delaware’s employers.\n\nDelaware Tech is leading on that work.\n\nJoin me in recognizing Dr. Assanis, Dr. Allen, and Dr. Brainard and their teams for their hard work and dedication to the future of our state.\n\nWe are also exploring federal funding opportunities.\n\nAnd we’ve had success.\n\nLast year, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were selected by the federal government for a hydrogen hub.\n\nThe program was funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy selected just seven proposals – out of 79 applications across the country.\n\nAnd we were one of the seven.\n\nThe federal designation will bring $750 million to the region.\n\nMake no mistake: this is a generational opportunity to build a clean energy industry right here in Delaware. And to compete for good union jobs of the future.\n\nWe also received $50 million in federal funding to help expand the Port of Wilmington.\n\nFor decades, jobs at the Port have been a gateway to the middle class for thousands of workers and their families.\n\nThese are the kinds of jobs our state and country were built on.\n\nWe are also increasing support for towns and cities.\n\nLast year, we celebrated additional funding to redevelop the once-blighted Nylon Capital Shopping Center in Seaford.\n\nWe’re building new affordable housing on the east side of Wilmington – and our Housing Director, Eugene Young, and his team are leading that work.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, we announced plans to supercharge the redevelopment of downtown Dover. That will help us attract workers to the area and expand economic opportunity in our historic capital city.\n\nI know that work is important to Senator Paradee, Representatives Harris, Bush, Lynn and many others.\n\nI appreciate your leadership and your partnership.\n\nIf we want to keep good jobs and workers in Delaware, we need to make sure families feel safe in their communities.\n\nI know fighting gun violence has been a shared priority.\n\nOver the past seven years, we’ve banned assault weapons, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.\n\nWe’ve passed red flag laws and prevented straw purchases.\n\nThis year, we’ll take another big step forward and pass the permit to purchase law.\n\nInside the administration, we’ve spent a lot of time on what we call Group Violence Intervention – or GVI.\n\nWe started GVI in Wilmington and have expanded the program to Dover.\n\nHere’s the truth: it’s a very small number of people who are committing the vast majority of gun violence in these communities.\n\nThey are part of groups that fight with one another.\n\nThrough GVI, we are directly engaging with those individuals and the gangs and groups they’re part of.\n\nWe’re demanding that they put down their guns.\n\nIf they do, we will offer job training and other social services.\n\nFor those who choose the path of violence, they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And Attorney General Jennings has been doing that.\n\nMore than 300 people have participated in GVI since it started.\n\nJust in the last several months, we have started offering GVI services in Laurel – where we saw a spike in lethal shootings.\n\nWe are a committed partner in efforts to prevent gun violence in western Sussex County. The Delaware State Police has been instrumental in our response. And we appreciate the support of Representatives Dukes and Short and Senator Richardson in those efforts.\n\nThe future of our communities depends on it.\n\nAs we look toward the future, we can’t ignore the threat of climate change.\n\nDelaware is the lowest-lying state in the country.\n\nDrive through some of our coastal and back-bay communities and you’ll see it for yourself.\n\nIt’s clear we’re already feeling the effects of sea rise.\n\nThat’s why we’re spending more than $30 million to harden our coastal infrastructure.\n\nProjects like the one to raise South Bowers Road to make sure residents can get in and out of town during storms.\n\nThat’s pretty important.\n\nAnd I want to thank Secretary Majeski and Secretary Garvin for their leadership in this area.\n\nLast year, many of you were instrumental in passing the most significant climate change legislation in our state’s history.\n\nHouse Bill 99 set ambitious – but achievable targets.\n\nWe committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. And achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This is critical for future generations.\n\nI want to recognize Senator Hansen, Representative Heffernan, and Representative Phillips for their hard work and leadership on this issue.\n\nWe have a General Assembly full of leaders who understand the threat of climate change. And who have the political will to take action.\n\nThank you for your leadership.\n\nThe transition to clean energy won’t be easy.\n\nAt times, it will be controversial.\n\nIn December, DNREC finalized regulations to reduce transportation emissions in our state – a big source of carbon and other air pollution.\n\nBy 2032, the regulations require that 82 percent of vehicles delivered to Delaware be zero emission vehicles.\n\nThat will help us reach our targets under House Bill 99. And we’re following industry trends across the country.\n\nMajor automakers are already committed to moving toward electric vehicles.\n\nOur efforts will also make sure Delaware isn’t left behind in this transition.\n\nThe threat of climate change is also why we’re taking a fresh look at Delaware’s role in the offshore wind industry.\n\nIn December, we began negotiations with offshore wind developer US Wind to bring significant benefits to our state.\n\nAnd to take an active leadership role in offshore wind development.\n\nUnder terms of the agreement, US Wind would bring wind energy into Delaware.\n\nWe expect the agreement to bring more than $100 million in benefits to our state without raising rates.\n\nThose benefits include funding for workforce development. For dredging projects and for projects to mitigate the effects of climate change in our State Parks.\n\nOver the next several months, I hope you’ll join me in taking another big step forward.\n\nWe are pursuing legislation that will make Delaware more of an active player in offshore wind.\n\nIt will allow us to directly purchase wind-generated renewable energy. And to explore partnerships with states in our region.\n\nAnd Senator Hansen – I know this is a big priority of yours.\n\nWe look forward to working together on this very important issue.\n\nI want to end where I started – with some reflection.\n\nIt’s been a great honor for me to serve as your Governor.\n\nI believe the opportunity to serve as an elected official is the greatest privilege that a people can bestow on one of their own.\n\nOne of our colleagues who has enjoyed that privilege for 21 years is Representative Pete Schwartzkopf.\n\nJoin me in recognizing the former Speaker for his incredible service.\n\nThese last seven years haven’t always been easy.\n\nThe three years of the pandemic felt more like 10.\n\nBut for me, the privilege to serve as Governor has been an incredible gift.\n\nI got to travel to every corner of our state. And meet people where they are.\n\nIn fire houses.\n\nIn schools.\n\nAt festivals and parades.\n\nAnd during tragic circumstances, as well – like fires, natural disasters, and funeral testimonials.\n\nI’ve been privileged to listen to people’s hopes and aspirations.\n\nAnd to share in their good times – and their bad.\n\nI’ve learned that the most important thing for an elected official is to earn the trust of the people you represent.\n\nThey will give you the benefit of the doubt – so long as they trust you’re always trying to do the right thing.\n\nIf you earn that trust, they will follow you when times are tough.\n\nFinally, I want to thank, Tracey and our boys, Sam and Jimmy, for the sacrifices they’ve made during my time in public service.\n\nI couldn’t have done it without them.\n\nFor the rest of this year, we’ll continue to do the right thing.\n\nAnd working together, we’ll leave the state better off for generations to come.\n\nI look forward to leaving it all on the field in this last year.\n\nThank you for your hard work – and your trust.\n\nGod Bless You.\n\nAnd God Bless the Great State of Delaware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}]}

A fourth is located just over the state line on U.S. 322 in Pennsylvania.\n\nDesigned by the Wilmington agency Deardorff Associates, the advertisements consist of single-sentence messages, such as \"An amazing amount of business takes off here,\" and \"Helping the Delaware economy fly,\" laid over images of airplanes or a listing of businesses at the facility.\n\nOne includes the words \"industry,\" ''jobs,\" ''development\" and \"revenue\" underneath the message, \"We're a lot more than just planes.\"\n\n\"It's a way for us to get our story out there - a story we don't often tell and one the public might not be aware of,\" said John Sarro, the DRBA's airport marketing manager.\n\nThat story, he said, is about the airport's economic impact in New Castle County and its role as an engine of job creation.\n\n\"Many people who drive by every day may not understand what goes on here other than passenger service,\" he said. \"They may not know about the jobs that are here or the economic development.\"\n\nWhen the DRBA took over the airport from the county in 1995, the facility was wallowing in debt. Today, the airport is a profitable enterprise with several new or upgraded buildings.\n\nA 2013 economic impact study commissioned by DelDOT found that businesses at New Castle Airport - as it identified the facility - directly employed more than 1,600 workers, with another 700 indirectly supported by those companies.\n\nThe total economic impact of the facility at that time, the study found, was $240.5 million a year - resulting in an annual state and local tax contribution of $10.5 million.\n\nYet those numbers were down from a similar study conducted in 2007, with employment supported by the airport having slid 5 percent and total economic impact down by 13 percent.\n\nThat followed a similar trend recorded at two of Delaware's three general aviation airports and most of the state's six smaller public-use airports as those facilities continued to recover from the 2008 recession.\n\nFrontier's pullout leaves Delaware without airline service\n\nNew Castle Airport suffered another hit this summer when it officially lost Frontier Airlines.\n\nAfter two years of providing commercial passenger service out of Delaware, the Denver-based airline abruptly ended service there in June - even while expanding its routes at Philadelphia International Airport. That much-larger airport is only about 30 miles from the Delaware airport.\n\nA spokesman for Frontier claimed serving the state was no longer a \"profitable operation\" for Frontier.\n\nAirport general manager Stephen Williams contested that claim, pointing to federal data that showed a record number of passengers using the airport in 2014 and average flights at more than 80% occupancy at the start of 2015.\n\nRegardless, Frontier became the latest of numerous airlines to give up on commercial passenger service at the airport since the 1960s, when it was called the Greater Wilmington Airport.\n\nThe loss also left Delaware as the only state without commercial passenger service.\n\nWhile some airlines have thrived by servicing smaller airports, New Castle's geographic location may put it at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting those carriers, said Jay Sorensen, president of the IdeaWorks Company, an airline consulting firm based in Milwaukee.\n\n\"I would guess that (New Castle Airport) isn't struggling because it's small, but because it's small and next to two very big markets in Philadelphia and Baltimore,\" he told The News Journal in May.\n\nThe DRBA, meanwhile, is still hoping to attract another commercial airline to New Castle.\n\n\"We're always talking to commercial carriers and they're always talking to us,\" Williams said. \"That's a pot that's always on simmer.\"\n\nSalmon insisted the current advertising effort is not a response to Frontier's departure.\n\n\"The two things are not at all related,\" he said. \"We planned this well before they pulled out.\"\n\nWhile commercial air service is important because it brings people and revenue to the airport and the local economy, the facility is much more than passenger flights - something the DRBA is hoping to highlight with its current billboard campaign.\n\n\"An airport is a balance of many activities,\" he said. \"We're working to maintain that balance, while making people aware of the many things that go on behind the fence here.\"\n\nHe noted the airport is home to four fixed-based operators - companies that provide hangar space, fuel, basic maintenance and charter services to the nearly 70 corporate jets and more than 200 privately-owned propeller aircraft based there.\n\nOne of those companies - Dassault Falcon - also operates an aircraft service center where corporate and privately-owned jets receive maintenance, repairs, interior refurbishments and new paint jobs.\n\nTextron Aviation - formerly Hawker Beechcraft - leases a hangar at the airport where the company operates a regional aircraft maintenance facility with close to100 employees.\n\nAnd Flight Safety International operates a training facility there, where more than 200 workers help teach 5,000 corporate jet pilots and maintenance technicians each year. Those students travel to New Castle from around the world to receive instruction on 16 flight simulators - one of the largest of the 50 learning centers the company operates worldwide.\n\nSeveral of those companies, however, said they were unaware of the DRBA's efforts to promote their businesses.\n\nAnd the owner of one questioned the thought process behind the effort.\n\n\"It's not going to do us any good at all to advertise here when most of us at the airport depend on transient customers,\" Aero-Taxi owner Dirk Dinkeloo said.\n\n\"The billboards say, 'look at me,' but don't really say what goes on at the airport and they aren't going to convince anyone to invest in a jet,\" he said. \"I don't know if the DRBA doesn't feel appreciated, but I'd rather they spent the money paving more runway.\"\n\nThe DRBA is undertaking improvements at the airport, thanks in part to federal funding made available by Frontier's presence at the facility.\n\nAirports with at least 10,000 annual boardings are eligible for up to $1 million a year in entitlement grants from the Federal Aviation Administration, while those without are eligible for only $150,000.\n\nThose grants are helping to fund airfield improvements, including a $4.6 million renovation of Taxiway Bravo - one of 10 at the airport - is scheduled to be completed in November. Meanwhile, the DRBA is funding a $3.7 million expansion of the terminal parking lot that will add 200 more spaces by next fall.\n\nThe current billboard campaign - which coincides with the DRBA's 20th anniversary of operating the airport - is set to expire this fall, with two of the advertisements coming down at the end of October, followed by the other two in late November.\n\nBut Stephen Williams, the airport general manager, said future efforts are being planned to further educate the public about the thriving businesses at the airport.\n\n\"We're actually looking at sponsoring events having to do with leisure and education,\" he said. \"That includes promoting all of the careers in the aviation industry that young people may not be aware of.\"\n\nThat type of event has been held at Sussex County's airport each of the last seven years.\n\nThis year's Wings and Wheels festival - a combination air and car show - is expected to draw more than 8,000 people to Georgetown on Oct. 2-3. The event will include an Aviation Education Day where high school students will get a chance to talk with employers in the state's aviation industry.\n\nWhile the airport in New Castle County seeks to pursue similar programs, it remains to be seen whether the DRBA also will follow the downstate airport's recent rebranding campaign.\n\nIn June, the former Sussex County Airport was renamed Delaware Coastal Airport - a moniker county officials say better captures the facility's popularity among tourists.\n\n\"A name change is something we've discussed from time to time,\" said Samuel E. Lathem, one of six DRBA commissioners appointed by Delaware's governor.\n\n\"It's not anything we've talked about lately,\" he said. \"But the idea is out there.\"\n\nThe News Journal of Wilmington, Del., is owned by Gannett, parent company of\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n.

They said the new arena, 76 Place, is anticipated to cost approximately $1.3 billion.\n\nThe location is a busy downtown area with lots of shopping and entertainment and it is near popular Philadelphia destinations such as the Reading Terminal Market.\n\n“The Philadelphia 76ers are a storied Philadelphia institution with a proven track record of investing in their community. That’s why we’re committed to building a world-class home in the heart of the city and creating a privately funded arena that strengthens ties within the local community through investments that prioritize equity, inclusivity and accessibility,” Harris said in a news release.\n\nThe site was selected primarily due to its access to transit, the release said.

It will be located on Delaware Avenue, between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Harbor Boulevard.\n\nThe Sixers will continue to play their home games at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.\n\nThe incentive package provided by New Jersey was “integral to the decision to locate the largest and most advanced facility in the league” in Camden, the team said in a statement.\n\n“Today marks another significant step toward making the Philadelphia 76ers a premier destination for the best players and executives in the league,” Sixers managing owner Josh Harris said. “We are committed to building an elite team and a top priority in pursuit of that goal is the new Training Center, one which will define our culture and is befitting of an organization that strives for excellence in every area.”\n\nThe Sixers have rented space and practiced at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, approximately 10 miles from the Wells Fargo Center, since 1999.\n\nThe Camden facility, approximately eight miles from the arena, will be more than twice as large as the one originally being planned by the team. In June, Sports Business Journal reported that the Sixers were soliciting proposals from architects to construct a 55,000-square-foot practice facility at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, about a mile from the arena, slated to open in June 2015 and with an estimated cost of $20 million to $25 million.\n\nBut those plans changed in September, when New Jersey passed the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, providing significant tax incentives to attract business and spur development.\n\n“This marks the culmination of an exhaustive and collaborative effort, which would not have been feasible without the New Jersey Economic Development Authority incentive package,” Sixers CEO Scott O’Neil said in the release. “The new 76ers Training Center speaks volumes about the vision and commitment of our ownership group, led by Josh Harris and David Blitzer. I would like to recognize and offer a special thanks to [Camden] Mayor Dana Redd, the EDA and Coopers Ferry Partnership for their tireless efforts and assistance in making this project a reality. We are focused on improving every facet of the organization and this is a big step on that journey.”\n\nSixers coach Brett Brown has been vocal about the importance of building a state-of-the-art training facility to better suit the team’s needs and attract top tier free agents, and has said the team’s intent to construct the facility factored heavily in his decision to accept the job last summer.\n\n“It is imperative we are able to provide our players, coaches and staff with the resources necessary for success,” Sixers co-managing owner David Blitzer said. “This facility – the size and scope of which will be unmatched in the NBA – will allow our team to make great strides on and off the court as we work to join the league's elite.”\n\nPhiladelphia-based real estate services company AthenianRazak will serve as the development manager for the project and help to design and erect the facility. Philadelphia-based contractor INTECH Construction is the project’s construction manager.

A rebuild expected to take far longer suddenly sped up.\n\n\"The fact that we’re involved in this, in every sense, I think it’ll speed up our process of getting better,\" Atkinson said before the game. \"There’s nothing like it. There’s nothing like experiencing this.\"\n\nBut now Atkinson's Nets are in a hole after losing 131-115 to the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night inside an electric Barclays Center.\n\nPlaying without Joel Embiid, who was ruled out about 15 minutes before tip-off because of the knee tendinitis that's hindered him for weeks, the Sixers showed off the rest of their weapons.\n\nWeapons that were just too much for Brooklyn to handle.\n\nBen Simmons finished with 31 points and nine assists, Tobias Harris had 29 points and 16 boards while J.J. Redick finished with 26 points.\n\nCaris LeVert was tremendous for the Nets to finish with 26 points while D'Angelo Russell also had 26.\n\nThe Nets need a victory in Game 4 on Saturday to avoid falling into a two-game deficit before the series moves back to Philadelphia.\n\n\"I think we have to look at everything,\" Atkinson said. \"It starts defensively in terms of what we have to do. I think we look at lineups. It's only 1-2. We come back here Saturday and if we win, it's a different series.\"\n\nAnd it remains to be seen if Embiid will be available.\n\nMORE FROM THE NBA PLAYOFFS\n\nThe Nets had no answer for the center in the first two games. Embiid recorded a double-double in Game 2 while throwing an elbow at Nets center Jarrett Allen's mouth that drew a flagrant foul.\n\nGreg Monroe started in place of Embiid on Thursday and had trouble slowing down Allen early. The Nets got off to a quick start, but it didn't last long before the Sixers took control and went up by 10 in the second quarter.\n\nThen LeVert went off, scoring three straight baskets to cut the Nets' deficit to four, prompting Sixers coach Brett Brown to call a timeout.\n\nThat was only the start. LeVert finished the second with 19 points to keep the Nets close.\n\nBut Brooklyn's defense was just too porous. The Sixers aggressively went to the basket and Harris drained three triples in the quarter to keep Philly on top.\n\nThe Sixers carried a six-point lead into halftime, and then expanded it to 15 midway through the third quarter.\n\nBrooklyn still hung around.\n\nWith about 50 seconds left in the quarter, Spencer Dinwiddie, who had 15 points, drained a 3 from the right corner and was fouled by Redick.\n\nHe made the free throw to convert the four-point play and cut the Nets' deficit to 11.\n\nThen Dinwiddie made a layup to cut it to single digits before LeVert stole the ball from Simmons and made a fast-break basket to make it 97-90 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Sixers just proved too difficult to slow down.\n\nJimmy Butler and Simmons went to work in the final period, with Simmons converting a three-point play with just more than five minutes left to put Philadelphia back up by 12.\n\nThen about a minute later, Simmons threw down a high-flying dunk that pushed the Sixers' lead to 15 to virtually lock up the game and silence a raucous crowd.\n\n\"I give Ben a tremendous amount of credit,\" Sixers coach Brett Brown said. \"We needed it all tonight, especially without Joel.\"\n\nAfter a dreadful Game 1, the Sixers have now played two stellar games.\n\nWith their 51-point third-quarter explosion in Game 2 and Thursday's performance despite not having Embiid, they've managed to take control of the series.\n\nThe Sixers showed their firepower in Game 3.

It’s who I am,” she tweeted in August last year.\n\nLady of learning\n\nJill Biden, née Jacobs, was born in the New Jersey town of Hammonton on 3 June 1951, but spent her childhood in Willow Grove, a northern suburb of Philadelphia. The eldest of five daughters, she described herself as “that girl from Philly” - a label that “if you’re from Philadelphia”, you know means she’s “down-to-earth, but also tough”, Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at New Jersey’s Rutgers University-Camden, told Vox.\n\nThe future first lady married her first husband, Bill Stevenson, in 1970 before going on to study at the University of Delaware. She graduated with a degree in English in 1975, the same year that she and Stevenson divorced.\n\nAfter a stint as a high-school English teacher, she completed a master’s degree in education specialising in reading at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, and then a master’s of arts in English from the state’s Villanova University.\n\nFollowing years working in community colleges, as well as a psychiatric hospital, she was also received a doctorate in educational leadership from the University of Delaware in 2007.\n\nThe Johnsons host the Bidens in Cornwall\n\nFor better or for worse\n\nThe 44-year marriage between Joe and Jill “hasn’t always been a straightforward fairytale romance��, Vogue noted during the former’s stint as VP. His first wife, college sweetheart Neilia, and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident in 1972. His sons Beau and Hunter were also in the car but survived.\n\nThe future US leader met Jill three years later, according to the White House - although her first husband told the Daily Mail last year that he suspected she had cheated on him with Biden, with the alleged affair dating back to at least August 1974. Stevenson claimed that he and his then wife had first met Biden while working on his campaign for Senate in 1972.\n\nBut those claims have been refuted by multiple sources, who say the future White House residents first met in 1975 on a blind date set up by the president’s brother.\n\nThe couple married in 1977, although the then-senator had to propose five times before she accepted. Their daughter, Ashley, was born in 1981.\n\nTragedy struck in 2015, however, when Beau Biden died from brain cancer. The politician’s son had battled ill health for years, suffering a stroke in 2010 and undergoing surgery to remove a legion from his brain three years later, shortly before being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nReflecting on her marriage in her 2019 memoir Where the Light Enters: Building a Family, Discovering Myself, Jill wrote that “we have had our hearts wrung and broken”, but added: “One thing in my life has stayed the same: Joe and I have always had each other.”\n\nTriple challenge\n\nDuring her time as second lady, Jill began “tackling a traditional trio” of causes comprising cancer prevention, the military and education, says Philadelphia Magazine.\n\nThe Obamas and the Bidens eat breakfast together on the campaign trail in 2008 (Image credit: Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty Images)\n\nHaving established the Biden Breast Health Initiative in 1993 to educate girls about breast cancer, in 2016 she helped launch the Cancer Moonshot initiative, a national coalition of cancer researchers. The initiative has “yielded rapid progress in the understanding, detection, and treatment of cancer”, reports The Lancet, which is joining calls for the now president to launch Moonshot 2.0 in order to “expand and amplify this progress”.\n\nThe first lady has also authored a children’s book, Don’t Forget, God Bless Our Troops, which was published in 2012 and encourages support of people serving in the military and their families.\n\nAnd the seasoned educator has long championed the role of community colleges in America’s education system. She hosted the first White House Summit on Community Colleges during Barack Obama’s presidency, and as honorary chair of the College Promise National Advisory Board, advocated for making the first two years of college “as free and universal as high school”.\n\nTaking centre stage\n\nAs well as continuing her work for the causes she took up as second lady, along with her teaching job, Jill has spent her first few months as first lady visiting Covid-19 vaccination clinics and healthcare centres across the US, to support for the country’s healthcare workers.\n\nShe is also facing calls to help stamp out the Trumps’ legacy in the White House, with more than 79,000 people signing a petition asking her and second gentleman Doug Emhoff to “restore” the famous Rose Garden to its former pre-Melania design.\n\nAll the same, as a familiar face in US politics, Jill “hasn't received an overwhelming amount of media attention in the same way some of her predecessors did”, says USA Today.\n\nBut “compared to previous first ladies, she’s off to a fast start” , historian Myra Gutin, a professor at New Jersey’s Rider University, told the newspaper. “This is not Jill Biden’s first rodeo - she really does know what goes on at the White House because she had a front-row seat to the first lady's role.”", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Devika Rao", "Harold Maass", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/03/jill-biden-portsmouth-first-lady-celebrates-post-covid-freedom/7841183002/", "title": "Jill Biden in Portsmouth: First Lady celebrates post-pandemic freedom", "text": "Karen Dandaurant\n\nnews@seacoastonline.com\n\nPORTSMOUTH - People were joking that FLOTUS managed to stop the heavy rain that had been predicted for her visit to Portsmouth, and while it wasn't exactly sunny, the umbrellas stayed by everyone's side.\n\nFirst Lady Dr. Jill Biden arrived in Portsmouth, at Portsmouth International Airport at Pease, late Saturday afternoon.

Not that she cared. She was there to check in on victims of last month’s deadly tornadoes, which ripped through Bowling Green, taking down houses, gutting businesses and killing nearly 80 people in the state.\n\nBiden was there as compassionate sweeper, following up on the President’s December visit to the state, during which he said he was in it with Kentuckians “for the long haul,” as long as it took to rebuild. And so here was the first lady, putting that promise to pass. “You have never left our thoughts,” she said during remarks at a local disaster recovery center. “As we held our holiday dinner, as we said our Christmas prayers, the families of Kentucky were on our minds.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Biden capped another of more than two dozen 10-hour days of prep and travel, hustling back to her government jet via motorcade, for the flight out of the 35th state she has visited in the one year she has been first lady. On the plane ride, Biden rallied energy to surprise one of her main Secret Service agents, who after several years was moving from her security detail to another post, with vanilla cupcakes made in the White House pastry kitchen that were topped with the seal of the Secret Service. The first lady walked the length of the plane, like a flight attendant, offering the desserts to all the passengers who had been on the day’s trip but had since separated into different pockets of staff, security, advance, military aides and press.\n\n“She has more stamina than people half her age,” a White House official who has worked closely for several years with Biden, told CNN, on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about their observations.\n\nAt 70, Biden is the oldest sitting first lady in modern American history. (She beats out Bess Truman, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, who were each 67 when they exited the White House.) But follow her around on a trip like the one she took to Kentucky, and it is clear that perhaps unlike the President – whose physical and mental fitness is sometimes questioned, as it was in Wednesday’s press conference – being a septuagenarian does not raise similar questions about the first lady’s capabilities.\n\n“Jill runs circles around everyone. Just ask her husband,” said the official.\n\nAs she closes her first year on the job, Biden is distinct for the fact that she has been, literally and figuratively, all over the map. Where other first ladies have drilled down on one initiative, Biden has scattered her attention on everything from vaccines and education to Joining Forces, which helps support military families, to cancer, the American Rescue Plan, free community college and disaster recovery. It is a frenetic roster, with at times frenetic energy.\n\n“If she seems all over the place, it’s because she has to be all over the place,” said the official. “She is moving with the intensity of a first lady that doesn’t want to waste one day of her time in the White House, but that’s coupled with this massive assignment on top of that, ‘Oh by the way, heal the country from the devastation of a pandemic.’”\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden visits Marvin E. Pratt Elementary School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in September. Evelyn Hockstein/AP\n\nFor Biden, even if she wanted to zero in on one or two top-line initiatives, she couldn’t. She’s too busy being the administration’s live and in-person messenger, holding the literal and figurative hand of Americans getting their vaccines, and now their boosters. “I think the pandemic has eclipsed anything a ‘normal’ first lady would do,” said Kate Andersen Brower, CNN contributor and author of “First Women: the Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies.”\n\nBrower added that the popularity factor enjoyed by former first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush hasn’t caught on for Biden, because of the overshadowing of Covid-19, and the ongoing challenges of a country deeply politically divided. “I think she’s struggling to gain the same level of trust that (Michelle Obama and Laura Bush) had because people are really struggling right now and so much faith in government, and the presidency, has been lost.”\n\n“The ability to brand and launch something like a ‘Let’s Move,’ or even ‘Ready to Read,’ would be an actual luxury at this point,” the official said, referring to the initiatives of Obama and Bush, respectively. “There’s just too much else to do, that she wants to do.”\n\nInside the White House, Biden hasn’t even had time – or the desire – to redecorate the official residence, which most first ladies begin to do within the first six months or so of living there, to make it more akin to their personal tastes. Instead, the Bidens get out of town almost every weekend, frequently hunkering down at their longtime Wilmington, Delaware, home, to recharge and relax. The surroundings there are already familiar, and not the formal opulence of the White House residence, which remains decorated with the pastel palette of former first lady Melania Trump, tinged with a good amount of gold vermeil accessories. Biden, said a person familiar with her feelings about the décor, is happy with how her predecessor chose to enhance the residence and right now is “quite content” living there.\n\nOne year in\n\nIn recent political history, there hasn’t been a first lady who has spread the words of her husband more frequently, actively or consistently than Jill Biden has for Joe Biden. The President has been to 28 states, according to longtime White House correspondent and informal presidential fact-checker Mark Knoller, who meticulously counts such things, versus the first lady’s 35.\n\nAnd despite his vow in Wednesday’s press conference to get out into the country more during his second year in office, Joe Biden hasn’t had the on-the-ground, face-to-face experience Jill Biden has at vaccination clinics, for example, or at listening sessions with parents and teachers about going back into the classroom during the pandemic, as she did in September in Milwaukee, or in hospitals, thanking first responders and medical professionals, as she did in October at a cancer facility in Charleston, South Carolina. She walked into the building with ribbon-tied bags held high above her head, announcing, “I’ve brought cookies from the White House!”\n\nShe begins and ends most public remarks with “Joe and I,” going on to outline something he – and she – are passing along as message of the day, and often tells people in the crowds that come to see her that she will “bring this home and tell Joe.”\n\nDespite the fact that she is an accomplished academic professional with a doctorate in education, who served eight years in training as wife of the vice president and second lady of the United States, Biden’s spin on the job seems to be more personal than policy-focused, casting herself more as a Joe Biden proxy than as an emissary for some remote charitable cause. She is, as people around her often put it, “Just Jill,” out there trying to spread her husband’s platform, collecting feedback he might find useful.\n\nFirst ladies tend to be the softer and more approachable part of a presidential administration. And whether that’s a fair or realistic – or just highly antiquated – description of the job, it cushions them against some of the sharper criticism their husbands often receive. Biden is no exception.\n\n“I think she’s faring better than her husband is, but that’s not hard to do and that’s usually the case,” said Brower, who noted that when then-President George W. Bush’s approval rating was over 50% after the September 11 attacks, Laura Bush’s was even higher.\n\nWhile most Americans might struggle if put on the spot to answer what Jill Biden’s top-line initiatives are, they would likely immediately identify her as a visible, caring and compassionate first lady. “You can’t always say this about every first lady, or every politician for that matter, but every time Jill hugs someone, or holds their hand – that’s authentic,” said the White House official who has worked with Biden both as second lady and now first lady.\n\nBiden greets people at the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center in Charleston in October. Mic Smith/AP\n\nMichael LaRosa, who served as Biden’s press secretary during the 2020 presidential campaign and now holds the same title in the East Wing, recalled several times he witnessed “complete strangers seeking her out and embracing her and telling her their stories.”\n\nThere was the wife of a farmer who told Biden about her husband’s mental breakdown after their family farm flooded twice. And the young man in Iowa she hugged after seeing in his face he was struggling with something; she guessed it was because he was dealing in some way with cancer. “He was upset because both his mother and his best friend were suffering,” said LaRosa. In the car on the snowy drive to the next campaign event, Biden called the man’s friend, who did have cancer, to lift his spirits.\n\n“I think she’s much easier for most Americans to relate to than her predecessor, which is a key part of the job: First ladies need to act as consolers-in-chief,” Brower said. “I think people see her as a more relatable person than her predecessor simply because she smiles and lets down her guard in a way that Melania Trump never did.”\n\nBiden has her sights on more, not less\n\nWith all she has taken on, and the focus she has allotted to each cause, event and platform, those who know Biden and work with her say she wants to scale up, not back.\n\nIn the coming weeks, there will be an announcement about a heightened campaign to fight cancer, said a person with knowledge of her agenda – yet another issue close to Biden’s heart. Biden’s son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\nShe will likely also be deployed to some degree to help with the 2022 midterms. Most first ladies are effective and frequent surrogates for their husband and party, and Democrats are facing an uphill battle to keep control of Congress. LaRosa said at this time there are no specific plans for Biden to campaign.\n\nThere is also a first solo extended foreign trip for the first lady, anticipated for the spring. (Biden traveled to Tokyo in July for a brief appearance to help kick off the Summer Olympics.) There is nothing to officially announce regarding destination or dates at this time, LaRosa said, but travel is expected in March, when Biden is on spring break from her other job – teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nMembers of the first lady’s office traveled to several countries in Africa on a pre-advance trip in September, but no decisions have been made, said a person familiar with White House travel.\n\nHowever, as for a first lady’s branded initiative – Obama launched “Let’s Move” in February 2010 and Trump announced “Be Best” in May 2018 – Biden is not drilling down on a catchy phrase or logo to combine her myriad interests. “It just isn’t on her radar right now to wrap it all up into one thing like other first ladies have done,” said the official.\n\nThat is not to say there isn’t plenty more coming from Biden, who has never signaled she wants to slow down.\n\nA harbinger of more trips, events, appearances and ideas ahead: Biden has just hired a new member of her communications team, two people with knowledge of the hire told CNN. Kelsey Donohue has experience amplifying a first lady’s public profile; she was assistant press secretary and digital strategist for Michelle Obama, and she will do the same for Biden, leading her digital media efforts.\n\n“We’ve operated for most of the past year as a three-person communications shop,” LaRosa told CNN, adding he’s looking forward to Donohue’s addition to what he called a “nimble team.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/10/29/jill-biden-first-lady-veterans-military-vote-column/6056844002/", "title": "Election 2020: As first lady, Jill Biden will support troops, veterans", "text": "Mary Winnefeld\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nAs a bizarre election season approaches its climax, Americans — especially those who remain undecided — are sifting through the stark differences between the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on the ballot. Soon they will make one of the most important voting decisions of their adult lives.\n\nWith that in mind, now is as good a time as ever to point out the often-under-appreciated value to the presidency of having a positively engaged spouse as a teammate. As a former military spouse, I want to tell you how important Dr. Jill Biden was to me personally, and how amazing she will be as our nation’s first lady.\n\nWhen my husband and I arrived in Washington, D.C., in 2011 to begin his tour as the nation’s second-highest ranking military officer, I searched for a way to make a difference for our men and women in uniform and their families. Our nation was still deeply involved in two overseas wars. Many of our servicemembers were coming home with deep physical and mental wounds. Our military families were suffering from many years of extended deployments, an overloaded and under-prepared health care system, and, in too many cases, from the toll of raising kids while serving as caregivers for wounded warriors. I wanted to help.\n\nNot long after arriving in D.C., I learned about Joining Forces, which was launched by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden as a nationwide initiative calling on Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities.\n\nJill Biden knows veterans\n\nBearing an inherent distrust in all things political, I wasn’t sure if this was real. Was this nothing more than window dressing designed to soothe those who might have a distrust for Democratic Party politicians? I quickly discovered how very serious these two women were about helping this underserved group of people.\n\nWorking together, they applied the power of the White House to a bureaucracy that often lacks empathy and is under constant pressure to find savings, which can run counter to doing the right thing for our people. I was privileged to be involved in Joining Forces, and in the process came to know Biden as an incredibly capable and caring woman.\n\nA long way from 'normal':Sorry, there will be no return to normalcy under Joe Biden\n\nWhile much was accomplished under the leadership of Obama and Biden, there is much more work to be done, and a four-year gap in the type of advocacy represented by Joining Forces has not helped. As the spouse of a veteran and the mother of a fourth-generation service member currently serving his country in a war zone, I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by our service members, veterans and their families. Jill Biden has already signaled she will reinvigorate this important White House initiative. I know, I’ve asked her. And she knows what she’s doing.\n\nRestoration of character\n\nSupporting our military and their families is not the only area in which she will excel as first lady. This dedicated teacher will continue serving our country in the classroom. Her empathy, moral compass and willingness to listen will set an example that will help our nation restore civility to our national dialogue. Further, she will be a gracious partner in hosting foreign dignitaries to rebuild relationships with allies and partners that have suffered over the past four years.\n\nPolitics doesn't fit in a suburban box:My 'suburban mom' demographic is supposedly all in for Biden. But I'm voting for Trump.\n\nTo be sure, this election is about our next president, not who will be first lady. There are already ample reasons to favor Joe Biden, most of which — at least for me — involve the pressing need for our children to be able look up to a president of high character, who will bring our wonderful, diverse nation back together.\n\nBut it should not be lost on us that standing firmly by his side is another person of equally high character. Jill Biden is an intelligent, modest, energetic, and compassionate partner who will make a tangible, positive difference for our country as first lady — and we need all the help we can get.\n\nMary Winnefeld is an advocate for veterans, military service members, and their families, and is co-founder of SAFEProject.us, whose mission is to help reverse the nation’s fatal drug overdose epidemic.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/20/read-the-entire-transcript-of-president-joe-bidens-dnc-speech/74867260007/", "title": "Read the entire transcript of President Joe Biden's DNC speech", "text": "President Joe Biden put a bow on the end of night one in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention. He spoke to the crowd gathered in the United Center for just under an hour.\n\nThe convention will last through Thursday and will feature many more headlining speakers like Barack and Michelle Obama, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, former President Bill Clinton and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Everything will conclude with remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris, who will officially accept her nomination for president.\n\nBiden's time on the stage was preceded by a passionate speech from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, remarks from Hillary Clinton and first lady Jill Biden and an appearance from Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden's daughter Ashley Biden introduced him to the stage, saying he was \"the OG girl dad\" and calling on Americans to \"Work harder than you have ever worked before in your life\" this election season.\n\nRead the entire speech from Biden here.\n\nBiden remarks DNC night one:\n\nThat was my daughter!\n\nThank you.\n\nI love you.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “Thank you, Joe”]\n\nI tell you what, to my dearest daughter Ashley. God, love you. You’re incredible. Thank you for the introduction and for being my courageous heart, along with Hunter and our entire family, and especially our rock, Jill. It was those of you who know us, she still leaves me both breathless and speechless. Everybody knows her, I love her more than she loves me. She walks down the stairs, and I still get that going boom, boom, boom. You all who know me, know I’m not kidding.\n\nLet’s give a special round of applause to our first lady Jill Biden.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, for real, he’d say “Joey, family is the beginning, the middle and the end.”\n\nAnd I love you all, folks. And America, I love you!\n\nFolks, let me ask you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to vote for freedom?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAre you ready to vote for democracy and for America?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAs president and vice president of the United States.\n\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly four years ago, in winter, on the steps of the Capitol, on a cold January day I raised my right hand, and I swore on oath to you and to god to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States. In front of me, in front of me, was a city surrounded by the national guard, behind me a capitol just two weeks before had been overrun by a violent mob.\n\nBut I knew then, from the bottom of my heart, that I knew now, there is no place in America for political violence. None. You cannot say you love your country only when you win. In that moment, I wasn’t looking to the past, I was looking to the future.\n\nI spoke to the work at hand. The moment we had to meet, it was, as I told you then, a winter of peril and possibility. Of peril and possibility.\n\nWe were in the grip of a once-in-a-century pandemic, historic joblessness, a call for racial justice long overdue, clear and present threats to our very democracy.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd yet, and yet I believed then, and I believe now, that progress was and is possible just as it is achievable. And our best days are not behind us, they’re before us. Now it’s summer, the winter has passed. And with a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy, democracy has delivered. And now, democracy must be preserved.\n\nYou’ve heard me say it before, we’re facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole; I mean it literally.\n\nWe're in the battle for the very soul of America.\n\nI ran for president in 2020 because of what I saw at Charlottesville in August of 2017. Extremists coming out of the woods, carrying torches, their veins bulging from their necks, carrying Nazi swastikas and chanting the same exact antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early thirties.\n\nNeo-Nazis, white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, so emboldened by a president then in the White House that they saw as an ally. They didn’t even bother to wear their hoods. Hate was on the march in America.\n\nOld ghosts, and new garments, stirring up the oldest divisions, stoking the oldest fears, giving oxygen to the oldest forces that they long sought to tear apart America.\n\nIn the process, a young woman was killed. When I contacted her mother to ask about what happened, she told me. When the president was asked what he thought had happened. Donald Trump said, and I quote, “There were very fine people on both sides.” My god. That’s what he said. That is what he said and what he meant.\n\nThats’s when I realized I had to listen to the admonition of my dead son. I could not stay on the sidelines, so I ran.\n\nI had no intention of running again. I just lost part of my soul, but I ran with a deep conviction. An America I know and believe, and an America where honesty, dignity, decency still matter. An America where everyone has a fair shot, and hate has no safe harbor. An America where the fundamental creed of this nation that all of us are created equal is still very much alive.\n\nAnd a broad coalition of Americans joined with me. 81 million voters voted for us. More than any time in all of history.\n\nBecause of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy. As your president, I been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back, to stand against hate and violence in all its forms, to be a nation where we not only live with but thrive on diversity, demonizing no one, leaving no one behind, and becoming the nation that we professed to be.\n\nI also ran to rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class. I made a commitment to you that I’d be a president for all America, whether you voted for me or not.\n\nWe have done that. Studies show the major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red states than blue, because the job of the president is to deliver to all America.\n\nBecause of you, I’m not exaggerating, because of you, we’ve had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever. Period.\n\nWhen I say we, I mean Kamala and me.\n\nJust think about it. COVID no longer controls our lives. We’ve gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world.\n\nRecord 60 million new jobs, record small business growth, record high stock market, record high 401Ks. Wages up, inflation down, way down, and continuing to go down. The smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years and yes, we both know we have more to do, but we’re moving in the right direction.\n\nMore Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history. And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate low-prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.\n\nAnd guess who cast the tie breaking vote? Vice President, soon to be President, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. Instead of paying $400 a month for insulin seniors with diabetes, will pay $35 a month. The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every seniors’ total prescription cost can be capped at $2,000, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.\n\nAnd what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.\n\nYou know what we just passed saved? It saved $160 billion dollars over the next decade.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices ... to the big pharma.\n\nBut look, folks. Thank you, Kamala, too. Look.\n\nFolks, how can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world?\n\nDonald Trump promised infrastructure week every week for four years, and he never built a damn thing.\n\nBut now because of Kamala and I’ve done, remember we’re told we couldn’t get it done, remember when we came into office, we couldn’t get anything passed?\n\nBut right now, we’re giving America an infrastructure decade, not week.\n\nWe’re modernizing, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our trains, our buses.\n\nRemoving every lead pipe from schools and homes so every child can drink clean water. Providing affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where they live. Unlike, not unlike, what Roosevelt did with electricity.\n\nAnd so much more. We are uniting the country. We're growing our economy. We're improving our quality of life and we’re building a better America. Because that’s who we are.\n\nHow can we be the strongest nation in the world, without leading the world in science and technology?\n\nAfter years of importing 90% of our semiconductor chips from abroad, which America invented those chips. Our CHIPS and Science Act meant the private companies from around the world are now investing literally 10’s of billions of dollars to build new chip factories right here in America. And over that period, they’ll create tens of thousands of jobs. And many of those jobs, so-called fabs, the buildings that make those chips, are being constructed now.\n\nAnd guess what? The average salary in those fabs, the size of a football field, will be over $100,000 a year and you don’t need a college degree.\n\nBecause of you and so many electeds out there, American manufacturing is back. Where those to say we wouldn’t lead the world in manufacturing? 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Our Republican friends, and others, made sure they’d go abroad to get the cheapest labor. We used to import products and export jobs, now we export American products and create American jobs. Right here in America, where jobs belong.\n\nWith every new job, with every new factory, pride and hope is being brought back to communities throughout the country that were left behind. You know, you’re from them many of you, you know what it’s like when that factory closed, where your mother, your father, your grandmother, grandfather worked, and now you’re back, providing once again, proving that Wall Street didn’t built America, the middle class built America and unions, unions built the middle class.\n\nIt's been my view since I came to the Senate. That's why I’m proud to have been the first president to walk the picket line and be labeled the most pro-union president in history. And I accept it. It's a fact. Because when unions do well, we all do well.\n\nYou got it man, you got it.\n\nI agree. I’m proud.\n\nLook, remember we were told we couldn’t get anything done. We couldn't get anything done in the Congress. Well with your support, we passed the most significant climate law in the history of mankind.\n\nFor $370 billion dollars, cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, launching a climate corps, similar to AmeriCorps or Peace Corps creating tens of thousands of jobs for young people in the future who are going to make sure this continues.\n\nCreating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy for American workers including the IBW installing 500,000, 500,000 charging stations all across America.\n\nAnd in the process, reducing carbon emissions, and we’re seeing it, we’re seeing to it that the first beneficiaries environmental issues are those fence lines communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution. Louisiana and Delaware, Route nine, all the factories, all those chemical factories are right next to the poorest neighborhoods. They’re the ones we’re going to bring back.\n\nAnd how, how can we be the greatest nation in the world without the best education system in the world?\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican friends, that not only they can't think they can’t read very well. Seriously, think about it.\n\nLook at their Project 2025. Want to do away with the Department of Education.\n\nWell during the pandemic, Kamala helped states and cities get back their get back their schools back open, and we gave public school teachers a raise, we created apprenticeships with businesses in the communities, putting students on path, to a good paying job, whether or not they go to college.\n\nAnd by the way, we’re making college a hell of a lot more affordable. Increasing Pell grants by $900. Over $15 billion dollars for HBCUs, minority service, including Hispanic institutions and tribal colleges.\n\nWe kept our commitment to provide more student relief than ever by lifting the burden of helping millions of families so they could get married, start a family, buy a home and begin to build family wealth and contribute to the community, and grow our economy.\n\nIt's not costing us, it’s creating more wealth.\n\nWe fundamentally transformed how our economy grows. From the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down.\n\nYou know, my dad used to say there wasn’t a whole hell of a lot to drop down on my kitchen table at the end of the month. I come from basic middle-class family: Three-bedroom house, four kids, a grandpop living with us, decent neighborhood, but never a penny to spare. And look, that top-down notion, it never worked. Lota Democrats didn’t think it worked, thought it worked, but it doesn’t.\n\nAnd when we did all that, what we’ve done, everybody could do well. Everybody. Donald Trump calls America a failing nation.\n\n[Crowd boos]\n\nNo, I’m serious. Think about this. Think about this.\n\nHe publicly, he says to the whole world.\n\nI’m going to say something outrageous, I know more foreign leaders by their first names than and know them well than anybody alive just because I’m so damn old.\n\nAnd I’m not joking.\n\nThink of the message he sends around the world, when he talks about America being a failing nation. He says we’re losing. He’s the loser. He’s dead wrong. Many of you are very successful people who travel the world.\n\nName me a country in the world that doesn’t think we’re the leading nation in the world.\n\nWithout America, not a joke, think about it, I’m being literal, who could lead the world other than the United States of America? Well guess what? America’s winning and the world’s better off for it.\n\nAmerica is more prosperous, and Americans are safer today than under Donald Trump.\n\nTrump continues to lie about crime in America, like everything else.\n\nGuess what? On his watch, the murder rate went up 30%, the biggest increase in history. Meanwhile, we made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety, ever. Now, the murder rate is falling faster than any time in history.\n\nViolent crime has dropped to the lowest level in more than 50 years. And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the oval office instead of a convicted felon.\n\nFolks, distinguished senator from the Senate from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.\n\nAnd what makes me ashamed when I travel the world, which I do, more children in America are killed by a gunshot than any other cause in the United States. More die from a bullet than cancer, accidents, than anything else in the United States of America. My god. That’s why Kamala and I are proud, we beat the NRA and we passed the first major bipartisan gun-safety law in 30 years.\n\nI'm serious. That comes from here. And now it’s time to ban assault weapons again.\n\n[Crowd cheers]\n\nAnd demand universal background checks. It’s hard, I never thought I’d stand before a crowd of Democrats and refer to a president as a liar so many times. No, I’m not trying to be funny. It’s sad.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you. Trump killed the strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States. That we negotiated with the Senate Republicans, took four weeks.\n\nOnce it passed, and everybody acknowledged most expansive border change in history, he called senators to say, “Don’t support the bipartisan bill.” He said, “It would help me politically and hurt him politically.” My god. No, I’m serious. Think about it. Not a joke.\n\nNot trying to be funny, but it's sad that Trump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you: Trump killed the largest, strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States that we negotiated with Senate Republicans in just four weeks. Once it passed and acknowledged the border change in American history, he called Senators and said, \"Don’t support the bipartisan Senate bill.\" He said it would help me politically and hurt him politically. My God. Seriously, think about it—it’s not a joke. Even ask the press who don’t like me, and they’ll tell you that’s true.\n\nTypically Trump, once again putting himself first and America last. Then I had to take executive action. As a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office. And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they are \"poisoning the blood of America\" or \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting Dreamers and more.\n\nAnd here’s what else I believe in: protecting your freedom — your freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love, and your freedom to choose. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that you heard earlier tonight — the U.S. Supreme Court majority wrote the following: \"Women are not without electoral or political power.\" No kidding. MAGA Republicans found out the power of women in 2022, and Donald Trump is going to find out the power of women in 2024. Watch.\n\nAnd Trump’s MAGA Republican right-wingers seek to erase history. We Democrats continue to write history and make more history. I’m proud. I’m proud to have kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a symbol for every young woman in America that you can do anything. I’m proud I kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and that taps into the full talent of our nation. The most diverse Cabinet in history, including the first Black woman of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President — and who will soon serve as the 47th President of the United States. She is good.\n\nLook... thank you, Kamala (chanting). Folks, I’ve long said we have many obligations as a nation, but I got in trouble years ago for saying I make no apologies. We have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home — and when they don’t. That’s why I’m so proud to have written and signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever helping veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials like burn pits and Agent Orange.\n\nI was around during the Vietnam War. It’s hard — no one was able to prove that their illness was a consequence of Agent Orange, and no one was able to prove initially that because they lived near burn pits, like my son did in Iraq for a year, that it was the cause of their illness. But because of the PACT Act, a surviving spouse with two children is now eligible for a stipend of about $3,000 a month, and those children who lost a parent are eligible for tuition benefits to go to college and get job training. It’s already helping over 1 million veterans and their families so far. Well, I love them, and I’m so proud of my son’s service. We get it.\n\nGuess who doesn’t get it and doesn’t respect our veterans? We know from his own chief of staff, four-star General John Kelly, that Trump, when in Europe, would not go to the gravesites in France of the brave service members who gave their lives for this country. He called them \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" Who in the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? Those are not the words of a person worthy of being Commander-in-Chief — period. Not then, not now, not ever. I mean that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Just as no Commander-in-Chief should ever bow down to a dictator the way Trump bows down to Putin.\n\nI never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris never will. We will never bow down. When Trump left office, Europe and NATO were in tatters. Not a joke. The \"America First\" doctrine changed our whole image in the world. Well, I spent — they gave the hours, about 190 hours total — my counterparts, heads of state in Europe, to strengthen NATO. We did. We united Europe like it hadn’t been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO. Ten days before he died, Henry Kissinger called and said, \"Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at Russia with dread.\"\n\nWell, guess what? Putin thought he'd take Kyiv in three days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free! When I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. They haven't. No one's saying that now!\n\nWe'll keep working to bring hostages home, end the war in Gaza, and bring peace and security to the Middle East. As you know, I wrote a peace treaty for Gaza. A few days ago, I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to that goal than we've been since October 7th.\n\nWe're working around the clock, my Secretary of State and I, to prevent a wider war, reunite hostages with their families, and surge humanitarian aid, health services, and food assistance into Gaza now. To end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people, and finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire in this war.\n\nThose protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides. Just as we worked around the clock to bring home wrongfully detained Americans and others from Russia, in one of the most complicated swaps in history, but they're home. Kamala and I are going to keep working to bring all Americans wrongfully detained around the world home. I mean it.\n\nFolks, I've got five months left in my presidency. I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done. It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. I love the job, but I love my country more.\n\nAll those people who said I should step down, that's not true. We love our country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. In 2024, we need you to vote. We need you to keep the Senate. We need you to win back the House of Representatives. We need you to beat Donald Trump.\n\nKamala and Tim, President and Vice President of the United States of America. Look, they'll continue to lead America forward, creating more jobs, standing up for workers, growing the economy, lowering the costs to American families so they just have a little more breathing room. We've made incredible progress with more work to do.\n\nKamala and Tim will continue to take on corporate greed and bring down the cost of insulin to $35 a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. They'll cap prescription drug costs at a total of $2,000, not just for seniors, but for everyone. And folks, that's going to save Americans tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFolks, they'll make housing more affordable, building 3 million new homes, providing $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, more than the $10,000 we approved. Donald Trump wants new taxes on imported goods, food, gas, clothing, and more. You know what that would cost the average family, according to the experts? $3,900 a year in taxes. No, that's just a fact. Kamala and Tim will make the child care tax credit permanent, lifting millions of children out of poverty and helping millions of families get ahead.\n\nAnd you know what Trump did? He created the largest debt any president has in four years with his $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. Well, Trump has a new plan. He wants to provide a $5 billion tax cut for corporations that are very wealthy. Read it. It would put us further in debt. And folks, you know we have 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? 8.2%. If we just increase their taxes, as we proposed, to 25%, which isn't even the highest tax rate, it would raise $500 billion new dollars over 10 years. And they'd still be very wealthy. Look, Kamala and Tim are going to make them pay their fair share.\n\nThey'll protect Social Security and Medicare. Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Kamala and Tim will protect your freedom. They'll protect your right to vote. They'll protect your civil rights. And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh, he will. You know Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can to stop him. And that's why you have to elect senators and representatives who will restore Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe ancient Greeks taught us that character is destiny. Character is destiny. For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug are people of character. It's been our honor to serve alongside them. And we know that Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character. Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made in my whole career.\n\nNow that we've gotten to know each other, we've become close friends. She's tough. She's experienced. And she has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best presidents, she was also vice president. But she'll be a president our children can look up to. She'll be a president respected by world leaders because she already is. She'll be a president we can all be proud of. And she will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\n\nThis will be the first presidential election since January 6th. On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country. And that threat, this is not hyperbole, that threat is still very much alive. Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. Think about that. He's promising a bloodbath if he loses, in his words. And that he'll be a dictator on day one, in his own words. By the way, this sucker means it. No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Anybody else said that in the past, you'd think he was crazy, you'd think it was an exaggeration, but he means it. We can't let that happen.\n\nFolks, all of us carry a special obligation: Independents, Republicans, Democrats. We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024. The vote each of us casts this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail. It's that simple. It's that serious. The power is literally in your hands. History is in your hands. Not hyperbole. It's in your hands. America's future is in your hands.\n\nLet me close with this. Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter and modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, grow up to sit behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. That's because America is, and always has been, a nation of possibilities. Possibilities. We must never lose that. Never.\n\nKamala and Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities. Not just for a few of us, but for all of us. Join me in dedicating your whole heart to this effort. And with all my heart, I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz camp have ever seen.\n\nEach of us has our own American story. For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us. It captures the best of who we are as a nation. The song is called \"American Anthem.\" There's one verse that stands out, and I can't sing worth a damn, so I'm not going to try. I'll just quote it: \"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart, when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.\"\n\nI've made a lot of mistakes in my career. But I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation. And I've been blessed a million times in return for the support of the American people. I really have been too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet, and now I'm too old to stay as president. But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nI can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, giving my word as a Biden: I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States Senator. I mean it.\n\nFolks, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America! And there's nothing we cannot do when we do it together.\n\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/02/first-lady-jill-biden-defends-2024-campaign-vogue/74279831007/", "title": "First lady Jill Biden defends Joe Biden in new Vogue profile", "text": "First lady Jill Biden is fiercely defending her husband, President Joe Biden, days after a stumbling and potentially costly televised performance.\n\nThe president faced off Thursday against former President Donald Trump in a historic presidential debate that left many Democrats anxious about his bid for reelection. The first lady is on the cover of this month's Vogue magazine, published Monday.\n\n“If people knew what Joe’s done ...” Jill Biden told Vogue. “If they knew all of that −I mean, the bridge is being built in their city and they don’t know who did it. They don’t know who’s getting the lead out of their water. They don’t know who’s stopping the pipeline going through the parklands.

She said then they \"will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he’s been president\" and \"will continue to fight,\" according to an editor's note in the Vogue piece.\n\nThe note added that she will remain the president's \"closest confidant.\"\n\n“People don’t mention her when they talk about Biden’s key advisers,\" New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers told Vogue, \"but she’s his gut check.\"\n\nRogers continued, \"And she really believes in her husband’s ability to get things done for the American people—whether they’re his supporters or not. That’s why she’s fighting so hard for him to get a second term.\"\n\nFollowing his rocky debate performance, Democrats have privately and publicly mulled whether Biden should continue as their party's presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nNBC News reported Saturday that the decision is \"deeply personal and familial\" for the Bidens and ultimately, he will take his cue from her.\n\n“If she decides there should be a change of course, there will be a change of course,\" a source told NBC.\n\nStumping for the president with key electorates\n\nThe first lady has been an active adviser throughout Biden's time in office, Vogue reports.\n\n“Really, in so many different areas,” she told the magazine, “I tell him what I’m seeing, what I’m hearing − and he gets it. And this is where the magic happens.”\n\nJill Biden has been particularly hands on in the administration while leading the White House's initiative on women's health research.\n\nAnd on the 2024 trail, Vogue reports she acts as the campaign's empathetic ear and a spokesperson to women voters, a voting bloc the president will need to secure a win this November.\n\n“Look, I know that food prices are up,” Jill Biden told Vogue. “I go to the grocery store when I’m in Wilmington. And I raised three kids, and did the food shopping for how many years before we got to this job? It’s not like I don’t know.”\n\nThe first lady appeared in Minneapolis earlier this year to rally the state's Women for Biden chapter, appealing to charged issues including reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\n“We are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,” she reportedly told the crowd at the time. “Book bans.

Prior to Biden's announcement, the DNC had decided to confirm their nominee during a virtual roll call sometime before Aug. 7 to satisfy ballot deadlines in several states.\n\nDNC members are set to meet Wednesday to discuss the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nWho could become the nominee?\n\nBiden's announcement to drop out took place just over 100 days out from the Nov. 5 election, when he planned to take on Trump.\n\nThe president officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the next Democratic nominee.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President, in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission, changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThat makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign assuming control of Biden’s campaign money. It also allows Harris to begin raising money for her own presidential bid.\n\nIn a statement the same day Biden made his historic announcement, former President Barack Obama praised Biden’s decision to end his campaign, saying he selflessly put America's interests ahead of his own. Obama’s statement made no mention of Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\nShortly after Biden announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race, in a phone interview with CNN, Trump said he expects to run against Harris, and predicted he would win.\n\nWho are the other options?\n\nIn addition to Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have all also been floated as possible replacements. All have been Biden supporters and campaign surrogates who were working to help get him reelected.\n\nMarianne Williamson is technically still in the race after unsuspending her campaign in late February.

Advisers are already preparing the president’s annual State of the Union address, typically delivered in late January or early February, viewing the speech as an opportunity to lay down the stakes and themes that Biden could adopt on the campaign trail.\n\nThe first couple arrived in St. Croix on Tuesday, along with family members, a gathering of the tight-knit clan who, according to several people with knowledge of recent conversations who have spoken to CNN, have now pledged support for another White House run by Biden. Senior administration officials once viewed this week’s tropical escape as a crucial juncture that would play a major part in deciding his political future, and – while the president does still plan to mull with his family the pros and cons of mounting a reelection bid – people who have discussed the matter with him lately say the decision is essentially made.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN Exclusive: Pelosi and Schumer say Biden should run for re-election in 2024 02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nClues that Biden was expected in St. Croix were everywhere in the run-up to his arrival: the jumbo C-17 transport planes sitting among the puddle jumpers at the airport; temporary security checkpoints among the bougainvillea along the quiet coastal road; unusually high numbers of visitors from Washington.\n\nEven for a popular tourist destination accustomed to a wave of winter travelers, this week’s presidential visit has maxed out the island’s resources. Rental cars were all taken, and hotels were at capacity, according to residents.\n\nAfter the Bidens skipped the US Virgin Islands tradition the last two years, this trip may have some of the same vibes as one of their more recent vacations. In the early hours of 2019, when Biden was last contemplating a presidential bid, the couple were photographed taking a selfie at Point Udall in St. Croix on New Year’s Day, catching the first sunrise of the new year at the easternmost point under the American Flag, as the popular tourist spot is known.\n\nA decision had been made. Several months later, Biden would announce his candidacy for the presidency.\n\nPrivacy, please\n\nIn 2014, Joe and Jill Biden enjoyed their time on the island so much, they visited St. Croix twice – once to ring in the new year and again for a weekend in March, a quick getaway trip not on the then-vice president’s official schedule.\n\nIn 2015, the couple again passed the week after Christmas there, after deciding he would not run for the White House.\n\nIn 2016, Bidens spent the waning days of his vice presidency relaxing on St. Croix, ahead of Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House.\n\nBiden’s loyalty to the US territory has been the most high-profile of any American politician in recent history. A sitting American president has not visited St. Croix since Harry S. Truman in 1948. Truman arrived by yacht – the USS Williamsburg – and was hosted at an estate owned by the manufacturer of Jeeps.\n\nIn 1997, President Bill Clinton visited neighboring St. Thomas, another of the US Virgin Islands, for his winter vacation, chartering a catamaran with his family and snorkeling with daughter Chelsea.\n\nIn a 2020 statement, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said of Biden, “We consider him our hometown president.” Asked why the Bidens have picked St. Croix as their island getaway, Vanessa Valdivia, the first lady’s press secretary, told CNN, “Over the years, the president and first lady have frequently traveled to a warmer location the week after Christmas, going to the US Virgin Island several times.”\n\nFor the entirety of his presidency, Biden has skipped out when he can on weekends in Washington, DC, in favor of his longtime family home in Wilmington, Delaware, where residence staff and storied rooms aren’t a thing.\n\nSt. Croix, for the first couple, has provided that sort of intense privacy, plus the warmth and beach that the Bidens favor.\n\nDuring their visits in the years after Biden served as vice president, when his security apparatus dwindled and normalcy found a return to their daily routine, the first couple could be spotted around the island on occasion with virtually no entourage, driving themselves along the flower-lined roads in a rental Toyota sedan.\n\nThe home they leased was modest – only a few bedrooms – and was available at other times of the year for other tourists on vacation rental websites.\n\nYet on Tuesday, law enforcement was busy in the same area making preparations for Biden’s visit, including setting up flood lights and popping up white tents to act as checkpoints along the roadside.\n\nThe Bidens are staying at the home of his friends Bill and Connie Neville in St. Croix, the White House says. The president and first lady have stayed at the home of the tech executive on previous visits to the island.\n\nBeach people\n\nThe first couple are “beach people,” said a family friend familiar with their vacation preferences. Others who know them well said there is little more they enjoy when relaxing than pitching an umbrella on the beach, tossing a towel onto the sand and closing their eyes under a warm sun.\n\nTheir Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, neighbors are now used to being screened by Secret Service agents during beach walks, the telltale signal the president and/or first lady have walked down from their oceanside vacation residence to the beach for a respite closer to the waves.\n\nThe first lady, in particular, finds peace in her books and soaking up the sun. This spring, staff for Jill Biden – on a solo, whirlwind, three-country visit to Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – made sure to schedule private time for the first lady beside the pool at a resort out of Panama City, so she could lay out like dozens of other vacationers, steps from the waterside.\n\n“They both prefer hot and sunny and humid to wet and snowy and cold,” said another close acquaintance of the Bidens.\n\nFor the first couple, a true respite involves privacy as well, not just sun and warmth. St. Croix has fit the checklist. Locals have spotted the couple in years past at the grocery store, going mostly unnoticed as they shopped for vacation provisions at Seaside Market and Deli. Joe Biden has played rounds of golf at the Buccaneer Resort, a par-70 course described as “challenging, yet very playable” on the property’s website.\n\nThey have attended mass at the white-steepled Holy Cross Catholic Church in the island’s main town Christiansted.\n\nReelection discussions on the island\n\nThe break from Washington comes on the heels of a busy holiday season. Jill Biden – so tasked with dozens of White House celebrations, photo lines, family visits and general hosting duties that she had laryngitis for several days – is on her second week off from her teaching duties at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nFor Joe Biden, the stakes of getting away are not just about rest and recuperation.\n\nBarring unforeseen events or a sudden change of heart, Biden’s team is laying the groundwork for a reelection announcement in the coming months, putting to rest persistent speculation about whether the 80-year-old president would seek another term.\n\nCNN has reported that Jill Biden is “all in” on the 2024 campaign despite previous concerns about the deep implications of what a second run might mean for her family and her husband. She has, as one White House official told CNN, “zero concerns” about Joe Biden’s schedule and stamina.\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAside from the rigors of launching the final political campaign of his career, Biden will face a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, intent on stymieing many of his legislative ambitions. Republican leaders have also vowed to mount investigations into Biden’s administration and his family.\n\nWith his legislative prospects dampened, Biden plans to travel extensively in the new year promoting the accomplishments from his first two years in office. It will be an intense period that could ultimately include a rematch with his 2020 opponent, Trump – and one that will require the full backing of his wife of 45 years, along with the support of his extended family.\n\nIf there is a time to speak up on hesitations, either his own or from his offspring, it would be during this vacation.\n\nWayne Nichols, who leads Alexander Hamilton tours of St. Croix in the character of the founding father, recalled a 2019 encounter he had with Biden, with whom he engaged while the then-not-quite-presidential candidate was walking alone on the east end of the island.\n\nAt the time, Biden was also mulling a daunting campaign. After passing on a bid in 2016 following the death of his son, he was being encouraged by his family to mount a challenge to Trump.\n\nNichols said he stopped Biden to ask if he would run.\n\n“My question to him was, ‘Well, you’re going to run?’ He goes, ‘Well, I’m running now.’ And I thought, well, technically you’re walking,” Nichols recalled this week, wondering whether he might again cross paths with Biden.\n\nNichols came across Joe Biden a second time that week in 2019, while out for a walk on the island – Joe Biden up front, Jill Biden walking a few paces behind – when someone in the group told Jill Biden that her husband ought to run for president.\n\n“‘When you get up there, let him know that,’” Nichols said she responded.\n\nAs the Bidens make similar deliberations this year, they won’t be getting around in a rented Toyota and their stops on the island will go less unnoticed.\n\n“I have a feeling this is the place,” Nichols said of Biden often choosing St. Croix as his spot to find stillness for a consequential decision about the future. “Chilling there by the water with the nice weather. They get to talk about it. And I believe he’ll run again, only because I don’t know that he thinks there’s any alternative.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett Kevin Liptak", "Kate Bennett", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/29/floridians-recount-firsthand-experiences-joe-biden/6425216002/", "title": "Floridians recount firsthand experiences with Joe Biden", "text": "As a man who's run for president three times over the last 33 years, Joe Biden knows Florida. And a good chunk of Floridians know the president-elect.\n\nSome of those who have met Biden recount him as caring, gracious and statesmanlike. Their depictions of Biden vary little despite decades of interactions.\n\nKathleen Crotty remembers meeting both Joe and Jill Biden on July 25, 1986. Her father, the late Ambassador Bill Crotty, was a major Democratic Party fundraiser and he hosted the Bidens that night at the old Treasure Island resort in Daytona Beach Shores.\n\n\"I was very, very pregnant,at the time,\" Crotty said recently. \"A lot of times going to a party, everybody dressed up. ... (Joe Biden) was gracious with me.\"\n\nT. Wayne Bailey, the Stetson professor emeritus of political science at Stetson University, was there, as well. Biden won't go down in history as a particularly eloquent speech-maker, Bailey said.\n\n\"I do remember he would reach over when he saw you and give a handshake and put an arm around your shoulder. He was very friendly. ... He was like one of us.\"\n\nAnd Crotty recalls Jill Biden as \"lovely.\" Crotty and the future first lady-elect sat down and had a conversation about education.\n\n\"That's the only thing that gives kids a chance to do more than what they were born with,\" said Crotty, who's a long-practicing attorney in Daytona Beach. \"I really think we're going to have a great first lady.\"\n\nCareer in Senate\n\nJoe Biden first became a U.S. senator representing Delaware in 1973.\n\nBailey said he remembers taking Stetson students to the U.S. Capitol for a seminar in the late 1970s or early 1980s and Biden was among the Senators willing to meet with the group.\n\n\"He was very approachable. ... He liked to visit with small groups,\" Bailey said. \"He liked the conversational approach.\"\n\nBiden first ran for president in 1987. Along with eventual nominee Michael Dukakis and five others, Biden was dubbed as one of the \"Seven Dwarfs,\" Democrats seeking the 1988 nomination, but he dropped out months ahead of the primaries after news reports surfaced accusing him of plagiarizing several speeches including one by Neil Kinnock, the British Labour Party leader.\n\nWhile Biden had given similar speeches crediting the source, Dukakis operatives supplied reporters with an example where Biden had not mentioned Kinnock, and 1987 was a different time in presidential politics. Even some mini-scandals meant the end for candidates.\n\n\"I've done some dumb things,\" Biden said as he announced his departure from the race. \"And I'll do dumb things again.\"\n\nHe settled back into his Senate seat, continuing on as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs a staffer who started in Sen. Ted Kennedy's office in 1985, Nancy Soderberg got to know Biden.\n\n\"He is just Joe. He has been exactly the same for the 30 years I've known him,\" said Soderberg, a former ambassador who served in various foreign policy roles in the Clinton and Obama White Houses.\n\nToday Soderberg is director of the University of North Florida's Public Service Leadership in Jacksonville.\n\nBiden supported Soderberg's Senate confirmation as alternate representative to the United Nations and in 2018 endorsed her unsuccessful run for the Congressional seat covering Volusia and Flagler counties.\n\n\"He's just always been lovely to me, very supportive,. very thoughtful,\" she said. \"He looks at you as a person.\"\n\n'Voice for the American middle class'\n\nGwen Graham of Tallahassee has had much the same experience with Biden.\n\nA former member of Congress herself, Graham is also the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. The Bidens and Grahams became close when both patriarchs were on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"He actually was the first person to call me when I won my congressional race,\" Gwen Graham said, \"and he has been incredibly kind in helping me navigate my husband's cancer. ... I feel very fortunate to have known him for as long as I have.\"\n\nMany of Biden's opponents have been fond of questioning what he accomplished over his long career as a senator and as Barack Obama's vice president from 2009 until 2017.\n\nSoderberg said she once had asked her boss, Kennedy, that question.\n\n\"He said when you've been here a long time, you realize that history is a river and you can bend the shape of that river,\" Soderberg said. \"You can be part of the arc of history. There's not necessarily a grand moment of peaks and valleys. ... Biden has been part of the trend of making people more understanding, more supportive of the American dream. He's admitted some mistakes, such as on the crime bill (of 1994), but he's always been a voice for the American middle class, the regular working guy. He's always helped build a consensus for that.\"\n\nBiden ran a second time for president in 2008, but Obama's ascension left Biden available to become vice president.\n\nBailey said one of the highlights of Biden's career came in the White House in 2012, when the vice president became the first national figure to offer an early expression of support for gay marriage. The move preceded Obama's own announcement that he, too, had warmed to the idea, which was ultimately legalized nationwide by a 2015 Supreme Court decision.\n\nHopes for a Biden presidency\n\nGraham was among those endorsing Biden on the first day he announced his last run for president in 2019.\n\n\"I endorsed him because I know the quality of person he is and I felt very strongly he would have won in November,\" she said.\n\nGraham and other Florida supporters were disappointed Biden's opponent, President Donald Trump, won the Sunshine State by 2.3 percentage points, particularly after Biden led in many Florida polls.\n\nBut, she argued, Biden's viability forced the president to expend resources in Florida that ultimately took away from Trump's ability to spend in other key states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which Biden took en route to a 306-232 electoral ballot victory.\n\nGraham said her support was borne not just of her belief Biden was the Democrat most likely to defeat Trump, he was the best one to assume control in 2021.\n\n\"I knew that he would have the skills and experience from Day One to start recovering from four yeas of Donald Trump,\" she said.\n\n\"His career in public service has spanned a time, and I know this time well, when we were able as Democrats and Republicans to put aside partisanship,\" Graham said.\n\nShe anticipates Biden will be able to tap into \"deep friendships with senators who are afraid of Donald Trump,\" for cooperation after Trump is out of power.\n\n\"I hope the American people are ready to put this time of divisiveness and ugliness behind us,\" she said. \"There's no person better than the president elect, who has such empathy and caring.\"\n\nSoderberg said the outgoing president has left a foreign relations legacy that's going to take a long time to rebuild.\n\n\"I think (Biden) understands America's place in the world,\" she said. \"The need for arms control, the global challenges that are impossible for the United States to refute: climate, terrorism, cyber threats, trade. I think he gets that the world is not going to go back to the days of Barack Obama.\"\n\nBut, she said, Biden has hit the ground running.\n\nCrotty said way back in 1986, Biden attracted even Republicans to the Daytona Beach Shores fundraiser her father organized.\n\n\"He seemed to impress both sides of the aisle,\" Crotty said. \"Of course, things weren't as polarized as now.\"\n\nDid you know?:In Volusia, many Trump supporters still refuse to believe Biden won\n\nAnd:Volusia Democrats urge supporters to leave Biden signs up", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/29"}]}

Conley, said in a memo released by the White House that Trump decided to get tested on Friday after they conferred about the matter.\n\nTrump announced at a press briefing on Saturday that he had been tested for coronavirus following his recent exposure to two Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus.\n\nTrump, who said his temperature was “totally normal,” told reporters he took the test Friday night but that it would take a few days to get the results because the test was sent to a lab.\n\nTrump took the test around the time a White House doctor issued a statement saying the president does not need to get tested or self-quarantined for coronavirus because he had not exhibited any symptoms.\n\n— Michael Collins, Courtney Subramanian, Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nStores trimming hours so they can clean\n\nRetailers across the nation are trimming store hours to focus on deep cleanings and to restock store shelves.

T.J. Rainsford, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said that as of Saturday morning, there were no positive cases of the new coronavirus at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the largest Army installation in the country.\n\nThe quarantining of the soldiers was directed by the Army, which said that troops leaving areas that are labeled Level 2 or higher by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should stay in quarantine for two weeks.\n\nWhile in quarantine, the paratroopers will be monitored for health and get appropriate medical treatment, according to the division.\n\n– Rachael Riley and Steve DeVane, The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer\n\nAt least 20 states close all schools\n\nTwenty states and a number of large urban school districts – including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest – are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have made plans to close all schools.\n\nIn addition to Los Angeles, major metropolitan districts in Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Miami-Dade County, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., have also shuttered. A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.\n\nAccording to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.\n\nThe magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.\n\nCustoms intercepts fake virus tests\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.\n\nThe officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday. The vials were filled with a white liquid and labeled “Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)” and “Virus1 Test Kit,” the agency said. The agency turned the shipment over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nTrump adds UK, Ireland to travel restrictions\n\nTrump on Saturday said the United Kingdom and Ireland will be added to the Europe travel restrictions that went into effect late Friday. This means residents of those countries will not be allowed to travel to the United States for 30 days beginning Monday.\n\nU.S. residents and legal permanent residents won't be banned but they will face airport screenings upon their return and will be asked to self quarantine for 14 days.\n\nIn response to the broadened ban and the resulting falloff in travel demand, airlines are likely to sharply cut flights between the U.S. and London and Ireland. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines suspended all flights between the U.S. and the 26 European countries covered by the initial ban.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said he is considering domestic travel restrictions \"specifically from certain areas\" after the Pentagon restricted service members' domestic travel. \"If you don't have to travel I wouldn't do it ... we want this thing to end.\" Read more here.\n\n– Dawn Glibertson\n\nCensus deadline could change\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Saturday the deadline to respond to the 2020 Census is still the end of July, but that could change if the coronavirus crisis impacts the national operation.\n\nCivil rights groups and community activists had called for the Census Bureau to consider extending the July 31 deadline as concerns increase about the impact of the outbreak on the decennial count.\n\nRoss said the agency has a $2 billion contingency budget and will adapt its plans to deal with the coronavirus crisis, including deadlines. Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.\n\nCivil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.\n\nCensus officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.\n\n— Deborah Berry\n\nNCAA had, spent rainy-day fund\n\nThe cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.\n\nIt turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.\n\nBy 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.\n\nThen, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.\n\n“The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.\n\n– Steve Berkowitz\n\nMnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThe House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"\n\n\"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.\n\nMnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’\n\nTrump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.\n\n“I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”\n\nTrump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.\n\n“Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.\n\nAsked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nFrance closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings\n\nFrance and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.\n\nItaly also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.\n\nFrance's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas. The government has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.\n\nIn declaring a two-week state of emergency Saturday, Spain prepared to close all schools, universities, restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide.\n\nSpain’s declaration comes as coronavirus cases soared to over 5,700 with 136 deaths. The declaration also would allow the government to limit free movement, confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nResidents of Madrid, which has around half the infections, and northeastern Catalonia awoke to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities.\n\nIn Italy, mayors of many cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close public playgrounds and parks as European countries fashion different polices to try to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nElsewhere, Denmark and Poland became the latest countries to shut their borders to most travelers.\n\nIsrael on Saturday banned gatherings of more than ten people and ordered that restaurants and movie theaters close.

It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.\n\nIt will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.\n\n\"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.\n\nThe administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse.

Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.\n\n“I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.\n\nFormer President George W.

But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/25/guitar-hotel-creepy-dolls-slime-museum-news-around-states/40414979/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nParrish: Alabama Power Company has agreed to pay about $222,000 to settle a chemical spill and fish kill. News outlets reported the amount includes a civil penalty and compensation. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said more than 500 fish were found dead in March, days after about 700 gallons of flame retardant spilled into Baker Creek near the company’s coal-fired plant in Parrish. The state agency said its investigators were ordered by Alabama Power personnel to leave the plant on March 29 because they weren’t carrying official state identification. The investigators said many fish had been removed from the water when they returned a few hours later. AL.com reported Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the company removed some dead fish after the spill.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A rule change will allow electronically assisted bikes anywhere that traditional bicycles are permitted in Denali National Park and Reserve. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that the National Park Service issued the e-bike directive at the end of August. The park service said the policy aimed at expanding recreational opportunities and accessibility allows the motorized vehicles on the entire length of the Denali Park Road. An official said that beyond the 92 miles of the road, e-bikes can travel on a single trail of Denali’s front country and into the backcountry via a limited number of access points. The park service maintains a strict definition of an e-bike as a \"low-speed electric bicycle” with a motor under 750 watts, which is 1 horsepower.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:White Castle is open for business in Arizona. The 98-year-old family run business opened Wednesday near Scottsdale, the first franchise in the state and the largest free-standing one in the world. The excitement among residents was so great that a company official estimated the wait to get the famous mini-burgers and a variety of other menu items was running about 31/ 2 hours just after 8 p.m. The 4,589-square-foot restaurant, which can accommodate more than 200 guests, has televisions, free WiFi, and a kitchen that’s entirely visible from the dining room. It also pays homage to rock musician Alice Cooper, a longtime White Castle fan and a member of its “Cravers Hall of Fame,” with a large photo of Cooper in a corner of the restaurant. The Scottsdale-area resident attended the groundbreaking of the restaurant in April and was the first to dine with his family in his namesake booth at a preopening event Sunday night. The restaurant will serve alcohol every day from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be beers and wines available on tap, plus White Claw hard seltzer in mango and black cherry flavors.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:Underage vaping took center stage at a roundtable discussion held by state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Monday at the Donald W. Reynolds Library. Rutledge, who is holding roundtable discussions with local leaders in all 75 counties, spent several hours in Mountain Home after holding a similar meeting earlier Monday for Marion County officials in Yellville. The attorney general also held an afternoon roundtable in Melbourne with Izard County leaders later that day. The Baxter County roundtable touched on the potential impacts of medical marijuana and the state’s involvement in several pending lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers and distributors, but all avenues of conversation seemed to lead back to underage vaping. Vaping’s low-key nature and whimsical flavors have made the devices a popular target of abuse among children. Forty percent of Mountain Home students in grades 8 through 12 are either vaping or have tried it, Mountain Home Superintendent Dr. Jake Long said. The Attorney General’s Office has sued three online vaping retailers, Rutledge said. Her office has also mailed hundreds of warnings to other online retailers warning that it is illegal to ship tobacco into the state for sale. Parents need as much education about the devices as their children do, Rutledge said. Some devices are manufactured to resemble a more innocuous item in passing, she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nEl Centro: The Imperial County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted unanimously to declare a local state of emergency at the Salton Sea. The measure, which will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, will help officials break through 14 years of bureaucratic wrangling and red tape to get dust suppression and habitat projects underway. if the state recognizes the emergency, Newsom can appeal to the Trump administration, and work could begin immediately, rather than waiting until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other entities complete lengthy environmental permitting reviews. Federal and state disaster relief funds could also be freed up. Newsom did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to the action on the state's largest lake, supervisors said they will likely seek another emergency declaration on the badly polluted New River, which flows into the Salton Sea, in two weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A giraffe has died unexpectedly at the Denver Zoo because of complications following a routine medical procedure. KCNC-TV reported the zoo announced on social media that the giraffe named “Kazi” died Tuesday. Zoo officials said the 2-year-old male arrived in Denver from the Milwaukee Zoo in September to become a companion to a female giraffe in its herd. Officials said a castration procedure was successful, but the giraffe experienced trouble breathing while recovering from anesthesia and then stopped breathing completely. The zoo said staff members tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the animal by intubating it and performing CPR. Officials said the castration performed by the zoo’s medical staff is a common procedure used to decrease the competitive, aggressive nature of male giraffes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: The president of Wesleyan University said the school has decided not to pursue the proposed idea of opening a college in China. President Michael Roth wrote in a campuswide email Thursday that he met with those involved in the potential venture during a trip to Asia and it became clear that their “respective goals could not be sufficiently aligned.” Roth said there also were unresolved questions around issues of academic freedom. A Chinese corporation, the Hengdian Group, had invited the private liberal arts school to consider teaming up to open a campus in China. Meetings that had been planned for next week with Wesleyan faculty and students to discuss the proposal have been canceled.\n\nDelaware\n\nTownsend:A crash Wednesday night on Del. 1 near the U.S. 13 overpass near Townsend shut down the highway during the overnight hours, an official said. The crash happened just before 9:40 p.m. and involved two tractor-trailers, said an official with the Delaware State Police. One driver sustained nonlife threatening injuries in the crash, the official said. Del. 1 was closed at exit 119 and at exit 114, according to DelDOT's website. Traffic was diverted onto U.S. 13 north, which also was closed for a time, leading to backups. Some of the debris from the wreck ended up on U.S. 13 north, affecting traffic on that road, said an official with DelDOT's Traffic Management Center. All north Del. 1 lanes were reopened at about 6:45 a.m. By 8 a.m., DelDOT tweeted that U.S. 13 was cleared.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A judge has denied an injunction request that would have blocked the District of Columbia from moving forward on its $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. News outlets reported Judge John Campbell denied the request Friday, stating the D.C. Council didn’t act illegally in issuing the single-source contract to Intralot. Sports-betting technology developer Dylan Carragher filed an injunction last month claiming the contract violated the procurement laws. D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said through a spokesperson that his office is pleased with the decision. Carragher’s attorney, Donald Temple, said he plans to appeal. Carragher also filed a lawsuit against the District claiming the contract illegally bars him and other vendors from participating in the “potentially lucrative enterprise.” The lawsuit is pending.\n\nFlorida\n\nHollywood: It looks like a rock ‘n’ roll guitar. But this one is 450 feet tall and is a light-beam hotel that the Seminole Tribe wants to become South Florida’s latest tourist destination. The Guitar Hotel’s grand opening was Thursday on the tribe’s land in Hollywood. It’s the latest step in the Seminole Hard Rock empire, which includes naming rights on the Miami-area stadium where the 2020 Super Bowl will be played. It’s a unique addition to South Florida’s tourist landscape and no hotel is like it in the world. It has more than 600 rooms and at night, beams of light will mimic the strings of the guitar. The $1.5 billion project also has a refurbished venue for concerts and other events, starting with Maroon 5 on Friday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCordele: A Canadian company said it will lay off 45 workers at a south Georgia wood panel mill as it cuts production. Toronto-based Norbord said it will stop making oriented strand board on one of its two lines at its Cordele plant. The company announced Monday that the cutback will take place in mid-November. Norbord said it’s cutting back because demand is poor, especially in the southeast. The line that’s being closed had been running on a reduced schedule. It will be closed indefinitely, while a second line continues to run a full schedule. The cutback represents 6% of Norbord’s North American capacity. Norbord said it will write down the value of the Cordele mill by $10 million before taxes as part of its third-quarter earnings.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: Roads and an airport have reopened as firefighters continue to fight a west Maui brush fire. Maui officials said the fire above Kahana ridge was 45% contained Wednesday. About 1.5-square miles burned, threatening some homes, prompting evacuations, and forcing the closure of the Kapalua Airport. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the small airport reopened Wednesday morning for normal operations. Maui County spokesman Brian Perry said officials are checking to assess damage and looking into unconfirmed reports of burned or singed roofs. County officials said about six people checked into a shelter at the Lahaina Civic Center on Tuesday, but no one stayed overnight. The shelter was closed Wednesday. There are no reports of injuries.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A black bear cub that was illegally taken from the wild by a Boise man is heading to a rehabilitation sanctuary. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said a “well-meaning” Boise hunter took the cub last Saturday. The department confiscated the bear two days later, and State Veterinarian Dr. Mark Drew has treated the animal for an abscess, infection, abrasions and dehydration. Fish and Game regional supervisor Brad Compton said the bear was not habituated to humans, and it will likely continue to try to avoid humans in the wild. The bear will spend the winter at the Snowdon Wildlife Sanctuary near McCall and will likely be released to the wild next spring, when it is 1, Compton said. Fish and Game spokesperson Evin Oneale said the man who took the bear from the wild thought it was sick and wanted to help it but had no veterinarian training and no authorization from the state. The man kept the bear in a dog kennel in his garage until it was confiscated. Oneale said people who see an injured wild animal can take note of where the animal was seen and then report that location to the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s police oversight agency has recommended only a 30-day suspension for an officer who fatally shot a fleeing teenager in 2011, concluding it missed the five-year deadline for firing him under state law. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability also recommended Macario Chavez be put on desk duty indefinitely. A police spokesman said Tuesday that Chavez already has served the suspension. The office found Chavez showed a “reckless disregard for human life” as he fired 31 times at Calvin Cross with a high-powered rifle. Two other officers fired 14 times at the 19-year-old. The officers reported Cross shot at them. However, records show the only gun found at the scene was so clogged with grime it could not fire. Chavez and the others were initially cleared of wrongdoing in 2013.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Authorities said the man and woman who died when their SUV plunged from the fourth floor of a downtown parking garage came from Illinois. The Marion County Coroner’s Office on Thursday identified the couple as 70-year-old Iristeen Hunt and 73-year-old Charles Hunt of University Park, Illinois. The car plowed through the wall of the Market Square Center Garage just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, tumbling four floors before landing on its roof in an alley behind the City Market. The couple died at the scene and a man who witnessed the plunge was treated for shock. Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith has said the woman was driving.\n\nIowa\n\nMason City: Members of a veterans group will dedicate monuments depicting male and female soldiers. The Globe Gazette reported the monuments will be dedicated Saturday at the All Vets Center. They have been added to a display that includes a Howitzer and flagpole. The monuments were obtained and repaired after a fundraising effort that included rummage sales and dances. One statue shows a female soldier who carries her helmet and has an M-4 rifle slung over her shoulder. The other shows an infantryman from the Vietnam War.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A wayward squirrel is being blamed for a power outage in Topeka. KSNT-TV reported that about 3,000 Evergy customers were without electricity when the power went out around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Crews had the lights back on within about a half-hour. The electric company said a squirrel made contact with equipment, causing the outage. Among those impacted were businesses, Topeka West High School and several traffic lights.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: The McCracken County Humane Society is struggling after taking in 65 dogs in two days. The Paducah Sun reported it started on Sunday with the report of a pit bull puppy in bad shape. The puppy later died, and on Monday 10 dogs, most of them pit bulls, were removed from the residence. One of them immediately gave birth to a litter of 11. Then on Tuesday, McCracken deputies learned that jail inmate Jennifer Campbell had dogs in her home that had not been taken care of since her arrest the previous Friday. Campbell would not consent to an animal welfare check, so they had to obtain a search warrant. Animal Control found more than 40 Chihuahuas in the home in extremely poor conditions, including some that had died. Forty-four Chihuahuas made it to the shelter on Tuesday. Because all 65 dogs are part of court cases, the shelter cannot immediately put them up for adoption. Vannerson said the situation is difficult. Before this week, the largest number of animals the shelter had taken in at once was 27 cats a few years ago. Despite the difficulty of suddenly caring for so many animals, Vannerson has been heartened by the public’s support. The phones are constantly ringing with people wanting to know when the dogs can be adopted. Donations of food and money have come in, too. Vannerson said she was moved to tears when one man showed up with a $1,000 donation Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s farmers could start growing industrial hemp by the spring if federal and state agriculture agencies keep their regulatory work on track, Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said. Strain outlined to state lawmakers Monday the regulations his department has drafted for industrial hemp production, rules that will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. Lawmakers earlier this year agreed to legalize hemp production in Louisiana, saying that would help farmers diversify their crops. The law is in line with what’s allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances. Hemp is a member of the cannabis plant family but contains only traces of the THC chemical compound that causes a high for marijuana users. Hemp is used for textiles, fuels, rope and chemical absorbents, among other products. The state law required a hemp growing and production regulatory plan to be submitted to the USDA by Nov. 1. Strain estimated 100 to 200 farmers will plant hemp across as many as 80,000 acres of Louisiana soil in 2020. He warned that the expense from cultivating the plant and the strict regulations could keep some smaller farming operations from producing the plant. Growing hemp for individual use is prohibited.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The University of Maine is getting more federal funding for a floating platform to support up to a 12-megawatt wind turbine. The grant, announced Wednesday, is expected to be worth about $5 million for UMaine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. The center already has developed smaller floating hulls to support 6-megawatt turbines to be placed off the coast of Monhegan Island. That pilot project, dubbed Aqua Ventus, is viewed as a major test for floating wind turbine technology. The new funding announcement was made Wednesday during the American Wind Energy Association Offshore WINDPOWER Conference in Boston. Offshore wind power projects stalled under former Republican Gov. Paul LePage. But Democratic Gov. Janet Mills directed the Maine Public Utilities Commission to approve a contract to get the project back on track.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: After a 10-month investigation, Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, has been charged with theft and fourth-degree burglary in connection with the taking of a baby Jesus statue from an Ocean City church's outdoor nativity, according to police. The theft occurred just after 6 a.m. on Dec. 31, 2018, according to a January Facebook post from the police department. In that post, police also released images of the suspects and their vehicle, which had been captured on surveillance cameras. Charging documents show the break in the case came when a tip was called into the police department after a local news station aired a story about the theft featuring those surveillance images. The police department posted an update on the investigation to Facebook on Wednesday announcing that Coke, the main suspect in the theft, had been identified and charged.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFramingham: The North Hall dormitory at Framingham State University will soon be renamed in honor of abolitionist and journalist Mary Miles Bibb, the school’s first African American woman to graduate. In 1843, Bibb graduated from the Lexington Normal School, which later became Framingham State University. She then became one of the first African American female teachers in the country. The university’s board of trustees agreed to the plan after receiving a petition from students in 2018. Details of the official renaming ceremony have not been confirmed.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:A 100-year-old World War II veteran from Michigan has been honored for guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Jack Eaton is the oldest living sentinel of the monument, which he protected from January 1938 to December 1939. Eaton viewed his plaque for the first time at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Wednesday. The Detroit Free Press reports that Eaton said he has wanted the plaque for a while. His stepdaughter, Brenda Warburton, said Eaton got a little choked up on seeing the plaque, noting that’s unusual for him. The Burton resident realized he didn’t have a plaque after touring the guard barracks of the tomb in 2017, where plaques of every living guard are displayed. A plaque was erected after he inquired about it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: The History Center of Olmsted County has posted photos and videos of its miniature dolls on social media, taking votes for the most nightmarish one. Curator Dan Nowakowski told Minnesota Public Radio that for a lot of the dolls, the freakiness is all in the eyes. Some have movable eyelids that snap open when you lift the dolls up. The paint has chipped off the face of another contender, leaving it looking like a mummy. Nowakowski said the dolls weren’t intended to be frightening when they were made, but damage from play and the passage of time have turned them creepy. The winner and runner-up will be displayed over Halloween.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A retired police chief appointed to act as the temporary city manager of Pascagoula has announced he’s leaving the role after less than a month. The Sun Herald reported Kenny Johnson announced his Oct. 31 retirement less than two weeks after city leaders appointed him to the role. The former Pascagoula police chief said he notified officials about his impending retirement Monday after meeting with the state public employee’s retirement system. Councilwoman-at-large Jennifer Colmer said the city planned to hire a new manager by Oct. 30, so Johnson’s announcement wasn’t surprising. Johnson was appointed after the city’s attorney and manager, Ryan Frederic, abruptly announced he was going on medical leave. Officials have since separated the roles, so Johnson would only serve as the attorney upon his return.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo said that Rani, a 23-year-old Asian elephant, is pregnant and due to give birth next summer. The zoo’s bull elephant, 26-year-old Raja, is the father. Raja is among the most popular animals at the zoo. He was the first Asian elephant born there, in 1992. The calf will be his fifth offspring. The zoo said elephant pregnancy lasts about 22 months. A newborn calf weighs up to 350 pounds. The gender of the calf is unknown.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a Missoula city ordinance requiring background checks on all gun sales in the city, ruling that it goes against a state law prohibiting restrictions on gun sales. The five-justice panel ruled unanimously that the ordinance, the first of its kind in Montana, is barred by a law that says local governments are not allowed to exercise any power that “affects the right to keep or bear arms.” The decision overturns a ruling by a district judge who said the ordinance complies with another section of state law that allows local governments to enact rules to keep felons, the mentally ill, minors and people illegally in the U.S. from possessing weapons. The high court ruled the Missoula ordinance went too far by subjecting every private gun sale to a background check. Federal law requires background checks on gun purchases from licensed sellers, such as gun stores, but not on private sales. The ruling upholds a previous opinion by Attorney General Tim Fox, who said in a statement that he was confident his position would be vindicated.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The name of the top candidate for the University of Nebraska system presidency could be publicly disclosed at the Board of Regents’ meeting Friday. The Board of Regents agenda was amended Tuesday to include what the notice said is the “potential designation of a priority candidate” for the position. Hank Bounds announced in March that he was leaving the post and state and has since become a professor at the University of South Alabama. The system president is its overall administrative leader, and the chancellors oversee the operations of the campuses in Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha. A 23-member committee worked with a search firm to identify candidates and forward the names of some to the regents. If regents were to vote for a priority candidate Friday, he or she would then undergo 30 days of vetting by students, faculty, staff and others before the regents could make a final decision.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: State wildlife officials have ordered a quarantine on a Boulder City horse facility after multiple horses contracted a contagious virus before being euthanized. The state Department of Agriculture said lab results confirmed animals at the Horseman’s Association Property tested positive for horse herpes. Department officials said the quarantine is a precautionary measure to avoid the spread of Equine Herpesvirus-1 among the 500 horses on the southwest Nevada property. Officials said the virus is a highly transferrable disease between horses, or between horses and humans. Horse owners said signs of the disease appear to be fever, cough or runny nose.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLandaff: A group of friends, family and fellow soldiers recently gathered at the Landaff Cemetery to mark the 15th anniversary of the death of Army Spc. Alan Burgess. Serving with the New Hampshire National Guard in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, Burgess was killed when a car bomb detonated near his vehicle on Oct. 15, 2004. He was 24. More than two dozen showed up, many of them soldiers who served alongside Burgess. They spent hours recalling his humor and his humanity, trading stories that often ended with laughter. Serving in the 2nd Battalion, 197th Field Artillery Forward, Burgess’ unit was often used for transport assignments, and as a joke, he bought and mounted a taxi light for the top of his Humvee. The fare for his ‘taxi’ was a bottle of nonalcoholic beer.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic Highlands: A man said he and his hiking companion were rescued after they fell off a cliff because the impact spurred his smartwatch to call 911. James Prudenciano and Paige Paruso were hiking in Hartshorne Woods Park last week when they got lost in the woods. They eventually tumbled down a steep cliff as darkness set in. Prudenciano had bought the watch two days earlier and chose to activate the “fall detection” feature, which alerts the owner’s emergency contacts and calls 911 when it detects that its user has fallen. Rescuers were able to reach the couple, who were taken ashore by a boat. They were treated at a hospital for undisclosed injuries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: City officials have announced plans to sell a $150,000 property the city acquired from the federal government. The Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Interior built the industrial site in 1962 or 1963 and used it as a saline water testing plant before its 1984 closure. Roswell Mayor Dennis Kintigh said the city decided to sell because of maintenance issues and intentions to subject the land to property tax. Officials said the site is leased by Wisconsin-based international manufacturer A.O. Smith for about $9,000 a year. The City Council approved a request to search for bidders Oct. 10. Bids are due by Nov. 26. Officials said a completed sale is expected by March if a bidder comes forward and city and state officials approve the contract.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: An immersive, 8,000-square-foot museum dedicated to all things slime opens Friday for a nearly six-month celebration complete with a sticky barefoot lake walk and DIY bar. There’s also the opportunity to don goggles and a poncho and get doused in the stuff that has a big following but a questionable impact when it comes to disposal and the environment. The brainchild of Karen Robinovitz, Sara Schiller and Toni Ko, the so-called Sloomoo Institute is the latest in Instagram-friendly pop-ups to hit New York and then travel to other locales. The idea, the co-founders said during a preopening tour, is simple: To spread slime’s powers of rejuvenation and relaxation. Technically speaking, slime is a cross-linked polymer scientifically known as a “non-Newtonian fluid.” Its history stretches back to the 1830s, when polymer science originated and Nathaniel Hayward and Friedrich Ludersdorf concluded that adding sulfur to raw, natural rubber prevented it from getting sticky.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A state House panel supports a $660 million fix for cash-flow problems at the Department of Transportation attributed to disaster recovery spending and litigation losses. But the chamber’s top budget-writers aren’t expected to support it. WRAL-TV reported the measure approved on Wednesday by a transportation spending subcommittee would give $360 million to DOT to cover legal awards after courts struck down a law that previously kept land costs for highways low. The state government also would loan $300 million to DOT, with full repayment by 2025 through federal disaster reimbursements. Low cash levels forced DOT this year to suspend hundreds of projects. House budget chairman Rep. Chuck McGrady opposes the measure – especially the cash advance – and expects colleagues will, too. McGrady said a separate proposal is being assembled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has announced his plans to seek reelection in 2020. In a video announcement posted on YouTube on Thursday, Burgum highlights accomplishments since he and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford took office three years ago. Burgum said they are “reinventing government with modern business efficiencies” and have “turned a budget shortfall into a budget surplus and cut government spending without raising taxes.” The 63-year-old Republican said North Dakota is headed in the right direction with increased employment and higher wages. Burgum defeated Democrat Marvin Nelson and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November 2016 gubernatorial election.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legislation dubbed Tyler’s Law would place a professional engineer on the Ohio Advisory Council on Amusement Ride Safety. The panel makes recommendations to the state’s agriculture director about safety matters, including monitoring and inspecting rides. The measure is named for Tyler Jarrell, an 18-year-old Marine recruit killed when the “Fireball” ride malfunctioned and broke apart on the opening day of the 2017 Ohio State Fair. Seven others were injured in the accident later blamed on excessive corrosion in a steel support beam. The bill heads to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine after receiving unanimous approval Wednesday in the Senate. It cleared the House in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: One of the nation’s top rating agencies is upgrading the state’s economic outlook from “stable” to “positive” in large part because of the 2018 passage of tax hikes that have resulted in budget surpluses and increased reserves. Moody’s Investors Service announced Wednesday it was also affirming the state’s Aa2 rating, the agency’s third-highest rating. The agency’s positive outlook indicates it expects strong fiscal management and a commitment to increasing reserves. The agency also cited the state’s relatively low state debt and pension burden. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he wants the state to set aside $2 billion in reserves to help better prepare the state for its next economic downturn.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: An invasion of purple sea urchins that destroyed underwater kelp forests off the California coast is now hitting Oregon. Numbers released by Oregon’s wildlife agency show 350 million of the urchins on one reef in southern Oregon alone – a 10,450% increase since 2014. The purple urchins have devoured all the kelp, killing off important fisheries for red abalone and red sea urchins in California and Oregon. A coalition of scientists, ecologists and private business interests is trying to harvest the unwanted urchins and transfer them to sea urchin “ranches.” The urchins are fattened up at the ranches for sale to a global seafood market.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJonestown: The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it rescued 83 cats and 10 dogs from unsafe conditions at a self-proclaimed rescue facility. WHTM-TV reported that the animals were removed from the Jonestown property on Wednesday. Authorities say many of the cats were suffering from respiratory infections and eye conditions and several dogs were very thin. Most of the animals were living in enclosures with feces and urine that had accumulated over several days. Five dead cats were found in one enclosure. One cat’s remains could not be removed because it had decomposed so much. All the rescued animals were given to the SPCA. They are expected to be up for adoption once they receive medical treatment. An investigation is ongoing and charges are pending.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Construction of an artificial reef off the coast of East Providence is expected to take place this week. The Providence Journal reported that the reef will be installed off Sabin Point. The reef is intended to become a habitat for fish that live in Narragansett Bay, including tautog, black sea bass and scup. It will be made of precast concrete balls with holes in them. The $47,000 project is being funded through the federal Sports Fish Restoration Program and a grant from the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council approved the project in June.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: An Atlanta-based timber company is ending production at two rural South Carolina wood product plants that employ 240 workers. The Post and Courier reported Tuesday that Georgia-Pacific said declining conditions in the U.S. home building industry are forcing it to idle its McCormick and Allendale sites by the year’s end. The company said all employees will be let go, except for crews needed to manage inventory and maintain the properties. In a written statement obtained by the newspaper, the company said it will continue production for up to 60 days, after which the sites will be closed but maintained in case market conditions improve enough to resume production. The company said it will hold employment fairs to help workers find new jobs. The displaced workers will be eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHot Springs: Some bison cows at Wind Cave National Park are being monitored with collars that communicate with satellites. The Rapid City Journal reported the collars will be affixed on 10 bison during roundups, which occurs every other year. Greg Schoreder, the park’s chief of Resource Management, said the collars will allow park officials to see how the bison use the park’s resources, specifically water resources. It could help officials determine if more watering areas are needed to prevent overuse and damage of existing water supply. Schroeder said collars will transmit daily from four locations and will be sent to park officials’ emails. The nonprofit organization Black Hills Parks & Forests Association raised money for the collars. The park hopes to show the bison’s movements to guests in the visitor center.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Nashville’s sheriff said there’s proof that Johnny Cash was granted law enforcement authority four decades ago. At the Johnny Cash Museum this week, Sheriff Daron Hall unveiled a blown-up image of the late musician’s September 1979 deputy sheriff commission card, issued by then-Davidson County Sheriff Fate Thomas, featuring Cash’s headshot, fingerprint and signature. Hall said one of his photographers discovered the card in a box. The card authorized Cash to “execute any and all processes that may come into his hands and to maintain the peace and dignity of the State, and arrest any and all persons violating the Criminal laws of the State of Tennessee.” Hall said he doesn’t have evidence of what the deputy work entailed, but Cash believed in prison reform and criminal justice reform\n\nTexas\n\nDoma: Work crews in South Texas are laying steel along the U.S.-Mexico border in preparation for the installation of new segments of border wall. The U.S. Border Patrol said workers were installing steel rebar at a site south of Donna, a small city in the Rio Grande Valley. The rebar will reinforce concrete panels that will, in turn, be topped with 18-foot steel bollards. Crews will also clear vegetation 150 feet in front of the wall. Environmental advocates and opponents of the wall have warned that construction will destroy critical habitat and require the seizure of land from potentially hundreds of people in South Texas. The Border Patrol said a wall will deter drug and human smuggling. The ongoing construction was funded by Congress last year.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based bank, has announced plans to lay off hundreds of employees and close branches across multiple states in the coming months. Zions Bancorporation started notifying employees Tuesday of a 5% workforce reduction. The company employs about 10,000 people in 11 western states. Executives said about 30% of the layoffs would be employees dealing directly with the public, and the remaining would be in enterprise activities and behind the scenes. Company executives said the cuts are necessary after declining revenue. Executives said banks across the country are losing money because of lower interest rates. Executives said the company would close or relocate a small number of branches, but only one in Utah previously announced would shut down. Some executives said they took a pay cut to trim expenses.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: A haunted house in Chittenden County garnered attention for a plotline that some Vermonters considered offensive. Nightmare Vermont changed programming that referenced a school shooting after community members spoke out in protest. The attraction is set to put on performances until Saturday at the Champlain Valley Exposition. The haunted house, in operation since 2004, issued a Facebook apology on Tuesday to the community. The post indicated “any reference to current events or plotlines involving students and weapons” will not factor into the production. The post received a few comments from Facebook users who felt the haunted house’s response was an unnecessary adjustment. The backlash to the storyline came largely from the Slate Valley Unified Union School District, as Superintendent Brooke Olsen-Farrell said many felt the opening plot referenced a firearm in a school setting, according to reporting by the Rutland Herald. The performance mentioned Parkland, Florida and included a reference to Fair Haven Union High School, which had a school shooting scare in 2018. The group’s director, Jana Beagley, clarified that the intention of the plot “was against school violence” and assured that the program “cut all references and plotlines entirely out of respect for the feedback we received,” according to the Herald.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Roanoke County has reversed a ban on sleeping in cars overnight. The Roanoke Times reported the Wednesday reversal comes after months of backlash over the February ordinance. The newspaper said the ordinance was decried by people who said it infringed on personal liberties and created additional hardships for those without stable housing. Officials have said the ordinance was meant to allow the county to intervene in unsafe situations. Hollins District Supervisor Phil North echoed that Wednesday, adding that authorities never planned to punish offenders with the fine specified in the ordinance. No one was charged under the ordinance. North said there’s no point in defending an ordinance the county didn’t intend to apply. County Attorney Peter Lubeck said the public’s opinion influenced the reversal.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A divided state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that birthdates of state employees are public records that are subject to disclosure. In a 5-4 ruling , the court said there was no statutory or constitutional allowance that would preclude the release of such information. The decision reversed a Court of Appeals ruling and reinstated a lower court ruling that denied a motion to permanently enjoin the release of state employee names, birthdates, and email addresses. The case stems from a 2016 request from the Freedom Foundation, a conservative group that had been seeking disclosure of records of union-represented employees, so it could contact them as part of its effort to reduce the size and influence of public-sector unions. Several unions sought to stop the release of the records.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice wants to expand the state’s winemaking industry. The Republican governor on Wednesday said he’s asking officials in the state’s commerce and agricultural agencies to look into growing the wine business in the eastern panhandle. Justice said having more vineyards and wineries in West Virginia will boost tourism and local economies. He noted that Virginia has benefited from promoting its winemaking industry where the state borders West Virginia’s eastern panhandle. Justice said he wants agriculture officials to evaluate winemaking conditions in the eastern panhandle. He wants commerce officials to investigate the market for vineyards.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A group from Wisconsin is in South Burlington, Vermont, to learn more about how the area is dealing with the arrival of the F-35 fighter planes being flown by the Vermont Air National Guard. State Rep. Chris Taylor, a Democrat, told MyChamplainValley.com that people in the Madison area are “really struggling to know what this means.” Last month, the first two of what are to be 20 F-35s arrived at the Burlington International Airport. The arrival of the jets, which are louder than their F-16 predecessors, followed years of concern, and opposition from some, about the noise. The Air Force has named Truax Field in Madison a preferred alternative to receive 20 of the jets. Earlier this month, the Wisconsin Assembly passed a resolution supporting the F-35s.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A pizzeria in Gillette is stocking up ahead of a jump in the cost of Parmesan cheese from Italy. Pizza Carrello usually orders one big wheel of Parmesan at a time but recently bought five. Restaurant co-owner Ariane Jimison told the Gillette News-Record she expects the price of Parmesan to go up because of a 25% tariff on European Union products including wine, olive oil and cheese. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed the tariffs in response to EU subsidies for European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Each Parmesan wheel Jimison orders sells for $900. Jimison said she would have bought more but only five were available. Parmesan cheese comes from northern Italy, where it is aged for two years at room temperature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/opinions/britain-empire-history-kenya-bergen/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The British Empire: A legacy of violence? | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, an author and a professor of practice at Arizona State University.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was laid to rest last week at Windsor Castle, home to monarchs for the past thousand years. What was not laid to rest with the Queen’s internment was an important question: What does the future look like for countries of the Commonwealth, where the British monarch remains the head of state?\n\nPeter Bergen CNN\n\nCharles III is the King today of 14 “realms” outside of the British Isles. In some of those realms, such as Australia, Canada and Jamaica, there are now calls to jettison the monarchy and instead install a republic, just as Barbados did last year.\n\nA related question is also surfacing now: What is the legacy of the British Empire writ large? British schoolchildren have long been taught comforting fairy tales about the beneficence of the largest empire in history, but recent historical scholarship is painting a quite different picture.\n\nLeading that charge is Harvard University historian Caroline Elkins, whose 2005 book, “Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain’s Gulag in Kenya,” found that the British detained some 1.5 million Kenyans in detention camps or in barbed-wire villages during the Mau Mau uprising in that country in the 1950s, thousands of whom died and some of whom were tortured. The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 2006.\n\nSome initially criticized Elkins’ findings as exaggerated, but they were vindicated years later after Kenyan torture victims sued the British government for damages. Senior British officials eventually conceded publicly in 2013 that British forces had indeed tortured Kenyans, and the UK government paid out a nearly 20 million-pound settlement to more than 5,000 elderly Kenyan victims.\n\nIn recent years, Elkins has broadened the scope of her inquiries beyond Kenya, publishing a new book in March called “Legacy of Violence: A History of the British Empire.” I spoke to Elkins last week about her work. Our conversation was edited for clarity.\n\nPeter Bergen: When Queen Elizabeth died, what was running through your mind?\n\nHistorian Caroline Elkins Tony Rinaldo\n\nCaroline Elkins: First, what an extraordinary life. Seventy years as monarch. As a person, as an historian, how can one not marvel at that? Second, the differences in public reactions in Britain and in the former empire. Incredible national mourning and outpouring of grief in Britain, yet in the former empire and now current Commonwealth there were different reactions – that the Queen oversaw what was a violent and exploitative empire.\n\nBergen: King Charles III doesn’t elicit quite the same feelings as his mother did: How will this affect the Commonwealth?\n\nElkins: There are 56 nations in the Commonwealth, most of whom were former British colonies, and of those former British colonies, 14 are what we would call “Commonwealth realms.” That is, they’re not republics, and they still recognize the British monarch as their head of state. So, Charles III is also King of Canada and King of Australia, and it’s in these countries where there is a real push for referendums to change and to become republics.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of, what is the purpose of the broader 56 nations in this Commonwealth? The Queen obsessed over the Commonwealth; it was the coda to empire. She oversaw in her reign the dissolution of much of the empire and the creation, with a kind of monarchical mythmaking, of the Commonwealth as being a force of good, a force of peace, a force of democracy in the contemporary modern world of which she remained the head.\n\nSo, King Charles III is in a tricky situation because, in some ways, the Commonwealth is a confidence trick. How much do these nations today believe that they are part of something that’s greater than themselves? When these nations joined the Commonwealth in the ’50s and ‘60s, one could make that claim. But I suspect there are now a lot of Commonwealth nations looking at this and asking themselves, “What’s the point?” Britain’s economy is in bad shape; going it alone with Brexit was a mistake, and geopolitically it’s on the wane.\n\nBergen: Queen Elizabeth found out that she was the new monarch in Kenya in 1952 when she was on a safari there. Tell us about your research in Kenya and reflect on the fact that the newly minted Queen Elizabeth was in the country around the time that the anti-British Mau Mau rebellion was starting to get serious.\n\nElkins: There’s the famous story that Elizabeth, staying at Treetops Hotel in Aberdare National Park in Kenya, went up a tree as a princess and came down a queen. At the same time, just beyond where Queen Elizabeth was viewing game, the Kikuyu, the largest ethnic group in Kenya, were taking mass oaths to join a movement called Mau Mau, whose stated purpose was, to kick all Whites out of the country, which were the British settlers and the British colonial administration.\n\nAlmost from the get-go in 1952, there were whistleblowers in Kenya. Missionaries were saying that torture by the British was going on. Eventually, the Church Missionary Society published a pamphlet called “Kenya – Time for Action!” describing the kind of horrible things that were happening.\n\nWhen I started researching the history of the Mau Mau uprising, there were difficulties in writing the book because at the time of decolonialization, Britain went through a very systematic process of destroying documentation about the empire. In the case of Kenya, I estimate that about 3 1/2 tons of documents were destroyed, and some other documents were repatriated back to Britain and kept under lock and key. So, what it meant for an historian like me is I had to try to piece this story back together again, and it took about 10 years to do that.\n\nIn my 2005 book, “Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain’s Gulag in Kenya,” I concluded that while the British government said that they had detained 70,000 to 80,000 Kenyans, in fact my research revealed that 1.5 million Kenyans were detained either in detention camps or in barbed-wire villages. These detention camps and villages were not the sites of “hearts and minds” campaigns but instead sites of systematized violence condoned from the very top of the British government and executed in a routinized way, and that every effort was made to cover this up.\n\nThe book came out to “critical acclaim.” There was probably more emphasis on the “critical” and less on the “acclaim” in part because it was one of the first books that really challenged this narrative of British exceptionalism in the empire. At that time, in 2005, I was a young academic historian. It was a rather crushing reception.\n\nAnd then I was asked to be an expert witness for a case involving Kenyans suing the British government for torture endured while they were detained during the Mau Mau uprising. During the discovery process for this case, the British government said for the first time, “We’ve just discovered boxes of previously undisclosed files that we found at Hanslope Park.” Hanslope Park is where all the very highly sensitive British government documents are kept. And alongside those boxes from Kenya, there were also 8,800 files from 36 other British colonies similarly packed up and spirited away at the end of empire.\n\nHaving this documentation was crucial to the case. I pulled together a group of Harvard students, and we worked 24/7 going through these documents, and what became clear is that we had thousands of pages of additional evidence supporting my research and claims about what had happened in Kenya, and at the end of the day, the British government settled the case that had been brought by the Kenyan victims.\n\nBergen: Was Kenya exceptional in the British Empire?\n\nElkins: That took me about 15 years to answer and over 800 pages in my new book, “Legacy of Violence.” Not only is Kenya not exceptional, it’s one moment in a longer period of time that shows how the British created systems and practices to enforce colonial control, such as forced labor, torture and murder throughout the British Empire.\n\nDuring the Boer War from 1899 to 1902 was the first time in history where extensive concentration camps were used to confine one ethnic population, in this case, the white Afrikaners, who the British considered uncivilized, although Africans were also detained.\n\nBritain undertook similar confinement policies for criminals, as well as plague and famine victims, in India beginning around 1857. One of the things I spent a lot of time doing was tracing how these policies evolved – these practices of concentrating populations as well as forcibly moving them.\n\nBergen: This reassessment of British Empire: You are leading the charge. And also, William Dalrymple’s “The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire,” his history of the British East India Company is also part of this reassessment?\n\nElkins: There are many historians working on this. When you think about the kind of work that must take place for each colony, you have a lot of people who are real specialists in particular areas who might specialize in Cyprus or might specialize in India. Some of what I’m doing in this recent book, “Legacy of Violence,” is really drawing off this huge movement towards revisionism.\n\nBergen: Is all history revisionist history?\n\nElkins: Always. History is always being revised by folks like myself. I think in this case, it’s really a massive revision insofar as it really questions what continues to be a strongly held belief about British exceptionalism when it comes to empire.\n\nBergen: So, are the British in high school as they learn about British history being told a bunch of fairy tales?\n\nElkins: I think they’re being told a very particular official narrative that has been carefully cultivated, both by the British government and the monarchy. History is always used for national identity to galvanize a population, to imagine itself as something greater than any individual. And it’s important to remember that beginning in the 19th century, quite intentionally under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, there was an entwinement of nation, monarchy and empire that was the bedrock of British national identity, a kind of British imperial national identity of which the monarchy is a part. And that continues down to the present day.\n\nShould British school history textbooks be revised? There’s a struggle over this in Britain now. It will be a big moment when we start to see revisions within the textbooks of schoolchildren in Britain that reflect the kind of larger conversations that are happening now between historians and the broader public.\n\nBergen: “The Crown” on Netflix was a very well-executed TV drama. How does that contribute to the way Britain and the world in general sees all this history?\n\nElkins: I have to say, full disclosure, I watched all of “The Crown.” It’s very compelling, and I was writing this book, “Legacy of Violence,” while watching it. One of the few times that the Queen Elizabeth weighed in with her authority is around the issue of apartheid in South Africa.\n\nBergen: To say what?\n\nElkins: To basically disagree with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say that apartheid cannot continue, that Britain cannot be on the wrong side of history, and she used the Commonwealth as a vehicle to make that known.\n\nThe second of which that struck me was the death of her cousin Louis Mountbatten. Mountbatten was the last viceroy of India. He oversaw the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 in which somewhere between 200,000 to 2 million people died from brutal sectarian violence, according to estimates.\n\nThe Irish Republican Army, or IRA, which was a paramilitary organization, formed in 1919 to end British rule in Ireland and create a republic, engaged in a long struggle to end Britain’s continued rule in Northern Ireland after 1922. There were many terrorist attacks, including the IRA planting a bomb on Mountbatten’s boat off the coast of Northern Ireland in 1979, killing him and three people on the boat. And that scene is in “The Crown.” Mountbatten was probably the closest confidant and mentor to Prince Charles, now King Charles III.\n\nThere is kind of a coda to this story when the Queen became the first British monarch in 100 years to go to Ireland in 2011 and (later) extended her hand to one of the former leaders in the IRA.\n\nFour years later Prince Charles met with former IRA leader Gerry Adams and did a similar kind of thing. They had a private conversation. This shows you what the British monarchy can accomplish, the kind of moral authority that it does have, and instances of reaching out their hands to make reconciliation.\n\nBergen: Do the British pat themselves on the back because they were relatively early to abolish slavery, and that has colored their own self-conception as empire builders?\n\nElkins: Yes, I think it’s an important point. I think it’s often held up that Britain led the charge on the abolition movement in the trade of enslaved people (in 1807) and decades later in the use of enslaved labor (in 1833).\n\nAt the same time, I think it’s important to bear in mind that this is the same country that amassed the largest empire history has ever known, with a quarter of the world’s land mass and 700 million people at its height.\n\nOn the heels of the abolition of the trade in enslaved people and the use of enslaved labor, the British launched what is known as their “civilizing mission.” This idea was that, in fact, empire is not about national benefit and exploitation, but it’s really our duty, our “white man’s burden” to go and uplift and bring into the modern world the “backward populations.”\n\nThe interesting part to me is how is it that Britons in general can continue to work and rework their understanding of what the empire meant. What was the civilizing mission? How are they able to accommodate all this into this broader narrative of what is ultimately British imperial exceptionalism, that somehow or another – and it’s a narrative that endures to this present day – that Britain got empire right, particularly when compared to all the other European nations.\n\nAnd so, to me that’s also wrapped up into how the Queen is being remembered today. By some, she’s being remembered as the matriarch of empire, an empire that was a force of good in the world, that really extended the notions of rule of law and free trade – all those things that we hold dear in liberal democracies – while others who say, no, that’s actually not what happened.\n\nLook at all this violence in the empire. I think we’re in a particular moment because formerly colonized populations are demanding that there should be a reckoning, not just in terms of acknowledgement that certain things happened, but also how we write about and remember the past.\n\nBergen: The 1619 Project has reframed the history of the United States around the history of slavery in the country. Are there similarities between the 1619 Project and what you and other colleagues are doing in your reassessment of the British Empire?\n\nElkins: Yes, I do think so. If we look at the ways in which the struggle to understand who we are in the present day and what the future holds is also a struggle about the past. What gives us legitimacy? How did we come to be who we are today? In the United States, it’s often thought that the original sin is the period of enslavement, and we must contend with that if we’re going to move forward as a nation.\n\nNow, the suggestion being made by many in the former empire is that the “original sin” on a global scale was empire. They’re asking: How do we contend with this, and how do you, Britain, address this in such a way that we can all move forward, both from a societal standpoint and an economic one? And it’s not just about reparations. It’s about looking at structural inequities on a global scale and how and why the world is the way it is today.\n\nLook at Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world today. In the mid-18th century, Eastern Bengal was one of the wealthiest parts of the world. What happens in between? A very long period of wealth extraction and decimation engendered by British colonial rule.\n\nLook at Jamaica and imagine the fact that this nation was populated because its citizens were literally chained and shackled beneath ships and brought over. At first, this wasn’t even a self-reproducing population because it was more economical to work people to death than it was to allow them to self-reproduce.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd so these nations are born out of a similar kind of cauldron of violence that has dramatic societal and economic consequences, and I think this is coming to a head, just as the 1619 Project is really raising all these issues about the kind of structural inequities that we have in the United States today. We must understand the past and really have a comprehensive accounting of it. And I think that’s what we’re seeing in different kinds of ways with the history of the British Empire.", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/12/hoosier-caviar-glacial-burst-new-alamo-battle-news-around-states/39943229/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: A new ranking credits Auburn University with having the nation’s happiest college students, while the University of Alabama, its chief rival, is No. 2 at partying. The Princeton Review ranks universities in a number of categories each year, and Auburn comes in No. 1 this year in terms of having a happy student body. Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, is ranked second behind Auburn. The rankings list Alabama as the nation’s second-best party school behind Syracuse University in New York. The Princeton Review is a college admission services company. Its rankings are determined by student surveys on their experiences at 385 universities nationwide.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Russia-designed floating nuclear power plant has begun its journey through the Arctic Ocean this month, causing concerns in the Frontier State. Alaska Public Media reports the 472-foot barge launched in St. Petersburg, Russia, and will continue along the coast to the Bering Strait separating that nation from Alaska. Russian officials say the plan is to dock the world’s first floating nuclear power plant at Pevek, Russia, about 1,250 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. Alaska advocates say they are concerned about potential radiation the barge could produce in the northwest region. Officials say the barge named Akademik Lomonosov is capable of powering a city about the size of Fairbanks and will provide heat and power to the mining region, starting in December.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: The Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center is asking for food donations via its Amazon wish list, citing “an unexpected change in policy” tied to an existing supplier. The corporate decision on the handling of damaged, donated food products means Southwest Wildlife urgently needs dry dog and cat food, which can be given to a variety of animals, including bears, coyotes, skunks, foxes and raccoons. The organization says this year has been especially challenging due to the large number of injured and orphaned animals coming to the shelter. Southwest Wildlife’s wish lists include Purina dog and puppy food products and Nutro brand dry cat and kitten products. Donors can purchase food through the company’s Amazon wish list, send food to the center or drop it off.\n\nArkansas\n\nMansfield: Officials say a series of escapes from the Mansfield Juvenile Treatment Center is merely a symptom of larger problems with the facility, the Southwest Times Record reports. Arkansas Department of Human Services officials say the facility, which holds mid-level juvenile offenders and from January 2017 through June was run by the state, has security protocols, a lack of staff training and a climbable fence that have created an environment that since December has allowed 12 youths on four occasions to escape. Department of Youth Services officials also lied to Sebastian County Sheriff Hobe Runion about the placement of a youth who had previously escaped from the Treatment Center. Treatment Center personnel since the beginning of 2019 have called the Sheriff’s Office at least 17 times for assistance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: Orange County, long known as a national GOP stronghold, now has more registered Democrats than Republicans. The county’s Registrar of Voters says there are 89 more Democrats than Republicans among its 1.6 million registered voters. The county between Los Angeles and San Diego was home to President Richard Nixon and long known as a conservative bastion. The parties each have about 547,000 registered voters, while 441,000 registered voters have no party affiliation. The ascendancy of the county’s Democrats mirrors a long-running trend in California. Today, Democrats hold every statewide office; dominate both chambers of the Legislature; and command a nearly 4 million edge over the GOP in voter registrations. Republicans have drifted into third-party status in the state, behind Democrats and independents.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people have hiked up to a popular scenic lake using a new reservation system. The Denver Post reports that White River National Forest officials received five out of five stars on a shuttle service implemented in May from more than 95% of survey respondents visiting Glenwood Canyon’s Hanging Lake. Park officials say the system replaces a visitor parking lot with $12 shuttle rides from Glenwood Springs to the lake about 155 miles west of Denver. Officials say the goal was to improve the health of the trail and lake by moderating human impact while also improving the visitor experience. Officials say Hanging Lake has a daily limit of 615 visitors and has reached more than 40,000 hikers since the program began earlier this year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: Construction of the planned National Coast Guard Museum is expected to begin early next year. Members of the museum’s board tell The Day of New London that a request for proposals for the first phase of construction is expected to go out Sept. 1. The final design, which was approved earlier this year by the board, calls for an 80,000-square-foot, five-story, interactive, environmentally friendly museum on the city’s waterfront. Plans call for the Coast Guard’s tall ship, the Barque Eagle, to be docked near the museum at a renovated City Pier when the ship is in New London. The museum association has raised about $48 million in public and private funds toward the estimated $100 million cost of the project.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Private donors have pledged to replace a memorial plaque dedicated to a lynching victim that was recently stolen. Delaware State University official Steven Newton said the school would donate funds to help replace the marker. Last week a person noticed the marker to commemorate the lynching of George White was missing. White, a black man, was accused of raping and killing a white woman. A mob lynched him in 1903. Public Archives director Stephen Marz said private donors have also begun contributing to the replacement costs. The marker was erected in June. The memorial organizers say they began raising funds for the new, $2,200 marker shortly after the original disappeared. Delaware authorities offered a $2,000 reward as they investigated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first black woman to serve as American University’s student government president has won a lawsuit against a neo-Nazi website operator who orchestrated an online harassment campaign against her. A federal judge granted default judgment Friday to Taylor Dumpson and awarded her more than $725,000 after The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower failed to respond to her lawsuit. The judge also entered a restraining order against Anglin, his Moonbase Holdings limited liability company, and Brian Andrew Ade. After Dumpson became student government president in 2017, someone hung nooses with bananas containing derogatory messages on the university’s campus. Anglin posted an article about the incident and directed followers to “troll storm” Dumpson on social media.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: A wolf-dog hybrid that escaped from a sanctuary after jumping a 10-foot fence has been captured. News outlets report that something startled Eva on Wednesday morning at the Shy Wolf Sanctuary, prompting her to jump the fence. Sanctuary spokeswoman Cindee Woolley says Eva was spotted in the afternoon and shot with a tranquilizer but ran off before the sedation took effect. A news release from the sanctuary says calls of sightings to the Collier County Sheriff’s Office helped searchers locate the wolf-dog Wednesday evening. Woolley says Eva has been placed in a roofed enclosure to prevent any future escapes. Eva weighs about 60 to 70 pounds and is owned by Miami residents who had boarded her at the sanctuary days before her escape.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A court order has stopped demolition after it had already begun on a downtown building where the first country hit song is believed to have been recorded. Part of the building was knocked down Thursday before crews learned a Fulton County judge issued a temporary restraining order. News outlets report the ruling by Judge Shawn Ellen LaGrua will halt further demolition until a hearing Aug. 29. A developer plans to build a 21-story, Margaritaville-themed hotel and restaurant near where the building currently stands. Atlanta resident and architect Kyle Kessler sued the city, claiming it didn’t allow for due process in deciding to demolish the building. The city says it followed proper zoning procedures. Fiddlin’ John Carson likely recorded “Little Log Cabin in the Lane” in the building in 1923.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Experts say two native bird populations have declined by more than half and could face extinction. Hawaii News Now reports Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project discovered 312 Maui parrotbills and 2,411 crested honeycreepers remain in the wild. Experts say a new monitoring report conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and other wildlife agencies reveals that is 50% less than previous population estimates. Wildlife officials say studies over several decades found multiple threats to these two bird species, including disease and habitat degradation. Experts say there are plans to reintroduce the parrotbills to the Nakula Natural Area Reserve in southwest Maui in order to boost the endangered species’ numbers. Officials say more than 200,000 native plants were planted in forest reserves since 2013 in preparation for the reintroduction.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Central Idaho ranch owners want construction of a trail connecting the popular tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley stopped and additional work to make it a smooth path for hikers and bikers prohibited. Sawtooth Mountain Ranch owners David Boren and Lynn Arnone have been fighting construction of the trail with a federal lawsuit against the U.S. government and on Thursday filed new documents contending the proposed trail violates terms of an easement. The U.S. Forest Service has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that allows a trail 30 feet wide to cross about 1.5 miles of private property. The lawsuit recognizes that an easement exists but contends it doesn’t allow the Forest Service to bring in machinery to create or maintain an improved trail for recreationists.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed legislation he says will remove a barrier for teacher candidates and help address a statewide shortage of teachers. The new law eliminates a requirement that teacher candidates pass a test of basic skills to get an educator license. Supporters say the test was unnecessary because admission to a teacher preparation program already demonstrates that candidates have basic academic skills. It also required candidates to demonstrate skills that weren’t related to the grade or subject they intended to teach. The test cost more than $60. The Illinois State Board of Education says more than 1,400 classroom positions were unfilled at the start of the last school year. The new law means about 1,300 teaching candidates will be able to start student teaching this fall.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In the past two decades, the state’s little-known caviar industry has pumped millions of dollars – one $25 ounce at a time – into the economies of some of southern Indiana’s poorest counties. But the windfall could soon come to an end. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is considering a proposal to stop sanctioning commercial fishing for roe-bearing species, a move that officials say will end decades of overfishing but that some decry as a case of government excess. If approved, the plan would mark the end for a Hoosier industry that is probably better known for the publicity surrounding a series of poaching stings than for the valuable eggs fishermen harvest from American paddlefish and shovelnose sturgeon.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Court records show a newspaper carrier helped save a woman caught in a sex trafficking ring. One of the Des Moines Register’s delivery workers, Lavon Franz, was on her paper route early the morning of July 28 in Ankeny when she saw a woman waving her arms on the side of the road. When Franz pulled over, the woman – who had no cellphone or ID – was crying and said she wanted to go back home to a small town about an hour northwest of Ankeny. Franz took the woman to a convenience store, where an employee called police. Police arrested a 25-year-old woman from East Dubuque, Illinois, on suspicion of pimping and human trafficking. Police say Walters scheduled times for men to pay the rescued woman and others for sex at hotels in Ankeny.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to begin moving inmates to a private prison in Arizona by the end of the summer to help relieve crowding in state prisons. The state Department of Corrections announced Friday that it has signed a contract with Nashville, Tennessee-based CoreCivic that calls for moving up to 360 inmates to CoreCivic’s Saguaro Correctional Facility by the end of the year. Kansas has about 10,000 prison inmates, about 100 more than the listed capacity for its facilities. The department is housing more than 100 inmates in county jails. The state budget includes $16.4 million to put 600 male inmates in county jails or out-of-state prisons. But legislative leaders have had misgivings about using private prisons and in June blocked $6.6 million of the funding in June over that possibility.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The city has been named one of the nation’s top destinations for bachelor parties. In Men’s Journal’s recent list of the 25 best bachelor party destinations in America, Bowling Green is No. 2. First, the group can take a trip to the National Corvette Museum to check out more than 80 variations of the classic American sports car. While a museum might not be what every groom has in mind for his last party as a single man, this museum also has a giant sinkhole containing even more cars. Once the crew have had their car fix, a little spelunking is in order. Men’s Journal recommends heading to Mammoth Cave National Park to explore the world’s longest cave system, about a 35-minute drive from Bowling Green.\n\nLouisiana\n\nRockefeller Wildlife Refuge: The state will build 3 miles of breakwaters to protect a wildlife refuge where the shoreline is rapidly eroding and the bottom is extremely soft. A news release says the new work adds to 4 miles of breakwaters already sheltering the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana. Like the earlier one, the new breakwater will have a core of 10-foot-long geotextile “pillows” filled with very light clay baked at extremely high temperatures. A study in 2011 found that such breakwaters can be built higher than all-rock construction on soft water bottom, making them much better at preventing erosion. The $18 million cost includes $5 million of the state surplus and $4.3 million from Cameron Parish disaster block grants, with the rest in matching funds from BP oil spill penalties.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A survey indicates the cruise ship industry is an important source of return visitors to the state. The survey found that cruise ship passengers don’t make a huge economic impact during their brief visits ashore but that 1 in 3 of them plans to return in the near future. The Portland Press Herald reports the Maine Office of Tourism commissioned the survey to get a reading of passengers’ experiences, perceptions and spending. A Portland-based tourism research group talked to more than 2,500 passengers and crew across nine ports from July to November. CruiseMaine Director Sarah Flink says it was important to have a “baseline understanding of the demographics.” About 400,000 cruise visitors sailed on ships to Maine, spending $29 million. Passengers spent about $70 on average during their visits ashore.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s police commissioner has named a senior FBI agent as the head of the department’s Public Integrity Bureau, which oversees officer misconduct investigations and has faced criticism in the past. Michael Harrison introduced Brian Nadeau on Thursday. He has been the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Baltimore Field Office. Nadeau handled organized crime investigations for the FBI and led the agency’s public corruption unit. At a news conference, Harrison told outlets Nadeau is “quite familiar” with Baltimore and the challenges facing the department. A recent investigation by The Baltimore Sun revealed the department failed to investigate misconduct complaints soon enough, causing about 75 cases to expire without conclusions since 2016.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNick Cocchi is sheriff of Hampden County in western Massachusetts. His name was incorrect in a previous version.\n\nSpringfield: Officials are embracing a controversial tactic amid a dramatic spike in fatal overdoses – sending men to jail for court-ordered addiction treatment. Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi has designated a jail wing for the treatment of men civilly committed for substance abuse reasons. Cocchi and his supporters say the year-old program, which is the only one of its kind in western Massachusetts, is key to curbing the county’s opioid problem. Fatal overdoses have surged more than 80% in Hampden County even as they’ve declined statewide. But Bonnie Tenneriello, of Prisoners’ Legal Services, says forcing people into correctional facilities for treatment only stigmatizes addiction. The civil rights group is suing the state to end the practice. A state commission also recently recommended ending it.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: The University of Michigan will install locks on all classroom and lab doors inside a building where reports of an active shooter triggered campuswide panic last spring. The active shooter alert occurred in March when a sorority held an event featuring balloon popping at the same time as a vigil nearby for victims of the deadly New Zealand mosque shooting. The university said Wednesday that the changes at Mason Hall will help university faculty, staff and students facilitate a faster lockdown in the case of an emergency. MLive reports that the installation is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The project is expected to give the university a better idea of what types of locks are needed inside some of the campus’ more historic buildings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRoseau: Local officials say they’re not optimistic about a return to normal hours at two customs stations used by many residents on both sides of the state’s border with Canada who had built their lives around the old order of easy crossings. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cut the hours of the stations in Roseau and Lancaster in January 2018 as it shifted officers to the Mexican border. The Border Patrol now says many of those officers are being sent home. But Roseau city planner Todd Peterson tells Minnesota Public Radio that Border Patrol officials have told him that officers returning north will be channeled to crossings viewed as more important than Roseau. And he says he doesn’t think local officials can do much to change their minds.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A pizza shop is offering free pies for immigrants and refugees in response to immigration raids at seven poultry plants elsewhere in the state. Dodo Pizza owner Alena Tikhova tells WMC-TV she’s making the offer because she moved from Russia four years ago and wants to offset “hate and cruelty” that she sees against people from abroad. The Oxford pizza store is offering a free medium pizza though Aug. 18 to anyone from another country. Tikhova says the offer is a statement of compassion, saying the 680 arrests by immigration officials “doesn’t feel right to me as a human being.” The owner says Dodo Pizza has given free pizzas to first responders and government workers during past shutdowns, and she plans future donations.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University plans to open a center aimed at becoming a national leader in research and learning on the issue of race. St. Louis Public Radio reports the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity & Equity will open in October. The idea for the center emerged in the aftermath of unrest in nearby Ferguson after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, by a white police officer in 2014. The officer was not charged, but the resulting protests shone a light on how police in Ferguson and other areas targeted blacks and how courts profited from fines and court costs largely borne by blacks. Washington University’s provost and a professor of law, Adrienne Davis, will lead the center as founding director.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Forest Service officials have proposed increasing prices and charging new fees for rental cabins and campgrounds in the Lolo National Forest. The Missoulian reports the federal agency aims to bring the income at sites in the forest in line with the cost of services. The changes include increasing lookouts and cabins that cost $30 to $80 per night up to $45 to $115 per night. Campgrounds would increase to $10 to $20 depending on the site. Forest implementation staff officer Chris James says the new and higher fees are expected to bring in about $250,000 each year. He says about 95% of the fees are directed back into maintaining the forest. The agency is taking public comment on the proposal through Sept. 30.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state Supreme Court on Friday upheld the dismissal of a unique lawsuit brought by a group of tanning salon owners who had claimed the Nebraska Cancer Coalition defamed them and hurt their businesses with an anti-indoor tanning message. The business owners, who operated some 30 tanning salons in Omaha and Lincoln, sued in 2015 after the coalition launched its “The Bed is Dead” campaign, which includes a website and ads that link tanning bed use to skin cancer. The campaign makes such claims as, “Tanning before age 35 raises your risk of melanoma by nearly 60%.” The lawsuit says the campaign not only defamed the salons but also violated the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act. But the high court in its unanimous decision agreed with a Douglas County District Court judge’s dismissal of the lawsuit last year, saying a defamation claim requires more than general criticisms of an industry.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Transportation officials are marking what they call “substantial completion” of three years of work on a $1 billion upgrade of the state’s busiest freeway near downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Gov. Steve Sisolak declared at a Thursday ceremony that the work dubbed “Project Neon” will improve safety and reduce congestion and commuter delays. Workers widened a crucial 4 miles of Interstate 15 between Sahara Avenue and the busy “Spaghetti Bowl” interchange with U.S. 95, and they installed new overpasses and 42 electronic signs to notify motorists of traffic snarls and road hazards. Officials call the highway the busiest in Nevada, carrying 300,000 vehicles a day. They say traffic is expected to double by 2040.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoed a bill that would have re-established and raised the state’s minimum wage, saying it would have had a detrimental effect on workers. The state currently relies on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, the lowest in New England. The Legislature’s bill would have set it at $10 per hour in 2020 and $12 per hour in 2022. Sununu said according to studies, other states and cities that have artificially raised the minimum wage have seen take-home pay decline because minimum-wage workers have their hours cut or their jobs eliminated. The National Federation of Independent Business in New Hampshire supported Sununu, saying many small businesses can’t afford the increased labor costs. Rep. Brian Sullivan, D-Grantham, said it’s impossible for a couple to live on two 40-hour jobs at $7.25 per hour.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWestfield: A house whose current owners were scared off the property by a series of threatening letters has sold for $400,000 less than the owners paid. Derek and Maria Broaddus bought the Westfield home for $1,355,657 in 2014 but didn’t move in after receiving the first of four letters from the anonymous writer. NJ.com reports Andrew and Allison Carr purchased it for $959,360. It was originally listed for $1.25 million in 2016. Andrew Carr declined comment. In a series of letters, the writer asked if the Broadduses were bringing “young blood” into the home and asked the names of their two children. The Broadduses claimed the writer had a “mentally disturbed fixation” on the home. The writer was never found. A judge threw out lawsuits stemming from the purchase.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A smattering of heroin hotspots dotted an online map of the state’s largest city Friday as officials announced the new mapping tool, saying they plan to use it to track drug-use migration across the area. At a news conference, Bernalillo County officials said the GIS map will show the public where used needles and syringes have been collected by county cleanup crews and volunteer groups in Albuquerque and elsewhere across their jurisdiction. It also will show how many needles have been picked up at a single location, providing data that officials say can be used to make sound policy decisions and learn more about the habits of drug users. On Friday, a cleanup crew of mostly county workers gathered at an abandoned property in northeast Albuquerque, where they collected 84 needles – the first batch to be logged in real-time – into the GIS map at bernco.gov/needles.\n\nNew York\n\nMacedon: Singer Alicia Keys and music producer husband Swizz Beats are planning to create a performing arts center in upstate New York. The couple’s proposal to transform an industrial site in rural Macedon was introduced at a town board meeting Thursday. Linda Shaw, an attorney for Keys and her husband, whose real name is Kasseem Dean, says the project will repurpose three vacant buildings to include a classroom, an office building, an art exhibit hall and a performing arts center. The Democrat and Chronicle reports the center is a part of The Dean Collection, the couple’s organization that focuses on supporting artists. Town engineer Scott Allen called the proposal exciting. Shaw says she is scheduled to appear before the city’s planning board Aug. 19.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has a new law focused on ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft that supporters contend will improve safety for both passengers and drivers. Gov. Roy Cooper said Friday that he’s signed a bill that cleared the General Assembly unanimously last month. The bill’s impetus was the death of a University of South Carolina student who police say was killed after getting into a car driven by a man posing as an Uber driver. The law makes impersonating a ride-hailing driver a crime while increasing the penalty for assaulting a genuine ride-hailing driver. Starting in October, ride-hailing cars must have front license tag numbers. By next summer, they’ll have to display their company’s logo to be clearly seen day and night, although alternative signage is possible.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The huge white tube between Washburn and Underwood that once carried coal over U.S. Highway 83 is coming down. The Bismarck Tribune reports the tube that for decades served as a landmark along the road in central North Dakota is being removed Monday. It’s part of a 3-mile conveyor that the Falkirk Mining Co. installed in 1992 to transport coal from its mining operations east of the highway to its handling facilities on the west side. The company last used the conveyor in 2001. In the years since, Falkirk has relied on large trucks, which can each haul more than 200 tons of coal. The vehicles pass underneath the highway to Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station. The power plant burns it to generate electricity.\n\nOhio\n\nWilberforce: A historically black university is advancing its plans to become the first public institution in the state to conduct hemp research. Central State University announced Thursday it’s received $7.1 million in contributions toward current initiatives, including its new hemp research program. The sum includes a single record-setting private donation of $2 million from philanthropist Frank Murphy. President Cynthia Jackson-Hammond says Central State is the only Ohio public university planting seeds for research into hemp, a strain of the cannabis plant used for fiber and cannabidiol, or CBD. Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill last month legalizing cultivation of industrial hemp and the manufacture and sale of CBD products. The next day, the Department of Agriculture planted Ohio’s first legal hemp plants since World War II.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s treasurer says overall receipts to the treasury are continuing to rise, but he warns there are signs of a potential economic slowdown on the horizon. State Treasurer Randy McDaniel released figures Friday that show gross receipts to the treasury topped $1.1 billion in July, up nearly 10% from July last year. Overall collections for the past 12 months totaled nearly $13.7 billion, almost 12% higher than the prior 12 months. But McDaniel also reports tax receipts from the production of oil and gas are declining, and sales tax collections are beginning to drop for the first time in two years. Treasury officials reported sales tax receipts fell below those of the prior year in both June and July.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has decided not to veto a bill that will ease rules for farmers clearing out irrigation ditches, her office told Oregon Public Broadcasting. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported her decision was likely to please many in rural parts of the state, but it spurred a furious reaction from environmental groups. The legislation says farmers would need to give notice that they were going to clear an irrigation ditch but would not need a permit unless they planned to move more than 3,000 cubic yards of material over a five-year period – a 60-fold increase from the current 50-cubic-yard threshold, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Environmental groups argued that the measure undermines the state’s ability to protect state wetlands. Many farm fields in the Willamette Valley are classified as wetlands.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers have started to neutralize a highly toxic chemical on the site of a massive refinery that’s been shut down since explosions and a blaze June 21. Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel says workers are at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions site around the clock, seven days a week in an effort to neutralize the 33,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid there. It could take several weeks to complete. Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most dangerous chemicals in use. Refineries use it to create high-octane fuel. Chemical safety officials have said once it had been released into the atmosphere, a low-lying toxic cloud could travel quickly over miles, affecting more than a million people. Thiel says air monitoring is continuing, and there are no signs that the chemical was ever released.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s oldest black church celebrated its 200th anniversary over the weekend. The Congdon Street Baptist Church opened in 1819 and has had an integral role in providing spiritual and educational needs for the city’s black communities. The Providence Journal reports the original members of the church came from the First Baptist Church in America, where they were forced to worship in a segregated space. In 1863, as tensions grew among the congregation and their white neighbors, the original church was torn down without their approval. Harold Metts, a church deacon and Democratic state senator from Providence, says the congregation has always combated “such evil” with good.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBlythewood: “School Prayer Zone” signs are cropping up near some schools in the state. News outlets report the white and fluorescent green signs show two figures kneeling in prayer, their hands clasped above the words “2 Chronicles 7:14.” The Bible verse promises those who pray and “turn from their wicked ways” will be forgiven. The $714 signs by nonprofit Christ Teens can be seen in several counties and resemble official signs by the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The agency says it didn’t approve the signs, but they’re legal as long as they sit on private property and are outside the highway rights of way. Nonprofit director and founder Vanessa Frazier says she came up with the idea in 2016 and has been working out the details with the state agency ever since.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The military says recent high-altitude balloon flights over the state and others in the Midwest complied with federal laws against conducting surveillance on civilians. Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell says two test flights recently launched from Baltic, South Dakota, were part of a project to develop all-weather radar-imaging capability from the stratosphere. He says no tracking information was collected during these flights, and none will be collected in future flights. But the South Dakota chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said Friday that it still has many questions about the imagery and how it will be used. Policy Director Libby Skarin says the Pentagon statement seems to contradict filings, first reported by The Guardian, saying the balloons were meant to provide persistent surveillance to locate drug trafficking and homeland security threats.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Health officials say this year’s first human case of West Nile virus in the state has been reported. The Shelby County Health Department said Thursday that the mosquito-borne illness has been found in an unidentified person. The person’s condition wasn’t released. Officials said in June that the virus had been found in mosquitoes in the county. Crews have been treating mosquito breeding sites with insecticides and setting traps to capture and kill the insects. The West Nile virus can occasionally cause severe disease or even death. But most human infections are mild and cause fever, headache and body aches that last a few days. The case reported Thursday is the state’s first this year. Three people died of West Nile virus in 2018 in Shelby County.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A local Native American group is bringing a new battle to the Alamo, filing a legal notice declaring the grounds to be an abandoned or unknown cemetery. The San Antonio Express-News reports that could delay the $450 million project to restore and enhance the sacred Texas shrine. And the American Indians in Texas at the Spanish Colonial Missions plans to go even further: The group has launched a fundraising campaign to file a federal lawsuit alleging discriminatory practices in the way city, state and nonprofit officials are guiding the project. Executive Director Ramon Vasquez says new guidelines on the handling of human remains unearthed during the planned restoration work were developed without consulting his organization, whose members are descendants of indigenous people who lived – and likely were buried – in this area well before the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Voter fraud is rare in the state and typically involves parents submitting ballots for children who are away from home serving missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the lieutenant governor says. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox says voter fraud is usually the result of a misunderstanding of election laws, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “They think, ‘Oh, I’ll just fill it out for him, and I’ll sign it and send it back in,’ ” Cox said during a gubernatorial campaign visit to Fielding. In those cases, Cox said state officials “call them up and tell them that’s illegal, you can’t do that.” Completing another person’s voting form is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. Parents may be concerned the postal system will not deliver a ballot in time from overseas. But electronic voting options are now available to young missionaries, officials say.\n\nVermont\n\nBurke: Law enforcement is suggesting that the town require bicyclists to ride single-file on town roads. The Kingdom Trail Association attracts thousands of mountain bikers and others to a trail network in the Northeast Kingdom. The Caledonian Record reports that a deputy from the Caledonia County Sheriff’s Department suggested the ordinance and says it would be safer for everyone. Deputy Joe Rossi says some of the roads in the area are narrow and twisty. Abby Long, executive director of the Kingdom Trail Association, said she would support such an ordinance. Selectboard Chair Christine Emmons said the present law in Vermont is for two bicyclists abreast, so a change would require the adoption of an ordinance.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A federal judge ruled Friday that a school board’s transgender bathroom ban discriminated against a former student, Gavin Grimm, the latest in a string of decisions nationwide that favor transgender students who faced similar policies. The order issued by U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen is a major victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and for Grimm. His four-year lawsuit was once a federal test case and had come to embody the debate about transgender student rights. The Gloucester County School Board’s policy required Grimm, a transgender male student, to use girls’ restrooms or private bathrooms. The judge wrote that Grimm’s rights were violated under the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause as well as under Title IX, the federal policy that protects against gender-based discrimination.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Water has gushed from a glacier on Mount Rainier, damaging a road and trail as it flowed down. The News Tribune reports the water burst on the South Tahoma Glacier started last Monday without warning. Mount Rainier National Park officials say the flow formed new waterfalls and moved boulders down the mountain, leading to the closure of Westside Road and the Tahoma Creek Trail. No injuries were reported. Geologists say similar glacier bursts could occur in the coming weeks or months. The park is warning visitors to head to higher ground if they hear unusual sounds or see changes in creek water levels and ground shaking.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says he’s asked his administration to see what it can do to prevent the closure of Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling. The Republican governor issued a statement Thursday saying that saving the hospital’s jobs must be a top priority. The Ohio Valley Medical Center and the East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, Ohio, released a statement Wednesday saying they would close within two to three months. The planned closures also come after an unsuccessful search for a buyer. The hospitals have lost more than $37 million in the past two years due to declining volume and reimbursements, the statement says. It also says they haven’t been able to compete with the business practices of nearby Wheeling Hospital, pointing to a federal lawsuit that accuses Wheeling Hospital of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWisconsin\n\nManitowoc: A judge has rejected a man’s bid for a new trial in a killing featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer.” Judge Angela Sutkiewicz on Thursday denied Steven Avery’s request in the 2005 killing of photographer Teresa Halbach. Halbach’s remains were found in the Avery family’s salvage yard. Avery argued the state turned over bones to the Halbach family without notifying the defense, but WLUK-TV reports the judge ruled that does not mean Avery should get a new trial. The bones were given to Halbach’s family in 2011, but Avery’s attorneys were not notified until 2018. Tests were inconclusive about whether the bones were animal or human. Avery’s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, tweeted an appeal is likely. Avery’s nephew, Brendan Dassey, also is serving a life sentence in the killing.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The city attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the most sparklers lighted simultaneously over the weekend. Organizers were hoping for about 2,000 people to participate in Saturday night’s effort. The current mark of 1,713 was set in August 2018 in the Japanese city of Takarazuka. Jessica Seders, executive director of Gillette Main Street, told the Gillette News Record she believes the effort was record-breaking. When the count is complete, photos and video will be submitted to Guinness for a determination. Fran Silverness says, if nothing else, it brought the community together.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/16/fugitive-pig-proverb-library-sodium-warnings-news-around-states/40155777/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGuntersville: People in a rural area are raising concerns about the use of “chicken sludge” as fertilizer on farm fields as the state considers new rules on how such products can be used. Julie Lay says the sludge from a poultry processing plant created an overpowering stench when it was applied to a neighbor’s farm fields. Lay says flies also invaded her property in Marshall County. Al.com reports she says the material had a “crust” and chicken feathers. Lay was among several residents who spoke out recently at an Alabama Department of Environmental Management public hearing. The agency is considering new rules on how biosolids – solid material left over from wastewater treatment operations and chicken processing plants – can be used as a fertilizer.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: Two young harbor seals are back where they belong after being rehabilitated through the Alaska SeaLife Center’s Wildlife Response Program and released into Kachemak Bay. Dozens of people gathered at Bishop’s Beach on Sept. 5 to watch as the two seals – Ugashik “Uggy” and Charley Fritz – were released into the waters of Kachemak Bay in Homer by SeaLife Center staff and volunteers, the Homer News reports. Uggy was found neglected by her mother May 29 on a beach near McNeil Canyon, and Fritz was found neglected by his mother on a beach near Homer on May 12, according to an information sheet provided by the SeaLife Center. At that time, both were estimated to be only a week to two weeks old, says Jane Belovarac, curator for the Wildlife Response Program.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Residents with overdue library books might want to wait a bit before bringing back their borrowed copies of the current bestsellers. Starting in November, Phoenix’s public library system will join a growing number of libraries around the United States that have dropped overdue book fees, becoming the nation’s largest metropolis to dump the fines. Phoenix City Librarian Rita Hamilton said the unanimous City Council decision would allow the system comprised of 17 libraries to ensure “that access to our resources is as equitable as possible.” The Phoenix system has been charging 20 cents per item per day, which can add up quickly into dollars owed, an extra expense some families cannot afford. Phoenix’s move is part of a worldwide trend by libraries to eliminate fines the American Library Association considers “a form of social inequality.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general is seeking to move lawsuits challenging a measure giving the prison director authority to determine an inmate’s competency to be executed to federal court. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Thursday filed notice to move the lawsuits by death row inmates Bruce Ward and Jack Greene from Jefferson County Circuit Court. The state Supreme Court in November struck down an earlier version of the mental competency law. Legislators this year approved a reworked version of the law, and the inmates are seeking to have it overturned. Rutledge’s filing says federal courts have jurisdiction because the inmates argue the new law violates the U.S. Constitution. Arkansas has no executions scheduled and lacks the drugs needed for its lethal injection process.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFresno: California authorities have captured an emu after the flightless fugitive led officers down a highway. The Fresno Bee reported Friday that the bird was apprehended following a brief pursuit by California Highway Patrol officers. Authorities say officers responded to a report that an ostrich was wandering along the right-hand shoulder of U.S. Highway 99 northwest of Fresno. Authorities say Madera County Animal Services took the bird into custody uninjured. Officers say they do not know whether the emu escaped a nearby farm or a moving vehicle. Animal experts say the flightless native Australian birds can sprint at up to 30 mph and trot quickly for longer distances. Emus are the second-largest birds in the world behind ostriches.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 40 boats gathered at Inlet Bay Marina on Friday and linked together to form a circle, planning on remaining in formation until Sunday. The event, known as the “Ships Wheel,” is a yearly tradition for the boaters of Horsetooth Reservoir to celebrate the end of summer together. The event was created by Inlet Bay Marina owners Glen and Nancy Werth. “It’s an end-of-year celebration. It’s definitely the highlight of the year,” says Anthony Robbins, a Ships Wheel participant. Robbins says those participating strive to create a safe, positive and family-friendly atmosphere in the reservoir, which he says hasn’t always had the best reputation. During the event, those in the wheel hang out on their boats all weekend, eating and sleeping.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A group of prison inmates has asked a federal judge for bottled drinking water, alleging the tap water at the Osborn Correctional Institution is tainted with bacteria found in sewage. The inmates are seeking a temporary injunction as part of a larger lawsuit that accuses the state of exposing them to hazardous materials such as PCBs and asbestos. They allege numerous inmates have become ill with bacteria known as helicobacter pylori, which is typically water-borne and caused by sewage entering the water supply. Affidavits filed by 38 inmates and former inmates at Osborn described discolored water that smells of feces and contains floating particles. They also say prison staff routinely bring in bottled water to drink and provide to therapy dogs. The state denies the allegations.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Three fatal shootings in less than 12 hours in the state’s largest city mean it has already surpassed its number of dead or injured shooting victims for all of 2018. Wilmington Police report two men ages 24 and 26 were shot Friday morning in a residential area and later died. Police say earlier Friday a 36-year-old woman also was shot and died. Their names haven’t been released, and the deaths are under investigation. The woman was the 78th shooting victim of the year, matching the number recorded in all of last year. The total was exceeded with the shootings later Friday. This year 16 people have been killed in Wilmington shootings, compared to 19 in all of 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who helped spark a youth-driven push for climate change, has come to Washington. On Friday, Thunberg and about 1,500 protesters, many of them schoolchildren, marched and chanted near the White House. Thunberg, who is 16, gained international attention by inspiring protests and school strikes demanding immediate actions to avert environmental catastrophe. Her activism has drawn a passionate following of children essentially challenging their elders to take action. Last month, Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat, landing in New York City on Aug. 28. She is in Washington for several days of rallies and lobbying efforts in advance of a global climate strike declared for Sept. 20.\n\nFlorida\n\nWellington: It took 22 years, but a missing man’s remains were finally found thanks to someone who zoomed in on his former neighborhood with Google satellite images and noticed a car submerged in a lake. Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera says the skeletal remains were of William Moldt, who went missing in 1997. Barbera says a previous resident of Wellington was checking his former neighborhood on Google Earth when he saw what looked like a car in the lake. The former resident contacted a current homeowner, who used a drone to confirm it was a white car. Deputies then found the remains. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System says Moldt went to a nightclub in November 1997 but didn’t appear intoxicated when he left alone.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson says he’s demanding answers from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs after a woman says her father was bitten more than 100 times by ants at a veterans’ home in Decatur. Isakson says he was horrified and “downright maddened” after Laquna Ross told WSB-TV she found her father, Joel Marrable, with swollen, red bumps all over his body when she visited him at the nursing home near Atlanta last week before his death. Marrable, an Air Force veteran, had cancer. The Atlanta Veterans Affairs Health Care System said in a statement that it was told the ants were affecting patients. It said all of the bedrooms at the Eagle’s Nest Community Living Center have been cleaned, and a pest control company is monitoring conditions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says he and other state employees received death threats amid the heated debate over building a giant telescope on the state’s highest peak. Ige disclosed the threats as he and his Cabinet members held a news conference Friday asking people on all sides of the issue to be careful with their language. Attorney General Clare Connors played a voicemail recording in which an unidentified man told a state employee, “I hope you die.” She showed reporters a social media post offering a $5,000 reward for the identity of a law enforcement officer involved in last week’s demolition and removal of a small wooden house built by demonstrators near the camp where they are blocking the telescope’s construction. “I hope that we can all agree that putting a bounty on the head of law enforcement officer is disturbing and deeply concerning,” Connors said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A panel of lawmakers formed to monitor how federal laws affect the state’s sovereignty and report back to the Legislature has created three subcommittees to examine federal lands, education, and health and welfare. Republican Rep. Jason Monks, co-chair of the Committee on Federalism, says the federal lands subcommittee is not a repeat of an interim committee from several years ago that ran up big attorney fees while trying to find a way for the state to take control of federal lands. He says the purpose of the Committee on Federalism created by the Legislature earlier this year is to find ways for the state to work more effectively with the federal government, and the breadth of that challenge is better met by forming subcommittees.\n\nIllinois\n\nOregon: The first steps in repairing a century-old landmark known as the Black Hawk statue are finally underway. Workers began erecting scaffolding last Monday around the 48-foot-tall statue in Lowden State Park in northern Illinois’ Ogle County. Sauk Valley Media reports Quality Restorations Inc. of Wood Dale was scheduled to begin the repair work last spring, but cold, wet weather thwarted that work. The 108-year-old monument has spent most of the past five years beneath a plastic covering to protect it from harsh weather. State budget troubles delayed a promised $350,000 matching state grant for the repairs, but that funding was finally secured over a year ago. The Black Restoration team obtained the remaining $225,000 needed for the project. The cost of repairs will approach $1 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is getting a $2.1 million federal grant to explore ways of reducing its high rate of pregnancy-related deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide the State Department of Health with more than $420,000 a year for five years to improve Indiana’s ability to collect data about pregnancy-related deaths and devise ways to combat them. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the state has the nation’s third-highest rate of deaths of women while pregnant or within one year of their pregnancy’s end. The national maternal-mortality rate is 20.7 deaths per 100,000 births, but Indiana’s rate is 41.4 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the United Health Foundation. Only two other states scored worse: Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nIowa\n\nRed Oak: The Coyote Johnson Muscle Car Auction at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on Saturday marked the event of the summer in southwestern Iowa, the big reveal of a storied collection of cars the public had long awaited. The massive event saw an entire community come out to witness a newly minted legend and see up close the treasure trove of classic American machines that Bill “Coyote” Johnson had kept hidden away for decades. The existence of Johnson’s hoard, more than a hundred in total, was revealed in April. Its existence was a revelation, a previously unknown monument to mid-century auto engineering. VanDerBrink Auctions sold off nearly 100 vehicles in about three hours.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The Kansas State Fair will reevaluate its gun policy this fall because concert security concerns could conflict with state law that allows gun owners to carry their weapons openly. The Wichita Eagle reports that the fair had to screen concertgoers at the Sept. 7 Billy Currington performance because he required it in his contract, and the show was delayed while everyone and their bags were checked. Fair Manager Robin Jennison says the fair will likely have to employ that kind of security more often if it wants to continue booking top acts because such requirements are becoming common.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s chief justice says the drug court program has failed to keep up with surging demand for its treatment services while the state struggles with addiction woes. Chief Justice John D. Minton Jr. told lawmakers Friday that he’ll seek funding to expand drug courts. He told a legislative panel that drug courts and similar specialty courts are serving fewer than 2,500 people at a time when Kentucky faces its worst drug epidemic in history. Minton says that’s not even “scratching the surface of the need.” Drug courts provide court-supervised treatment so people can stay out of jail. Participants take part in counseling and education programs and must undergo drug tests.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two Swiss women have recreated Homer Simpson’s gourmandizing tour of the Big Easy, snarf for snarf, finger-wiggle for finger-wiggle. Biz New Orleans reports it took Janine Wiget, of Zurich, and Katrin von Niederhausern, who now lives in Stockholm, a week to duplicate the segment, which covers 54 restaurants in 1 minute, 27 seconds. The side-by-side video created by the 30-year-old illustrators and graphic designers has attracted more than 1 million views since it was uploaded Aug. 23. The women duplicate every action and camera angle in the sequence from “Lisa Gets the Blues,” which first aired April 22, 2018. Tourism officials are delighted. New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. president and CEO Mark Romig says it’s priceless publicity.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A man who caused a standoff that ended with him being shot three times and his home destroyed by a police explosive has sued law enforcement officials. Dixmont resident Michael Grendell argued police didn’t wait for a negotiator trained to handle mental health crises and failed to obtain a proper warrant to use a bomb. The Bangor Daily News reports 62-year-old Grendell sued Wednesday in federal court in Bangor. Eighteen state police members and one member of the attorney general’s office are defendants. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit. Grendell filed a notice in December saying he would seek $120 million in damages. Last year, he was sentenced to probation and a suspended jail term on charges including criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state panel on school construction has approved more than $13 million for portable air conditioning systems in Baltimore County schools. The money approved by the Interagency Committee on School Construction on Thursday will bring portable air conditioning systems to four of the county’s seven schools that still don’t have air conditioning: Dulaney High School, Lansdowne High School, Bedford Elementary School and Catonsville Center for Alternative Studies. Comptroller Peter Franchot, who has pushed for years as a member of the Board of Public Works to bring air conditioning to schools that don’t have it, says there’s finally some good news, on a day when some schools were closed in the Baltimore area due to excessive heat.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: The state has received more than half a million dollars in federal grant money to help workers at the now-shuttered Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station find new jobs. U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. William Keating, all Democrats, said the grant will help the state provide services like career planning, comprehensive assessments, resume writing and job placement to workers who were laid off earlier this year. The Plymouth plant, which produced electricity for 46 years, employed about 580 people in May. That number is expected to be about 270 by March 2020, according to plant operators. Last month the plant was sold to a private company for decommissioning. It was the state’s last nuclear power plant.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Tidal streaming service has selected five Motor City-based artists as the first winners of a million-dollar grant program to boost music careers. The platform announced Friday that Tidal Unplugged’s inaugural group consists of Emma Guzman, Laurie Love, Olivia Millerschin, Raye Williams and Sam Austins. They were chosen among thousands of applicants. The winners will get, among other things, a monthly stipend, professional training, access to recording and creative resources, and promotional support. They also will produce three songs each that will premiere on the streaming service and perform at a showcase later this year. Tidal officials say they aim to expand the program to other areas of the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Authorities say a fire that destroyed a historic synagogue doesn’t appear to have been a hate crime. Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said Sunday that 36-year-old Matthew James Amiot, of Duluth, was arrested Friday in the fire last week at the Adas Israel Congregation, in the city’s downtown. Tusken says he has no reason to believe the fire was a hate crime, although the investigation is ongoing. Police are recommending that prosecutors charge Amiot with first-degree arson. Duluth fire Chief Shawn Krizaj says the blaze started outside the synagogue and spread into the building. No accelerants were found. According to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with 75 members. Eight of 14 Torah scrolls, the holy books of Judaism, that were in the synagogue were saved.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The wood-frame home where a washerwoman lived as she scrimped to create a scholarship fund has been moved to a museum district honoring African American accomplishments. The Hattiesburg home of the late Oseola McCarty was placed in a tax sale in 2017. The Hattiesburg American reports the local convention commission bought it. Late last month, the home was moved a few blocks from its original site. It will be restored and turned into a museum. McCarty attended school until the sixth grade and washed clothes for a living, saving money to help students needing financial assistance. She was 91 when she died in 1999. She left about $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship was created.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: A worker has found what’s believed to be a Civil War cannonball lodged in a Kansas City area tree that he was hired to take down. KMBC-TV reports the small cannonball fell out as the worker was chopping the diseased tree on the grounds of the Overfelt-Johnston house. The house was used as a hospital during the First Battle of Independence, which was fought across the street in 1862. Fourteen people were killed and 18 wounded as nearly 800 mounted Confederates overpowered the 350 men of the town’s federal garrison. Property owner Randall Pratt says a cannonball also was found when the property was restored in 1980. That cannonball, which had been shot into a wall, is in a county museum. Pratt plans to keep the latest find at the home.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state’s greater sage grouse population has fallen more than 40% over the past three years, mirroring recent declines across the U.S. West for the bird species for which federal officials rejected protections in 2015. State wildlife officials estimate there were about 44,000 ground-dwelling sage grouse in Montana this spring. Sage grouse once numbered in the millions but have seen their range that stretches across portions of 11 states diminished by oil and gas drilling, wildfires, grazing and other pressures. Weather can affect populations from year to year, and wildlife officials say those short-term cycles are most directly responsible for the recent declines. Montana’s drop from almost 78,000 grouse in 2016 was traced to an extreme drought in eastern parts of the state in 2017, says Catherine Wightman with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government collected more tax revenue than expected in August. The Department of Revenue announced Friday that the state received a net total of $462 million last month, which is nearly 5% higher than its official forecast of $441 million. The department says net sales-and-use and miscellaneous taxes came in higher than expected, as did net corporate and individual income taxes. Net tax collections are also higher than expected in the current fiscal year that began July 1. The forecast was set in April by the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board. The board’s projections help lawmakers and the governor determine how much money they have available for the state budget.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An innkeeper selling tickets for campers this week in a tiny desert town is being threatened with legal action by the originator of the “Storm Area 51” internet hoax over the “Alienstock” name. A Las Vegas attorney representing 20-year-old Matty Roberts sent a cease-and-desist letter Thursday telling Little A’Le’Inn owner Connie West to pull the plug on events West says she’s still planning for Thursday through Sunday. West didn’t immediately respond Friday to telephone and email messages. She told the Las Vegas Review-Journal she’s still “full steam ahead” with vendors, merchandise and musical acts. Roberts broke with West last week and says he’ll appear at a party venue in downtown Las Vegas on Thursday – the night before the Life is Beautiful music and art festival begins a few blocks away.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State education officials are moving ahead with Gov. Chris Sununu’s plan to help students earn high school diplomas and college degrees at the same time, at no cost to their families. Sununu, a Republican, first announced his goal for the New Hampshire Career Academy program in January. Modeled after a privately funded partnership between Great Bay Community College and Spaulding High School in Rochester, the new statewide program also provides participants with guaranteed job interviews. Sununu signed an agreement Friday with the state’s education commissioner and chancellor of the community college system to set up the program. Commissioner Frank Edelblut said the program creates a new pathway for students, who will get career-ready educations and a head start in the job market.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The governor has signed a bill allowing the Golden Nugget casino to accept bets on most National Basketball Association games. Texas billionaire Tilman Fertitta owns the casino – and also owns the NBA’s Houston Rockets. When New Jersey lawmakers legalized sports betting last year, a provision in the law banned team owners from placing or accepting bets on any games involving their sport. It was directly aimed at the Golden Nugget and enacted over protests that Nevada regulators allow Fertitta’s casinos to take bets on pro basketball games as long as they don’t involve the Rockets. The bill Murphy signed Friday brings New Jersey in line with regulations in Nevada and Mississippi, which also allow Fertitta’s casinos to handle NBA bets that don’t involve the Rockets.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials say the state had more suicides in 2018 than any other year in at least two decades. According to data provided by the state’s Department of Health, 535 people died by suicide last year. That a rate of 24.8 per 100,000 residents and represents a 6.7% increase over the state’s 2017 suicide rate. Mental health experts told the Albuquerque Journal the 2018 numbers represent the highest suicide rate on record in New Mexico since the state began consistently keeping track in 1999. According to an analysis released by the Violence Policy Center, New Mexico had the fourth-highest suicide rate in the nation in 2017 at 23.51 per 100,000 people. Authorities say there’s an association with firearm ownership and firearms use and deaths connected to suicide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo says a multimillion-dollar initiative will restore aquatic habitats around the state. Cuomo announced the program Saturday as officials released thousands of juvenile shellfish at New York City’s Hudson River Park. The governor says the “Revive Mother Nature” initiative is the most aggressive in the country and will reintroduce millions of oysters to New York waterways. Cuomo also announced $2.8 million to restore marine habitat in New York Harbor and to expand the Soundview Park oyster reef in the Bronx River. Saturday’s event was part of an effort to create 4 acres of enhanced habitat off the Hudson River Park for 5 million to 10 million oysters. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul says the program is designed to combat climate change and advance the state as a world-class fishing destination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Police officers and barricades were in place as people for and against the removal of a Confederate monument stood on opposite sides of the street Saturday. Media outlets reported demonstrations were helds near the Chatham County Courthouse, where the monument has stood for more than a century. Chatham’s commissioners voted 4-1 in August to ask a United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter to have a plan by Oct. 1 to remove the statute. The county let the UDC install the statute in 1907. Without a plan, the county will declare it a public trespass by Nov. 1, making it eligible for removal. Monument supporter Barry Isenhour said the statue respects American veterans, but opponent Robert Finch said it was installed to intimidate the black community.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A highly publicized North Dakota Air National Guard flight to bring an infant’s heart to a waiting transplant patient in California more than 30 years ago is set to be showcased. The flight of the F-4 Phantom, a supersonic fighter, took place in December 1986 after a Lear jet flown from California to Fargo to pick up the heart broke down in cold weather. The flight took place on emergency orders from North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, who died last year. The pilot, current North Dakota Air National Guard Brig. Gen. Bob Becklund, flew the golf ball-sized organ to Stanford Medical Center. KFGO radio reports that the heart recipient, now 33, lives in the San Francisco area. The “Heart Flight” display will be unveiled this month at the Fargo Air Museum.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: The state’s U.S. senators want Congress to rename a NASA research facility after astronaut Neil Armstrong. Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown introduced legislation Thursday to honor the Ohio native by renaming the NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky. Portman says he raised the idea with Armstrong in 2012, a year before the astronaut’s death. The senator says Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, wasn’t comfortable with the attention it would bring. Portman says he has since spoken with NASA and Armstrong’s family, and they support renaming the facility. Brown says it would be a fitting tribute given Armstrong’s contributions as a test pilot and astronaut.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A public memorial is planned at Oklahoma State University to honor the late T. Boone Pickens, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to his alma mater during his lifetime. Pickens died Wednesday in Dallas at age 91. OSU says the university will honor Pickens on Sept. 25 at Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater. Pickens said last month in his annual letter to Oklahoma State fans that he checked with the school and learned he had donated $652 million over the years, with much of it going to athletic facilities. The school’s football stadium was named for Pickens in 2003 after he made a $70 million donation, which included $20 million set aside for a stadium expansion. A funeral service is also planned for Thursday in Dallas, where Pickens lived.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The 2020 election season is officially underway in the state. Thursday marked the first day for major party or nonpartisan candidates to file declarations of candidacy with the secretary of state’s office. One of the top state races is for that role, secretary of state, the second-highest statewide office after the governor and currently held by a Republican. Filing their papers as Democratic candidates were Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who in 2018 unsuccessfully tried to unseat Rep. Greg Walden, who is from a U.S. congressional district that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016; and state Sen. Mark Hass. Secretary of State Bev Clarno urged Oregonians to run for an office. Her office said there have been few candidates in recent elections, which means voters have not had many options.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new rule has gone into effect in the city requiring chain restaurants to post warning labels next to menu items that are high in salt. Warnings will be shown for any menu item that has more than 2,300 milligrams, which is the recommended sodium total for an entire day. Restaurants with 15 or more locations were required to post the warnings under the new regulation by Saturday. The legislation was signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last fall after City Council passed the requirement in 2018. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley says the labels can help customers make healthier food choices. Officials say Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of hypertension and premature deaths due to heart disease. Eating too much sodium plays a big factor.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s congressional delegation says a federal infrastructure grant will help replace and upgrade 11 bridges on a busy stretch of Interstate 95. The delegation visited the Northbound Providence Viaduct on Friday to celebrate the $60.3 million from the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grant Program. U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee member, helped design the program to meet Rhode Island’s need for funding for large infrastructure investments. The Rhode Island Democrat says a 55-year-old viaduct will be transformed into modern throughway. It carries about 220,000 vehicles daily. Construction is scheduled for late next year. Financing will come from several federal and state sources.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This little piggy should have stayed home. The State reports that for the fourth time, Leroy – a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig – wandered over to Brennan Elementary School in Columbia, leading officials to slap McGregor Wallace with citations for owning a pig within city limits and having a fugitive pet. Wallace is scheduled for a court appearance in October. Wallace says Leroy is his emotional support animal meant to help him deal with PTSD from domestic trauma. Wallace says he got Leroy several months ago to replace a standard pig that grew too big. He says Leroy is clever and knows how to open the home’s gate when Wallace isn’t home. The pig also can open the refrigerator. The 7-month-old swine is now at Columbia’s animal shelter.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An organization promoting the separation of church and state is putting up billboards in three cities to protest the state’s new law that requires all public schools to post the motto “In God We Trust” in a prominent location. The billboards from the Freedom From Religion Foundation show “In God We Trust” carved into Mount Rushmore and the four presidents saying, “There goes the neighborhood.” The drawing is from Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Steve Benson. The billboards will be up for a month in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pierre. The foundation’s president, Annie Gaylor, says its members are concerned about the law, which she says is misguided. Gaylor says the motto, adopted during the Cold War, is outdated and divisive.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee’s marching band is jumping on the anti-bullying bandwagon. The band briefly wore a T-shirt based on a design by a boy who was teased at school over the design and then offered a scholarship at the university. On Thursday, Tennessee officials offered the fourth grader a four-year scholarship beginning in the fall of 2028 if he chooses to attend Tennessee and meets admission requirements. The boy’s story went viral last week after his teacher posted on Facebook that the student’s peers mocked a T-shirt he designed for his school’s “college colors” day. After the post gained attention, the University of Tennessee’s VolShop website created its own Tennessee shirt featuring the boy’s design. School officials say over 50,000 shirts have been presold. Proceeds benefit STOMP Out Bullying.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal judge has approved an agreement that will require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a recommendation by May 2021 on whether the lesser prairie chicken should be federally protected as a threatened or endangered species. The agreement was reached Thursday between the federal agency and three conservations groups: the Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians. The groups sued the federal government in June to force it to make a designation for the lesser prairie chicken and its habitats. Once a designation is proposed, there will then be a public comment period followed by a final determination made later by Fish and Wildlife. The agency also could decide that no federal protections should be provided for the bird, which listed as threatened in 2014, but a federal court overturned the designation.\n\nUtah\n\nLayton: State Republican leaders refused Saturday to erase a bylaw to deny ballot spots for candidates who collect voter signatures instead of winning approval from the party’s caucus-convention system. The State Central Committee voted 68-40 to erase the bylaw, short of the two-thirds majority required for a bylaw change. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the bylaw threatened to keep Republican candidates off the 2018 ballot because of a state law allowing both paths. Then-Party Chairman Rob Anderson responded by declaring the bylaw illegal and refusing to oust any candidate, and Republican Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox had said then he’d certify candidates who used either qualifying method. Current party Chairman said Saturday that he won’t ignore the bylaw but that the party will do what’s necessary to get on the 2020 ballot.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Proverbs have been developed for centuries around the world, from “Strike while the iron is hot” to “Been there, done that.” They’re spread by writings, word of mouth and, nowadays, social media. The vast amount of them is evident in a new, unique library at the University of Vermont. It’s the collection of UVM Professor Wolfgang Mieder, thought to be the world’s premiere paroemiologist. The extensive library of nearly 9,000 volumes ranges from proverb collections including German, Chinese, Turkish and Hungarian to thousands of books and dissertations and includes Mieder’s own writings. Among his favorite proverbs is “Different strokes for different folks” because he says that “it tells you to realize that people have different priorities, different thoughts, different ideas.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia’s attorney general says couples planning to get married in the state will not have to disclose their race on their marriage application. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports clerks were notified of the change in an email late Friday, about a week after three couples filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state requirement. Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring wrote that circuit court clerks must ask people seeking a marriage license their race, but couples can decline to answer the question. Herring says clerks should issue a marriage license regardless of whether an applicant answers the question. The lawsuit says one county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.”\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state may seem ultraliberal, but voters in one of its deeply conservative areas have re-elected a Republican six times who thinks communists and atheists will destroy the U.S. Now Matt Shea faces a legislative investigation and calls for his resignation following media reports he was in a chat group discussing surveillance on progressives. Shea is also a major proponent of splitting Washington into two states, with Eastern Washington becoming the state of Liberty. The Army veteran hosts a weekly “Patriot Radio” show on the American Christian Network and on Facebook Live in 2017 complimented members of Team Rugged, a group that one member said provides special forces-type gun training for young men so they can “be effective in Christian warfare.” Shea didn’t respond to interview requests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Education officials say they’ve found a problem with the state’s school system – many students aren’t showing up to class. The West Virginia Department of Education released a report Thursday saying that more than 38% of schools did not meet attendance standards in the 2018-2019 school year. In a statement, schools superintendent Steven Paine didn’t give a reason for the high level of absences but said he looks forward to working with counties and local school boards to address the problem. The report also says a fifth of students statewide are considered chronically absent, meaning they missed 18 or more days of the school year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A media company that owns television stations in the state is partnering with a longtime farm charity on a live 18-hour telethon to raise money for struggling farmers. Quincy Media and Farm Aid have scheduled the event for Friday. It will include anchors and reporters from WKOW in Madison, WAOW in Wausau, WXOW in La Crosse, WQOW in Eau Claire and KBJR in Superior. A news release says volunteers will be answering phones throughout the day collecting donations to provide support, emergency relief and other resources for family farmers in the region. Farm Aid’s annual music festival is scheduled for Saturday at Alpine Valley Theatre in East Troy. The lineup includes Willie Nelson & Family, Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Bonnie Raitt, among others.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Fifty years after 14 black football players were kicked off the University of Wyoming football team for considering a protest, eight of them returned to campus to commemorate the anniversary as the school takes another step toward reconciliation. University officials unveiled a plaque Friday at War Memorial Stadium commemorating the so-called Black 14. The event capped five days of ceremonies and discussions about the infamous dismissal of all the university’s black players in 1969. The players wanted to protest racism, but head coach Lloyd Eaton would have none of the idea – and was backed up by the university’s board of trustees and Gov. Stan Hathaway. He lit into them about coming from fatherless families and said they would only be accepted by traditionally black colleges if they weren’t at Wyoming, they said. The healing and reconciliation is not complete for some of the men who came back to campus this week. Some say they struggled for years after they were labeled as members of the Black 14.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/06/pipeline-protest-victory-fireworks-fallout-worlds-tallest-horse-dies-news-around-states/117382554/", "title": "Pipeline protest victory, fireworks fallout: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: About one-third of the state’s counties, including most of its heavily populated areas, are at very high risk for COVID-19 as vaccination rates continue to lag, state statistics showed Monday. While overall caseloads and hospitalizations remain far below levels when the pandemic was at its worst early this year, the potential for infection remains elevated in areas including Birmingham, Huntsville, Montgomery and much of two regions, the Wiregrass of southeast Alabama and the Tennessee Valley in the north. Of the state’s most populated areas, only Mobile County on the coast is considered as being at low risk for the illness caused by the coronavirus, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Nearly three dozen rural counties with sparse populations also are at low risk. The statistics don’t include the July 4 holiday period, so health officials will look to see whether holiday gatherings contribute to a rise in infections later this month. With only about 30% of residents fully vaccinated, Alabama trails every state but Mississippi. Statistics from the Alabama Hospital Association show 94% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 haven’t been vaccinated. The illness has killed more than 11,350 people statewide.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state marijuana education program manager has been added to the board that regulates Alaska’s legal cannabis industry. Eliza Muse’s appointment to the Marijuana Control Board’s public health seat was effective June 25, said Corey Allen Young, a spokesperson for Gov. Mike Dunleavy. Muse replaces Loren Jones, who had held the seat since the board’s inception in 2015. The move allows Muse to serve until the Legislature next considers appointments, which will likely be sometime next year. In her public health work, Muse “has been extensively involved in marijuana education and addressing public health challenges associated with legalization,” Young said by email. Muse said she sees herself as “trying to ensure that we can find sort of a sweet spot as it pertains to ensuring that public health is preserved, safety is preserved, in this new space of a marijuana marketplace and just ensure that our regulations are always considerate of public health.” Muse, who runs a marijuana education program within the state health department, said she isn’t stepping into her role as a board member “with any sort of preconceived notion or bias” toward existing rules. She said she wants to ensure policy stays in line with research and science, “which we know to date has been lagging due to federal regulations.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state is moving to ban the use of trail cameras to take video or photos to aid hunting, with regulators saying the widespread practice runs counter to a doctrine that prey animals should have a chance to get away and that hunters should rely on their skills, not technology. The state Game and Fish Commission unanimously approved the ban during a June 11 meeting in Payson and plans to start implementing it as early as next January. Achieving the Jan. 1 target date depends on education and training, commission Chairman Kurt Davis said. Under the prohibition, cameras could no longer be placed at or near watering holes or other locations to help hunters by locating wildlife. The cameras are often triggered by motion and store pictures or videos to be viewed later. The ban wouldn’t affect cameras used for non-hunting purposes, such as viewing wildlife or protecting property. Trying to balance the use of technology while respecting wildlife is “the million-dollar responsibility of this commission,” Davis said. “That balance is the essential part of being on the commission and setting the rules that govern how we pursue wildlife.” The ban will “ensure that we protect the quality of the experience, that we protect the wildlife itself and that they are being pursued under Fair Chase Doctrine,” Davis said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state ended the fiscal year with a surplus of nearly $1 billion, more than double its previous record, finance officials said Friday. The Department of Finance and Administration said the state ended the fiscal year June 30 with a surplus of $945.7 million. Arkansas’ net available revenue for the fiscal year totaled more than $6.8 billion. The state’s previous record was the $409.3 million surplus accumulated in the 2007 fiscal year, the department said. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said this year’s surplus allowed Arkansas to grow its reserves to more than $1.2 billion and add to its Medicaid trust fund. The Republican governor noted that the state’s individual income tax collections increased over the previous year and beat the state forecast despite a tax cut that took effect this year. Hutchinson has said he plans to call a special session to take up additional tax cuts this fall. The state’s sales and corporate income tax collections also came in above the previous year and state forecasts. “This showcases the fact that a growing economy along with conservative management of our resources allows us to fund education at a high level and other state services and to cut taxes at the same time,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Air quality advisories were in effect Monday across a swath of Southern California due to hours of fireworks blasts and a wildfire north of the city. The South Coast Air Quality District said poor air quality was likely through the afternoon because fireworks emit high levels of particulate matter. The smell of smoke infused the overnight intrusion of damp marine air over the region. “June Gloom continues its tight grip on Southern California early this morning despite the turn of the calendar,” the National Weather Service said. July 4 and 5 are typically the worst days of the year for levels of fine particulate matter in the South Coast Air Basin. Breathing particulates can lead to a wide variety of cardiovascular and respiratory health effects. A smoke advisory was also in effect due to the Tumbleweed Fire burning in mountains near Interstate 5 and the community of Gorman about 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Areas adjacent to the fire were expected to experience the highest concentrations of pollutants.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed off on the creation of a new taxing district to coordinate the creation of a Front Range passenger railway up and down the Interstate 25 corridor. But while the state may have a powerful likely partner in Amtrak, the first trains won’t be ready to roll for at least a couple of years, The Denver Post reports. And the regional rail line faces potential political and cost hurdles. The new Front Range Passenger Rail District will take shape early next year and cover all or parts of 13 counties near I-25 between the Wyoming and New Mexico state lines, including all of metro Denver. The district and its appointed board will begin formalizing plans for the first stretches of the railway. It’s likely to include a route north of Denver that goes through Boulder. Money will be scarce at first, however, since the district will need to seek approval from voters within its boundaries to collect any new sales tax. Still, Polis’ signing of the legislation into law Wednesday marked a big milestone. “A dedicated railroad connecting communities from New Mexico to Colorado to Wyoming isn’t just great for our environment but, as our history shows, it will spur innovation and move people, ideas and businesses,” the Democratic governor said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Representatives of home care, hospice and home health agencies called on state officials Thursday to provide them with more funding, including a share of the state’s remaining federal COVID-19 relief money, warning they’re facing dire financial and staffing challenges. The Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, whose member agencies provide services to nearly 20,000 state-funded residents, including the elderly and medically fragile children and adults, contends the home-based sector of the health care industry has been forgotten as state policymakers focused more attention on the nursing homes and group homes. Unionized workers at those facilities had threatened to strike unless they received greater wages, benefits and protections. “We made our strong case to the Legislature,” said Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO of the association. “Yet the (state) budget fell sorely short, failing to support us through additional Medicaid funding while choosing to invest significant dollars in nursing homes and group homes.” In a statement, Wodatch said the two-year, $46.3 billion budget “sent a strong negative message that home care is not a priority” even though the sector saved the state $508.4 million in fiscal year 2019 by helping people stay out of costly institutional settings.\n\nDelaware\n\nSmyrna: Officials are set to conduct a routine quarterly test of the Salem/Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations emergency notification system. Delaware Emergency Management Agency and Delaware State Police will run the test Tuesday, with the sirens sounding about 7:20 p.m., Delaware State News reports. The 37 sirens located within 10 miles of the plants just over the Delaware border in New Jersey will be activated for three to five minutes, the newspaper reports. The siren tests will be followed by a test message of the Emergency Alert System on local radio stations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and destruction of government property after crashing a vehicle on the Washington Monument grounds Saturday evening, WUSA-TV reports. Jack Joseph Dessin, 38, of New Jersey, faces the charges, U.S. Park Police said. Multiple police units and D.C. Fire and EMS responded after an SUV hit the barrier wall that surrounds a hill atop which the Washington Monument sits at the National Mall. A man was taken to George Washington University hospital for treatment of minor injuries suffered in the crash that happened about 8 p.m., according to U.S. Park Police. The crash came only hours before the Fourth of July and in a popular place for tourists visiting the National Mall for the patriotic holiday. Photos appeared to show an American flag hanging from the vehicle, among other signs that had been placed onto it. A woman on the scene said she was almost hit by the vehicle but did not want to answer any further questions or provide additional information about what had happened. The crash is under investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: About $99 million in unspent rental aid meant to help Floridians living in affordable housing was returned to the state after the agency overseeing the program struggled to disburse the money. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation, established by the Legislature to help develop and support affordable housing, received $120 million in federal funding for rental assistance last year as part of the CARES Act. Florida used the money to set up a Coronavirus Relief Fund, intended to help tenants who lost jobs or income due to the pandemic catch up on rent at the properties that FHFC finances. Taylore Maxey, press secretary for the nonprofit, said it handed out about $13.2 million to help tenants at 373 multifamily developments across the state. In total, FHFC said it received 786 applications for assistance, but only 521 were approved. And about $99 million was returned to the Department of Economic Opportunity to be repurposed for other pandemic-response programs. “There’s no way to sugarcoat it: That strategy was underutilized,” said Trey Price, the FHFC’s executive director. “But all this considered, I think we did a good job with the time constraints we were under and the resources we were given.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some 13,000 runners took to the streets Saturday to welcome the return of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race, a Fourth of July holiday tradition. Previous years saw about 60,000 runners cross the starting line in front of Lenox Mall in the Buckhead neighborhood. This year, the race was broken into two days to help with social distancing. About 18,000 runners were expected Sunday, including four of the six marathon runners who will represent the U.S. at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. Race Director Rich Kenah said officials split the event primarily as a safety precaution to limit any potential COVID-19 exposure, WSB-TV reports. To participate, runners either had to show proof they had been vaccinated or go through a screening process for COVID-19. The race was held virtually last year. The fastest woman on the course Saturday morning, Jessica Smith, said she could not have been more excited to compete again. “We have a beautiful day, and we could not get more lucky with the weather,” Smith said. Another big change for the race was that spectators weren’t allowed at the finish line near Piedmont Park. Dan Kolber said he had been running the race for years and had no problem with the safety measures. “It was gone last year. This is the most fulfilling thing since this pandemic hit,” Kolber said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As the state slowly approaches vaccination benchmarks that will trigger loosened coronavirus restrictions, officials are extending an incentive program to get more COVID-19 shots in arms. A second round of vaccine incentives will be launched this month, Hawaii Public Radio reports. The Hawaii Department of Health said the state’s current incentive program contributed to a 30% increase in vaccinations over what was expected in June. Nearly 58% of the Hawaii’s population is fully vaccinated. Travel testing and quarantine rules will be suspended when the state reaches 60%; the governor expects that will happen by Thursday and has promised to drop those rules that day. When the state reaches 70%, all COVID-19 restrictions will be lifted. People can register for the second round of incentives – which include cars, cash and furniture – beginning July 12. The program has been funded by local businesses. “There’s been no expense to the state for the higotvaccinated.com campaign,” said Patrick Bullard of H&B Marketing, who is coordinating incentives for the state vaccination program. “It’s all been made possible through the generosity of businesses that have come forward – who recognize the importance to the community to get us to the finish line sooner rather than later.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist and agitator Ammon Bundy has been found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing and misdemeanor resisting or obstructing officers. Bundy was found guilty Thursday evening after a four-day jury trial and brief jury deliberations, the Idaho Statesman reports. He was sentenced to three days in jail. But with credit for time served, he will serve no additional jail time. Magistrate Judge David Manweiler also imposed 48 hours of community service and a $750 fine for Bundy. A co-defendant, Aaron Von Schmidt, was found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing. He was sentenced to three days in jail as well but also got credit for time served and a $500 fine. Both men were arrested Aug. 25, 2020, and charged with trespassing when they refused to leave a Statehouse auditorium after officials ordered it to be cleared. Officers ultimately wheeled Bundy out of the Capitol on a swivel chair. Bundy, best known for leading a group of armed activists in the occupation of an Oregon wildlife refuge in 2016 to protest the federal control of public lands, has tried to frame his arrest as oppression from political opponents. Bundy filed documents to run for Idaho governor in May, though he acknowledged during the trial that he isn’t registered to vote in the state. Bundy moved to Idaho several years ago.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State courthouses may end social distancing measures, and starting Oct. 1 criminal defendants may again invoke their right to a speedy trial, under new Illinois Supreme Court rules. The court issued two orders last week that essentially undo rules put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those rules included suspending speedy trial deadlines, or the number of days after which defendants may demand prosecutors bring them to trial or drop charges. Those deadlines will again come into play effective Oct. 1, a date Chief Justice Anne Burke said was chosen to give chief circuit court judges time to prepare. Decisions on whether or how to relax social distancing rules will be left up to local courts, according to the order. “It is important to note that our courts remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thousands of court proceedings have taken place via both in-person and virtual hearings,” Burke said. “However, conducting criminal jury trials has been very difficult. These two orders will help our courts prepare for a return to a full slate of jury trials.” The Chicago Tribune reports some defense attorneys at the criminal courthouse in Chicago have tried to formally demand trial on behalf of their clients during the pandemic. But judges have ruled the demands have no teeth.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Marion County prosecutor has begun a pilot program that refers certain juvenile offenders to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis. Prosecutor Ryan Mears said instead of entering into the criminal justice system, juveniles with low-level, nonviolent offenses will get a one-year standard club membership, at the prosecutor’s expense. Mears said it’s “a second chance that connects juveniles with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis, a safe place where they experience positive interactions with adults.” Mears said that “once children are introduced into the criminal justice system, it typically sets up a cycle of challenges and expectations that can impact their entire life.” Instead, he wants to help change behavior and give them opportunities to make better choices. Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis CEO and Executive Director Maggie A. Lewis said her organization’s top focus is “providing a safe and positive environment to help our city’s youth build great futures.” The Boys & Girls Clubs provide homework assistance, mentoring, sports and other programs.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: Local animal shelters are bursting with cats and dogs, and workers are pleading with the public to volunteer as foster families until the animals can be adopted. It’s a stark reversal from one year ago, when COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines drove people to adopt pets in droves, emptying animal shelters in the Quad Cities. Elizabeth Corn, director of King’s Harvest Pet Rescue, said the shelter has had to stop accepting animals altogether. “We have not been able to take any pets for at least a couple weeks,” Corn told the Quad-City Times. “We are working on getting them fixed and adopted as fast as we can. I’ve had at least eight phone calls today from people trying to surrender pets. We are referring them to other shelters.” Corn said King’s Harvest had 25 adoptable dogs and more than 120 adoptable cats. But dozens more are waiting until they meet adoption criteria. “Everybody’s in the same situation right now. It seems lately that we have an influx of people needing to re-home their pets,” she said. “On top of that, it’s also kitten and puppy season. We’re stuffed.” Bob Citrullo, director of the Humane Society of Scott County, said the shelter had a total of 235 animals, 80 of which are dogs, and 155 are cats.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Visitors to a splash park near Wichita may have been exposed to two additional types of bacteria, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The department on Friday added coliform and E. coli to the list of bacteria possibly encountered by patrons of Tanganyika Wildlife Park’s splash park, The Wichita Eagle reports. The state health department had previously reported three people who attended the park tested positive for Shigella. That number has risen to six. People who visited the splash park also have tested positive for the norovirus, sapovirus and a type of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli, the state health department said. The splash park has been closed since June 19. Also Friday, more customers joined a lawsuit against the park, alleging they became “violently ill and suffered repeated bouts of vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and fever and other symptoms due to the negligence and/or carelessness” of the park. On June 19, the park wrote on Facebook that the splash park was being closed due to a filtration system problem and that officials were “working diligently to remedy the issue.” A park official did not respond to requests for comment from the Eagle.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Almost exactly a year after his bid for U.S. Senate came up just short in the Democratic primary, Charles Booker formally launched a new campaign Thursday, this time hoping to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Rand Paul in 2022. Booker kicked off his candidacy at a rally before a few hundred energetic supporters in Louisville’s majority-Black West End, just a block from the district he represented for one term in the state House. “We’re ready to prove the doubters wrong and make history,” he said to applause at the end of a 35-minute speech. “We’re going to win this race, and we’re going to transform Kentucky, and it starts right now.” Booker formed an exploratory committee for a potential run in April, saying he’d travel the state and listen to Kentuckians to gauge if there was enough support for him to win a race against Paul, who has said he’ll seek a third term. In an interview, Booker said his campaign will build on the themes and issues of his 2020 run and the Hood to the Holler nonprofit advocacy group he formed in its wake. The progressive was a massive underdog last year in the primary against Amy McGrath, who greatly outspent him and had the backing of the national party establishment, yet fell just 3 percentage points shy of an upset. Despite also outspending Sen. Mitch McConnell in the general election, McGrath went on to be blown out by the Republican Senate leader in November – a common outcome for Democratic statewide candidates over the past decade.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fireworks returned to the city on Independence Day thanks to actor Will Smith. Smith offered to pick up the roughly $100,000 tab for the pyrotechnics over the Mississippi River after learning New Orleans didn’t plan a 2021 show, city officials told news outlets. New Orleans canceled last year’s fireworks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Smith is in New Orleans working on his latest film, “Emancipation,” which will tell the story of a slave, Peter, who escaped a Louisiana plantation and whose photo of scars on his back from being whipped exposed the brutality of slavery. He would also fight for the Union in the Civil War. Smith moved production of the film from Georgia to Louisiana in early April after Georgia passed a new voting law that prompted a federal lawsuit saying the overhaul was intended to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Former two-term Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who liked to compare himself to former President Donald Trump, formally announced Monday that he’s launching a campaign for a third term. LePage has not been shy about criticizing his successor, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, over fiscal policies and her actions during the coronavirus pandemic. “Maine faces several challenges and we must work toward building a better future based on individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and an economy which empowers everyone including our rural communities,” he said in a statement. There will be a fall campaign kickoff, he said. The Mills campaign responded by pointing to her successes in expanding Medicaid, investing in education, providing property tax relief and promoting clean energy jobs, “all while leading Maine through a global pandemic with near best-in-the nation results.” LePage’s announcement came four days after paperwork was filed with the state ethics commission. Under the Maine Constitution, he was limited to two consecutive terms but could run again after sitting out a term. He’d have to submit additional paperwork with the secretary of state’s office next year.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Fireworks were unintentionally detonated as they were being set up for an Independence Day show in the beach town, leaving employees of the fireworks company with minor injuries, authorities said Sunday. A few hours after the blast, the city announced that the day’s fireworks shows in multiple locations had been canceled out of an abundance of caution. The Ocean City Fire Department said in a news release that they were alerted to a vehicle fire Sunday morning and responded to find the fireworks that had gone off on the beach. An undisclosed number of employees had minor injuries but declined transport to a hospital, according to the news release. Numerous videos of the explosion posted to social media showed the fireworks popping and crackling near a crowded beach. A safe zone around the fireworks area prevented any beach or boardwalk patrons from being injured, the fire department said. The city said in a news release Sunday afternoon announcing the fireworks show cancellations that the cause of the discharge was unknown. “A perimeter around the fireworks site has been established and will remain in place until the safety inspections are complete, which could take several days,” the news release said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWakefield: The Massachusetts State Police have identified eight of 11 male suspects who were arrested following an hours­long armed standoff that partially shut down Interstate 95. They were charged with a variety of offenses, including unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition and the use of body armor in commission of a crime, police said in a news release late Saturday. Troopers recovered three AR-15 rifles, two pistols, a bolt-action rifle, a shotgun and a short-barrel rifle. The group refers to itself as a militia and said its members adhere to “Moorish Sovereign Ideology,” police said. One of the people arrested was a male juvenile, and two others refused to give their names. The standoff began early Saturday when a Massachusetts State Police trooper stopped to offer assistance to the vehicles he found on the side of the highway in Wakefield. Police later said they were refueling. The trooper called for backup, and most of the group went into the nearby woods until they surrendered to a police tactical team just after 10 a.m. The standoff closed Interstate 95 in the area during the busy holiday weekend, and some residents were told to shelter in place. During the standoff, a member broadcast on a social media account of the group “Rise of the Moors” that they were not anti-government or anti-police.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: President Joe Biden stayed mum on policy during a Saturday trip to the state, focusing instead on cherries – and cherry pie and cherry ice cream – and voters who were mask-free as coronavirus restrictions have eased. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer greeted Biden when he arrived midday in Traverse City, which is hosting the National Cherry Festival. They skipped the festival, however, in favor of a cherry farm in nearby Antrim County, where Biden pitched his immigration plans when chatting with two couples from Guatemala who were picking fruit. He then greeted a long line of enthusiastic supporters stretched out behind a rope. His trip was billed as part of a broader campaign by the administration to drum up public support for his bipartisan infrastructure package and other policies geared toward families and education. But the president was out for direct contact with voters and refrained from delivering remarks about his policy proposals. Whitmer told reporters she spoke to Biden about infrastructure. In recent flooding, she said the state saw “under-invested infrastructure collide with climate change,” and the freeways were underwater. “That’s why this infrastructure package is so important. That’s also why I got the president rocky road fudge from Mackinac Island for his trip here,” she said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nGlen: A family of three bald eagles that were rescued and treated for injuries in a suspected raccoon attack have been released into the wild in eastern Minnesota. Lt. Robert Gorecki, a conservation officer with the state Department of Natural Resources, released the birds Friday in the town of Glen, with help from members of the family who found the injured eagles June 21 at their Clear Lake cabin. Leslie and Ryan Donohue’s four children, ranging in age from 4 to 12, spotted two adult eagles on the ground below their nest on the family’s property. They were adults, unable to fly, suffering from wounds that Gorecki speculated may have been inflicted by a raccoon. They were taken to an animal hospital, the Star Tribune reports. An eaglet, not yet able to fly, was stranded in the nest 55 feet above. It was not injured but would have starved to death the next day or the day after, Gorecki said. The following day, an employee from Bollig Tree Service climbed the white pine and retrieved the young eagle. When he approached, another young bird, apparently a sibling, flew out of the nest and disappeared. Experts are hoping it could find roadkill or something else to eat. The nest also contained an unhatched egg, which may have attracted a hungry carnivore.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A heritage center focused on sharing the history and culture of the Chickasaw Nation is coming to the city. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the Chickasaw Heritage Center’s mission will be to interpret and explain the story of the Chickasaw Nation from the perspective of its people. The story of the Chickasaw has often been told through the lens of non-native people, said Brady Davis, the CEO of the Chickasaw Inkana Foundation. “When I refer to the Chickasaw perspective, I want to reinforce that this facility will be unique in that it tells the Chickasaw story from their perspective,” Davis said. The Chickasaw lived across millions of acres of land in northeast Mississippi, northwest Alabama, west Tennessee and southwest Kentucky. They were forcibly removed from their homeland, the heart of which is modern-day Tupelo, by the U.S. government following the Indian Removal Act in the 1830s. The facility planned will house an exhibit hall, a theater, a gift shop, a cafe, a reconstructed village area and other attractions. The center is estimated to generate $6 million annually. The foundation is seeking $16 million in state support to complete the project. The state has provided $6 million so far, according to Davis. The Chickasaw Nation will match the funds dollar-for-dollar.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson’s administration floated the idea of a statewide COVID-19 vaccination incentive program and the possibility of a “substantial grand prize” during a meeting of health officials, a newspaper reports. The Kansas City Star said it obtained notes from a June 25 Zoom meeting of the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence during which a senior state Department of Health and Senior Services official shared the concept. The notes from the meeting compiled by the center’s secretary said of a potential program: “Will likely start in July. Working with MO state lottery. 3 separate drawing structures.” Consideration of incentives comes as the fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus ravages rural Missouri. The state has one of the nation’s highest rates of COVID-19 transmission and, according to the CDC, has recently led the nation in the proportion of delta variant cases. Less than 40% of Missouri’s population has been fully vaccinated, and the figure is less than 20% in some rural counties. Asked about incentives this past week, Parson said: “Everything is on the table.” A Parson spokesperson said Friday only that work is continuing on potential incentive options. According to the notes from the June 25 meeting, educational scholarships for adolescents are also contemplated.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal officials have given preliminary approval to a conservation group’s contentious proposal to expand bison grazing on public lands in north-central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management said there would be no significant environmental impacts from the proposal covering about 108 square miles south of Malta. That sets the stage for possible final approval of the American Prairie Reserve’s plan following a two-month comment period that began July 1. The Bozeman-based group in 2019 had scaled back its original request to graze bison across more than 450 square miles following opposition from ranchers who worry about being pushed out of the area. The group’s long-term goal remains unchanged: a 5,000-square-mile expanse of public and private lands with at least 10,000 bison. Gov. Greg Gianforte criticized federal officials for scheduling a single virtual meeting, on July 21, before a final decision could be made. The meeting coincides with harvest season and as ranchers are dealing with severe drought, Gianforte said. He called for hold in-person meetings in each of the affected counties: Phillips, Choteau, Fergus, Petroleum and Valley. Massive herds of bison once migrated through the area before the animals were hunted to near-extinction in the 19th century.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Thirty state senators urged local school boards in a joint public statement Thursday to reject proposed state health standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. The standards under consideration by the Nebraska Department of Education would be optional if approved, so school districts would be free to accept or ignore them. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Students in fourth grade would be taught the difference between sex assigned at birth and gender identity. Sixth graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences among cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has drawn huge crowds to education board meetings and faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board. Supporters have said it’s important to give children scientifically accurate information. All but one of the 30 senators who signed the statement are Republicans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The title of Miss Nevada USA has gone to a transgender woman for the first time in the pageant’s history. Kataluna Enriquez was crowned the winner late last month and will go on to represent the state in the Miss USA competition in November. “It’s a huge honor to win, especially during Pride Month,” Enriquez said. “I wasn’t nervous. I knew that I had worked really hard, and I had my one shot at making history.” Enriquez, 27, took part in transgender pageants beginning in 2016 when she was working as a model. She began competing in cisgender pageants last year. In March, Enriquez earned the title of Miss Silver State USA. “I wanted to share my story and present that I was more than just a body,” Enriquez said following her March win. She spent two months designing and sewing the gowns she wore to register and compete in the Miss Nevada USA pageant June 27, including a pastel blue and pink gown evocative of the transgender pride flag and a shimmering floor-length halter with ombre rainbow sequins. “It wasn’t even in my head that the day I won was the anniversary of Stonewall,” Enriquez said, referencing the 1969 police raid and subsequent demonstrations that catalyzed the LGBTQ+ rights movement. “I felt like everything lined up. I’m thankful. We won. We made history.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: A cat has made it to the summit of the state’s 48 tallest mountains, spending parts of the journey peering out from the comfort of her owner’s backpack. Floki has grown from kitten to cat in the nine months since she and owner Mel Elam, of North Conway, started their journey to the top of the state’s 4,000-footers. Last on their list was Mount Washington, the highest summit in the Northeast at 6,288 feet, which they reached late last month. “We did it!” Elam posted on social media, where she chronicled her “Adventures with Floki,” accompanied by photos and video. Elam adopted Floki from a shelter last year after losing another beloved hiking companion, her dog. A harness is attached to Floki when she’s in the backpack, and she’s on a leash when she walks along a trail. In colder weather, she wore a vest. “There’s a lot of people that are like, ‘Oh, my gosh. Please tell me that is not it. What are you going to do next? Pease keep posting. We love following your adventures.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh no, we’re still going to be out there,’ ” Elam told WMUR-TV. Elam said she and Floki are considering the “52 With a View,” mountains in New Hampshire with elevations under 4,000 feet and great views.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPort Republic: A casino and two other restaurants in Atlantic City are saving the oyster shells left over from their diners. The state Department of Environmental Protection collects the shells, and workers and volunteers with Rutgers and Stockton universities and the Jetty Rock Foundation load them on barges and dump them into the Mullica River. That waterway is home to one of the last self-sustaining oyster populations on the Atlantic coast, according to Shawn LaTourette, the state’s environmental commissioner. The clam, oyster and other shells form the basis of new or expanded oyster colonies when free-floating baby oysters, known as spat, attach to the shells and begin to grow on them. “You have the benefit not only of ecological restoration, but it has kept 65 tons of shells out of landfills,” said Scott Stueber, a fisheries biologist with the DEP. That helps the eateries save on waste disposal costs. The program began in 2019 and currently collects oysters from the Hard Rock casino, the Knife & Fork restaurant and Dock’s Oyster House. Several other casinos have expressed interest in joining. Oysters are nature’s filters: A single adult oyster can can strain particles and contaminants from 50 gallons of water a day. In addition to improving water quality, oyster colonies also are being planted along coastlines as a shore stabilization and storm mitigation strategy.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal relief funds will be used to offer back-to-work bonuses of up to $1,000 for residents who find a job in the coming weeks and stop receiving unemployment insurance benefits, state labor officials announced Friday. The program from Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is aimed at encouraging a return to work before federal unemployment supplements expire in early September. The new support payments decline gradually from $1,000 to $400 by late July, providing a bigger payout the sooner a job is secured. The federal supplement provides an extra $300 a week on top of state unemployment benefits. “If we can make it even just one degree easier for someone to get back to work, helping offset transition costs, then we’ve got to do that,” the governor said in a news release. Some businesses have complained that expanded federal aid to the unemployed – especially the $300-a-week supplemental benefit, intended to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic – has discouraged people from looking for a job. But other factors also are believed to have contributed to the shortage of people seeking work again, from difficulty arranging or affording child care to lingering fears of COVID-19.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: After a year lost to the coronavirus, the city’s most well-known Fourth of July traditions were back Sunday. The traditional Macy’s Fourth of July fireworks show returned in full form with a display over the East River, as shells were shot from five barges in a televised, choreographed spectacle. This year, crowds were welcome to gather. The show was broadcast live on NBC as part of a two-hour special featuring prerecorded performances from artists including the Black Pumas, Coldplay, OneRepublic and Reba McEntire. Last year, because of pandemic restrictions, there were a series of shorter fireworks shows in the days leading up to the holiday, with the locations kept secret in advance to keep people from congregating. “It’s hugely significant because we’re all back together again. We were apart for so long,” said Mike Marrone, who took in the fireworks among a throng of onlookers along the Franklin D. Roosevelt parkway. The annual spectacle of gluttony that is the Nathan’s Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest also once again welcomed live audiences to watch the epic chowdown in Brooklyn. Joey “Jaws” Chestnut topped his own record by downing 76 franks and buns in 10 minutes in the men’s competition, while Michelle Lesco took the women’s title by eating 30 3/ 4 wieners and buns.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Predictions of a baby boom during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown have gone bust in the state, according to a team of researchers. Data compiled by Carolina Demography showed that birth rates in North Carolina fell by 3.1% from 2019 to 2020, in line with a national decline of 3.8% over the same period, the News & Observer reports. Carolina Demography is located within the Carolina Population Center at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Boone Turchi, an associate professor of economics at UNC, said the skyrocketing unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic likely prompted many people to wait to have children. Birth rates were falling before the pandemic. In North Carolina, birth rates decreased by 0.96% each year on average between 2015 and 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters spent the Fourth of July racing from one blaze to another as residents launched a barrage of illegal fireworks. The Fargo Fire Department issued a news release early Monday morning saying firefighters responded to 15 fires Sunday, 12 of which were fireworks-related. There were two grass fires, three dumpster fires, one wood chip fire and nine structure fires. Only one fire resulted in significant damage. That blazed burned out an apartment garage. Other attached garages saw smoke damage. The fire department also helped a person who lost a thumb and finger in a fireworks explosion. Fireworks are illegal anywhere in the city. Police responded to more than 80 fireworks complaints, the fire department said. Things were much quieter in Bismarck, North Dakota’s second-biggest city, where fireworks also were banned. Police Sgt. Loren Grensteiner said no blazes caused by fireworks were reported. “It was pretty normal for the Fourth,” he said. “We had your normal fireworks calls, but we weren’t inundated with them.” Private use of fireworks during the July Fourth holiday season was banned across the state due to widespread drought. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Refunding fines to businesses cited for violating public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic would send a “horrible” message to the vast majority of companies that followed the rules, GOP Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday as he explained why he vetoed the budget provision. The measure included in the budget by fellow Republican lawmakers would have stopped disciplinary actions against companies and refunded payment of any fines. Total fines were only estimated at about $100,000. DeWine also vetoed a Republican measure that would have allowed the House speaker and Senate president to intervene in legal challenges to the upcoming process of creating new, more representative legislative districts. DeWine called this an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers. Disappointing abortion rights advocates, the governor left in place new mandates that physicians who provide backup coverage at local hospitals as part of required patient-transfer agreements with abortion clinics must practice within 25 miles of the clinics. DeWine also left in place language allowing doctors and other medical practitioners, hospitals and insurance companies to refuse to perform or pay for procedures that violate the individuals’ or institutions’ conscience on moral, ethical or religious grounds.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: COVID-19 vaccination rates for the state’s youth have fallen below health officials’ expectations. With a little over a month left before the next school year, the Oklahoma State Department of Health is “not satisfied” with the number of vaccinated adolescents and teenagers, said Keith Reed, deputy health commissioner. “It’s definitely been lower than our expectations,” he said. “We need many more vaccinated in order to stop transmission among this group, especially when they gather back together in school settings.” The Pfizer vaccine has been available since May to children as young as 12. Only 20.1% of Oklahomans ages 12-17 have had at least one vaccine dose, and 14% are fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Nationally, 32% of the 12-17 age group has had at least one dose, Washington Post data shows. State health officials thought vaccinations of children might mirror the rate of the adult population, Reed said, because minors need permission from a parent or guardian to get a COVID-19 vaccination. About 57% of Oklahoma adults have had their first dose, and 49% are fully vaccinated. The rate of doses administered is falling in the state, both for adults and children. But Reed said minors never showed the same surge in demand for vaccines that adults did.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state on Friday reached the milestone of 70% of adults having received at least their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to officials from the state health authority. “The 70% adult vaccination goal means we have a better chance to sustain a safe reopening,” said Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “But COVID-19 hasn’t gone away. It’s our goal to vaccinate 8 in 10 people across Oregon, particularly adults in communities of color and other under-vaccinated groups.” Health officials say the state reached the vaccination goal through the efforts of more than 660 vaccination sites, operated by health care providers, community-based organizations, tribal partners, health authorities, pharmacies, volunteers, the Oregon National Guard and retired health care workers. Last week, after more than 15 months of restrictions, Oregon fully reopened, lifting mask requirements and limits on physical distancing and capacity. There are some exceptions, including federal rules; masks will still be required at airports, on public transportation and in health care settings. In addition, businesses can still require customers to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination to forgo wearing them.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police say scores of members of a group described by the Anti-Defamation League as white supremacist marched in the city over the weekend, clashing with pedestrians and setting off what were believed to be smoke bombs at one point. The group of Patriot Front members, estimated at 150 to 200 people, marched for several blocks in Center City wearing tan pants and black shirts with face coverings and carrying shields and flags. Police said they were chanting slogans such as “Reclaim America” and “the election was stolen.” Police said pedestrians “engaged members of the group verbally,” and there were several physical encounters. Finally, someone from the group used what police believe were smoke bombs “to cover their retreat as they fled,” police said. Police didn’t announce any arrests and said there were no reports of any damage or injuries during the march, which came on the eve of first lady Jill Biden’s visit to the city for Independence Day festivities. The Anti-Defamation League calls the Texas-based group “a white supremacist group” that “espouses racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance under the guise of preserving the ‘ethnic and cultural origins’ of their European ancestors.” It also says the group “participates in localized ‘flash mobs’ and torch marches/demonstrations.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The Preservation Society of Newport County is holding a series of lectures this summer entitled “Gilded Age Games” about how people amused themselves with games and sports at the turn of the 20th century. It is the first time since February 2020 that in-person lectures will be held at the Newport mansions. Each of the five presentations also will be viewable via Zoom. “Gilded Age Games” examines the games and amusements enjoyed by Americans around the turn of the 20th century, whether played around a table, outside on the field, or on the ocean. The series will also include presentations by the Preservation Society’s four Research Fellows about the projects on which they are working. The first lecture was held Thursday. The next one is scheduled for July 15 at Rosecliff. Lectures are also scheduled for July 29, Aug. 5 and Aug. 12. Attendance is free, but preregistration is required at newportmansions.org/learn/adult-programs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state’s lone Democratic U.S. House member is joining with the other six Republican members to create a trail to help link and preserve Revolutionary War sites in the Carolinas. South Carolina leaders have tried for more than a decade to create the trail that would begin near Charleston, then wind into the Midlands and Upstate, into the North Carolina mountains and Piedmont, then back toward Wilmington. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn testified last month before a House subcommittee in favor of the Southern Campaign of the Revolution National Heritage Corridor Act, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. “It is a personal mission of mine to increase public awareness of and appreciation for natural, historical, scenic and cultural resources associated with the Southern Campaign,” Clyburn said June 15. “It is my hope that the creation of this Heritage Corridor will also draw visitors to battlefields and historical landmarks located in communities across the Carolinas that are rich in history.” Among the South Carolina sites on the trail would be Charleston Harbor, Marion’s guerrilla warfare in the Pee Dee, the Cowpens National Battlefield and the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The leader of an Indigenous-led advocacy organization has gone to court to seek dismissal of charges against him related to a protest during President Donald Trump’s visit to Mount Rushmore last July. NDN Collective President Nick Tilsen claims prosecutorial misconduct and violations of his rights to a speedy trial and free speech. Tilsen was among protesters arrested during Trump’s visit and agreed to participate in a diversion program rather than face time in prison if convicted of charges against him. Tilsen claims the Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office backed out of the agreement after he spoke to the media about it in March. In his motions for dismissal, Tilsen claims his remarks to the media were protected by the First Amendment. The documents claim the state’s decision to reinstate Tilsen’s charges were directly connected to his protected speech and were reinstated as punishment for it, the Rapid City Journal reports. Tilsen’s attorneys also claim the delay in executing the agreement and then reinstating the charges violated Tilsen’s right to a speedy trial. “The prosecutor has abused their position of power and privilege to try to silence myself. These are all grounds for dismissal,” Tilsen said. “Here we are, another lie made to our people by another white man in power. And we’re tired of that.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Environmentalists and activists claimed victory Saturday after a company canceled plans to build an oil pipeline over an aquifer that provides drinking water to 1million people. Byhalia Connection said it will no longer pursue plans to build a 49-mile underground artery that would have linked two major U.S. oil pipelines while running through wetlands and under poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods in south Memphis. A joint venture between Valero and Plains All American Pipeline, Byhalia Connection had said the pipeline would bring jobs and tax revenue to the region, and it had given to Memphis-area charities and tried to build goodwill in the community. But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, Byhalia Connection said it was canceling the project “due to lower U.S. oil production resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.” Environmentalists, activist groups, lawyers, property owners, national and local elected officials, and even former Vice President Al Gore opposed the project. The pipeline would have run under neighborhoods such as White Chapel, Westwood and Boxtown, which began as a community of freed slaves in the 1860s and where homes had no running water or electricity as recently as the 1970s. Justin J. Pearson, a leader of the Memphis Community Against the Pipeline activist group, called the decision “an extraordinary testament to what Memphis and Shelby County can do when citizens build power toward justice.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Allen West, the former Florida congressman and firebrand who rode into office on the tea party wave a decade ago, said Sunday that he will run for governor of Texas in a bid to again seize on restless anger from the right. His odds are far longer this time around: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is up for a third term and may also be eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, has already locked up the endorsement of Donald Trump, whose voters West would need to have any shot at winning a GOP primary in Texas. The hurdles don’t stop there. Abbott is the most prodigious fundraiser of any governor in America, having started the year with nearly $40 million already socked away, and West is shunned by power brokers in his own party. Last month, he stepped down as chairman of the Texas GOP after spending a year using the platform to antagonize Abbott and other Republicans whom he deemed insufficiently conservative. Still, West’s celebrity in the grassroots that lingers from a combative one term in the U.S. House makes him the most prominent primary challenge Abbott has faced since becoming governor in 2015. Already there have been signs of Abbott moving to protect his right flank, passing ever-looser gun laws that he never previously endorsed and picking up Trump’s immigration mantle along the border.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Stymied by restrictions on the student newspaper at Brigham Young University, some former staffers have launched their own underground, independent publication not controlled by the school that’s owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Students writing for The Daily Universe aren’t allowed to report anything that’s critical of the school or the church, including any mention of the faith’s past support for polygamy or segregation that “could cause embarrassment” now, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Reporters should also avoid the topics of drugs, sex education, birth control, evolution and other “claims of science,” according to rules established for the publication in the 1970s that largely remain in place today. The students’ new paper, Prodigal Press, covers what happens on campus without the limitations that come with the university’s sanction. Martha Harris, a senior in the school’s journalism program who was frustrated by the “minefield of censorship, both spoken and unspoken” at the official newspaper, reported the cover story for the second issue of Prodigal Press, a piece on discrimination LGBTQ students describe encountering at the conservative Provo school. The story included Harris’ personal experiences, as someone who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, choosing a restroom on campus and being called derogatory names. The same pitch was rejected at the campus paper. The private university has a rich legacy of independent publications that started as early as 1906. The first, titled The Radical, printed one 32-page edition that called for a cafeteria on campus and more resources at the library. The requests were granted.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The tax-free purchase of feminine hygiene products, the legal requirement for sexual consent, and prison reforms protecting inmates are among new laws that took effect at the start of July. Vermont became the 22nd state to make the purchase of feminine hygiene products tax-free as of Thursday, mynbc5.com reports. “It’s taken a long time and probably a lot of federal money for other purposes to build up the courage to remove a tax on a basic necessary product for women and people who menstruate,” state Sen. Kesha Ram, a Democrat, said Thursday. The Legislature also passed a law saying a person who is asleep, unconscious or significantly under the influence is now legally unable to provide consent to a sexual act. Prison measures include the prohibition of sexual relations with prison staff and the creation of a review board to improve prison conditions. “What this does is create some mechanisms for corrections to investigate itself with a kind of internal affairs unit and also for oversight by an external board,” Defender General Matt Valerio said. Also, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in the state rose to $583, an increase of $52.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Data shows deaths in car crashes rose statewide last year, even as Virginians drove less due to the coronavirus pandemic. Crash fatalities increased by 2% from 827 in 2019 to 847 in 2020, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing data from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. “Because there was less traffic on the roadways, that seemed to, for whatever reason, encourage folks to think that they could drive faster because there was less congestion on the highways,” John Saunders, Virginia Highway Safety office director for the Department of Motor Vehicles, told the newspaper. “And when you get increased speeds, even though you may have fewer crashes, the crashes you do have are much more severe crashes because of the increase in speed.” With the July Fourth weekend expected to be busy with travelers, Virginia State Police increased patrolling through Monday at midnight. The Virginia Department of Transportation was also halting highway lane closures and many highway work zones on major roads and interstates until Tuesday to help alleviate traffic.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A 72-foot-tall totem pole that was erected more than a century ago as a tourist attraction in western Washington but has no connection with local tribes will be removed. The News Tribune reports the totem pole at Firefighter’s Park in Tacoma will be removed in about a month following a decision by the City Council on Tuesday. The totem pole erected in 1903 by local businessmen was meant to compete for tourists with a totem pole in Seattle. Two anonymous artists carved the totem pole in Tacoma at a Vashon Island lumberyard. The city’s Arts Commission in March decided to remove the totem pole from Tacoma’s municipal art collection. The City Council on Tuesday then voted unanimously to take the totem pole off the city’s historic register, where it had been listed since the 1970s. That cleared the way for its removal. The Puyallup Tribe had sought the removal. “There has been a lot of trauma, and we have to tell the true story in order to be able to heal,” said Puyallup Tribal Councilwoman Annette Bryan. Tacoma Arts Administrator Amy McBride said the totem pole will likely be cut into pieces, with a possibility a portion might go to the Tacoma Historical Society, where a display would include its full history. McBride said officials hope to commission new tribal artwork for the park.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Elementary school students across the state will receive an array of free books this summer. The state Department of Education is entering the second year of the West Virginia Blue Ribbon Book Club, distributing 258,000 books to public school children entering grades one through three. Books will be shipped by the end of this month. Teachers also will receive books in order to create lesson plans for the upcoming school year, the department said in a news release. “This year, we were able to expand the program to include our third graders, which means more books in the hands of our youngest learners,” state schools Superintendent Clayton Burch said. The book club is a partnership among the department, the Marshall University June Harless Center and the Dollywood Foundation. The department also has included a lineup of celebrity readers on its website, including West Virginia men’s basketball coach Bob Huggins and men’s soccer coach Chris Grassie of national champion Marshall.\n\nWisconsin\n\nPoynette: The world’s tallest horse has died. The 20-year-old Belgian named Big Jake lived on Smokey Hollow Farm in Poynette. Valicia Gilbert, wife of the farm’s owner, Jerry Gilbert, said Big Jake died about two weeks ago. “We would rather not remember him by a date – it’s been a traumatic event for our family,” she said. Big Jake was 6-foot-10 and weighed 2,500 pounds. The Guinness Book of World Records certified him as the world’s tallest living horse in 2010. Jerry Gilbert told WMTV that Big Jake was a “superstar” and a “truly magnificent animal.” He said Big Jake was born in Nebraska and weighed 240 pounds at birth, about 100 pounds more than a typical Belgian foal. He said he plans to memorialize Big Jake by keeping his stall empty and inserting a brick on the outside of it with his picture and name. “It’s very quiet (at the farm),” Jerry Gilbert said. “The other horses know. I think they have their own grieving time because Jake was the center of attention around here. There is a huge void. It feels like he’s still here, but he’s not.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state is making a bid to land the headquarters of the National Rifle Association. Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Ed Buchanan asked the firearms advocacy and lobbying organization in a letter released to the public last week to relocate to Wyoming from Fairfax, Virginia. The two Republicans sent the letter June 18 and as of Tuesday hadn’t heard back from the group, state officials told the Casper Star-Tribune. The letter cited Wyoming’s lack of taxes and gun regulations as reasons it would be a good home for the NRA. “We have permitless carry, the castle doctrine, anti-financial discrimination laws, permitless purchase and possession for rifles, shotguns and handguns, no registration requirements and several other pro-Second Amendment laws on the books,” the letter said. Guns are popular in GOP-dominated Wyoming, and the Legislature has sought to ease gun rules further. Wyoming is home to several firearms manufacturers including Magpul and Weatherby. The NRA already has indicated it plans to move to Texas. The group attempted to file for bankruptcy in January, but a judge dismissed the request, finding it was not filed in good faith.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/06"}]}

It was Barkley's second-lowest rushing total of the season.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nBarkley needs 418 yards over the final three games to break Dickerson's record. He would need to average 139.3 yards rushing per game to do it. That is slightly above his average of 121 yards rushing through 14 games.\n\nThen again, all three remaining opponents are among the worst in the NFL in rushing defense. The Commanders are 26th, giving up an average of 132 rushing yards per game. The Cowboys are 29th, giving up an average of 136 yards per game. The Giants are 31st, giving up an average of 144 yards per game.\n\nBut Barkley might not get the chance, and that has everything to do with the NFC's playoff picture.\n\nFor his part, Barkley understands the goal goes beyond breaking Dickerson's record, even though he would love to do it.\n\n\"I know a lot about Eric Dickerson,\" Barkley said. \"I know that he has the record. It’s been there for 40 years. Obviously, I’ve heard the talks. I know the number. I know what to get. I kind of messed around with the emotions of how I feel for it.\n\n\"But my mindset is don’t be scared of it. Embrace it. It’s there. Challenge yourself to try to go get it. But at the end of the day, the most important thing is winning football games. If (the record) is in the way while we’re winning football games, then that’s in the way. If it’s not, then it’s not.\"\n\nAnd it very well might not be.\n\nPASSING FANCY:Eagles AJ Brown had his diva moment. Then Jalen Hurts sent real message to Steelers, NFL\n\nSILENCING DOUBTERS:Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown 'tell everyone to shut up', pass Eagles past Steelers\n\nThe NFC playoff picture\n\nThe easiest path to the Super Bowl is by getting the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. That guarantees a first-round bye, and home-field advantage as long as that team is alive.\n\nThe No. 2 seed, conversely, has to play the first weekend of the playoffs, then travel to the No. 1 seed, if it's still alive, for the conference championship game.\n\nThe Eagles, Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings are tied for the top seed with 12-2 records after the Lions lost to the Buffalo Bills 48-42 on Sunday, while the Vikings, the Lions' NFC North rivals, beat the Chicago Bears on Monday night.\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni said he's not even close to thinking about the No. 1 seed.\n\n\"We can't control anything about the Lions, so our main focus is to control what we can control,\" Sirianni said. \"I know that's boring. I know that makes for zero press for you guys, and I apologize for that. But our focus is the next game. Our focus is locked in front of us. Our focus is now the Washington Commanders.\"\n\nActually, no apologies are necessary, because the possibility for the top seed exists whether Sirianni acknowledges it or not:\n\nThe Eagles don't play either the Lions or the Vikings, and they're in a different division. So the first two tiebreakers are not in play − head-to-head and best divisional record.\n\nThe third tiebreaker is common opponents (minimum of five), and it's likely that the Eagles will be tied with Detroit and Minnesota there, too.\n\nThe Lions hold the fourth tiebreaker over the Eagles based on a better conference record (8-1 for Detroit, 7-2 for the Eagles), so the Lions would have to lose one more game than the Eagles.\n\nThe Eagles and Vikings, meanwhile, are tied in conference record. The fifth tiebreaker is the strength of victory in all games. The Eagles might have the edge as of now, but the Vikings close with the Seahawks (8-6), Packers (10-4) and Lions (12-2) for a combined record of 30-12, while the Eagles' last three opponents are a combined 17-25.\n\nIn other words, the Vikings would probably win that tiebreaker.\n\nWhat's the bottom line for Saquon Barkley?\n\nIf all three teams are tied heading into the last regular-season game, either the Lions or Vikings will win the NFC North because they play each other on Jan. 5. That means even if the Eagles beat the Giants, they'll still lose the tiebreaker and end up as the No. 2 seed.\n\nThe only way that changes is if the Lions and Vikings tie in the finale, which the Eagles wouldn't be able to predict anyway.\n\nSo in that scenario, the Eagles would use the finale against the Giants as their pseudo-bye week to rest their key players and as many starters as possible.\n\nAnd yes, that most likely means Barkley, unless he's so close to the record that he could get it in the first half.\n\nOf course, the Eagles could be in play for the No. 1 seed heading into the finale if the Vikings and Lions lose before then (assuming the Eagles beat Washington and Dallas). Or if the Vikings lose before the finale, then beat the Lions. Or if the Lions lose before the finale, then beat the Vikings.\n\nIn that case, Barkley would play against the Giants for as long as the game is competitive. Let's be real: The Giants are 2-12.\n\nAn NFL record for Barkley could be hanging in the balance.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Thus far, the move has paid off in a big way.\n\nBarkley entered the team's \"Sunday Night Football\" meeting with the Los Angeles Rams among the league leaders in rushing yards.\n\nHe exits it on pace to break Eric Dickerson's decades-long single-season rushing record after enjoying a massive outing in Los Angeles.\n\nHere's what to know about Barkley's personal-best outing against the Rams and the record-breaking pace he is on during his debut season in Philadelphia.\n\nNFL WEEK 12:32 things we learned, including missteps that could cost some contenders\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSaquon Barkley stats today\n\nBarkley had the most productive game of his NFL career on Sunday night. He logged a career-high 255 rushing yards on 26 carries and added 47 receiving yards on four catches in the 37-20 Eagles win.\n\nBarkley was productive from the jump against the Rams. He repeatedly ripped off solid gains during the first half, averaging 5.6 yards per carry in the first half and keeping Philadelphia's offense on a consistent schedule against Los Angeles' opportunistic defense.\n\nOn the first play of the second half, Barkley nearly doubled his first half production. He took the opening carry 70 yards for a score, following great blocking from the right side of his offensive line and Landon Dickerson into space. He wasn't touched en route to the end-zone.\n\nBarkley continued to be an explosive playmaker from there. He logged a 31-yard catch on a third-and-10 that set up a 13-yard Kenneth Gainwell touchdown before punctuating his career-best night with a 72-yard touchdown run to seal the game.\n\nBarkley's personal-best rushing performance came just over a month after he nearly eclipsed it against the New York Giants. In that contest, Barkley opted to bow out of the 28-3 blowout to allow his teammates to get work rather than chase the record.\n\nIn the closer 37-20 contest with the Rams, Barkley remained in and managed to clear his record, originally set against Washington in 2019. He also beat his previous career-high of 279 scrimmage yards from that outing, replacing it with his 302-yard total on Sunday night.\n\nMost rushing yards in an NFL game\n\nBarkley's 255 rushing yards were the ninth-most in a single game in NFL history, and the most by an NFL player since Jonathan Taylor's 253-yard outing against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021.\n\nBelow is a full look at the NFL's single-game rushing leaders:\n\nAdrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings: 296 yards (2007) Jamal Lewis, Baltimore Ravens: 295 yards (2003) Jerome Harrison, Cleveland Browns: 286 yards (2009) Corey Dillon, Cincinnati Bengals: 278 yards (2000) Walter Payton, Chicago Bears: 275 yards (1977) O.J. Simpson, Buffalo Bills: 273 yards (1976) Shaun Alexander, Seattle Seahawks: 266 yards (2001) Jamaal Charles, Kansas City Chiefs: 259 yards (2010) Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles: 255 yards (2024) Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts: 253 yards (2021); DeMarco Murray, Dallas Cowboys: 253 yards (2011)\n\nSaquon Barkley rushing yards 2024\n\nBarkley has accounted for 1,392 rushing yards in 2024. That ranks No. 1 in the NFL, though it's worth noting that the NFL's No. 2 rusher, Derrick Henry, hasn't yet played his Week 12 game.\n\nThat said, Barkley has already had his bye while Henry has not. As such, Barkley remains on pace to lead the league in rushing yards during his first season with the Eagles.\n\nNFL single-season rushing record\n\nEric Dickerson still owns the NFL record for most rushing yards in a single season. He ran for 2,104 yards during the 1984 NFL season.\n\nOnly eight NFL players have logged more than 2,000 rushing yards in a single season:\n\nEric Dickerson, Los Angeles Rams: 2,105 yards (1984) Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings: 2,097 yards (2012) Jamal Lewis, Baltimore Ravens: 2,066 yards (2003) Barry Sanders, Detroit Lions: 2,053 yards (1997) Derrick Henry, Tenenssee Titans: 2,027 yards (2020) Terrell Davis, Denver Broncos: 2,008 yards (1998) Chris Johnson, Tennessee Titans: 2,006 yards (2009) O.J. Simpson, Buffalo Bills: 2,003 yards (1973)\n\nBarkley is currently on pace to record 2,151 rushing yards during the 2024 NFL season. That would allow him to overtake Dickerson and break the NFL record.\n\nBarkley doesn't have much room for error, but if he can stay healthy, he might have a chance to make NFL history in his first year with the Eagles — whether it's by breaking the NFL rushing record or challenging for 2,000 yards on the ground.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

He nearly broke his single-game yardage record despite not having to play much in the fourth quarter and was the catalyst for a slow-starting Philadelphia offense in the dominant win.\n\nHere's a breakdown of Barkley's excellent performance in Week 7.\n\nSaquon Barkley stats vs. Giants\n\nBelow is a look at Barkley's stats from Philadelphia's 25-point Week 7 win over New York:\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nCarries : 17\n\n: 17 Rushing yards : 176\n\n: 176 Rushing TDs : 1\n\n: 1 Yards per carry : 10.4\n\n: 10.4 Receptions : 2\n\n: 2 Receiving yards : 11\n\n: 11 Receiving TDs: 0\n\nNFL TRADE CANDIDATES:16 players who could be on the block ahead of 2024 deadline\n\nBarkley was every bit as good as those numbers indicate. He ripped off chunk games frequently throughout the contest, including a game-long run of 55 yards that saw him reach a top speed of 21.93 mph, the second-fastest speed by a ball carrier in 2024, per the NFL's Next Gen Stats.\n\nBarkley also ran with great power through the contest. He frequently tried to run through Giants defenders and drag them for extra yards after contact. The best example of that came on a 41-yard run he had near the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nBarkley's 176 rushing yards were the second-most of his career for a single game. His career-best mark of 189 yards came during his second season in 2019 against the Washington Commanders. He achieved that total on 22 carries, five more than he had in Sunday's game against the Giants.\n\nPerhaps more impressively, 176 rushing yards were the second-most in NFL history by a player against his former team. The only player to outshine Barkley was the Cincinnati Bengals' Cedric Benson, who logged 189 rushing yards against the Chicago Bears in 2009.\n\nBarkley didn't break those records, but he may have had a chance to if he played more in the fourth quarter. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni revealed during his postgame news conference that the veteran declined the option to handle more carries late in the blowout, instead deferring touches to his teammates.\n\nThat affirmed Barkley's assertion that there was nothing personal about his big performance against his former team.\n\n\"I got no hate in my heart. They got no hate for me,\" Barkley told Fox Sports' Kristina Pink. \"It's all love, it's a business. They told me to go somewhere else, and I found a new home, and I'm happy.

Barkley needs 109 yards to break LeSean McCoy's record of 1,607 yards set in 2013.\n\nIt's a mark Barkley can surpass this Sunday when the Eagles face the Carolina Panthers. Barkley, after all, averages 125 yards rushing per game.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" right guard Mekhi Becton said about the pride the offensive line would feel about Barkley setting the record. \"He treats us as if we was running the ball, too.

Follow our stories here\n\nHELPING SAQUON:Saquon Barkley: The old-school way Eagles doubled down to help him set NFL rushing record\n\nBarkley understands the feeling. He's in his first season with the Eagles after spending his first six seasons with the Giants. At 1,499 yards, Barkley has already eclipsed his career-high of 1,312 yards set in 2022. Barkley is also on pace to break Eric Dickerson's NFL record of 2,105 yards, which he set in 1984.\n\nBarkley needs 607 yards in the next five games, or 121 yards per game, to break Dickerson's mark.\n\nBut Barkley is already well-versed in the Eagles' history.\n\n\"I’m well aware of it,\" he said. \"That’s something, when I got here, I looked up the history of the Eagles running backs. I wasn’t familiar with Wilbert Montgomery. … So I even got to do a dive on him, learn about him and (Brian) Westbrook and Shady (McCoy).\n\n\"That’s your goal. You want to come in here and leave a legacy on a place, on a franchise. I had the same mindset when I was in New York. Sadly, I came up short. So yeah, I’m aware of that, but that’s not my driving factor of it. The driving factor is to win football games, put ourselves in position to make a run, and go win it all. But I am aware of the things I can accomplish.\n\n\"The way I accomplish them is by sticking to the script.\"\n\nThe Eagles' script, of course, involves Barkley heavily. And Becton, who spent his first four seasons with the Jets before signing with the Eagles in the spring, gave an idea of what it's like blocking for him.\n\n\"It’s amazing. If you give him a little crease, he’s going to find it,\" Becton said. \"I never experienced that before, and I’ve played with some good running backs, but nobody like him.\"\n\nAdded left tackle Jordan Mailata: \"We've always had good backs, but sometimes their vision, it's just not the same. Saquon, I feel like, finally − this is no shade to any back that I've blocked for − but we would watch the film back from games. What is he seeing? Oh, it was right there. Saquon sees what we see.\n\n\"Saquon is explosive, so he knows if the first read is not there, he's gonna look, he's gonna keep finding opportunities. And you know, our job as an O-line is to create as many holes as possible.\"\n\nAnd the Eagles are trying to maximize that as much as possible. That's why they signed their first true fullback in 12 years when they added veteran Khari Blasinger to the practice squad. There's a good chance he'll get elevated to the game-day roster on Sunday.\n\nBlasingame blocked for Derrick Henry in 2020 when Henry had his 2,000-yard season. Henry, now with the Ravens, is the last running back to eclipse 2,000 yards.\n\nBlasingame said he knows how the Eagles' offensive linemen are feeling, having gone through it with Henry.\n\n\"It was great to be a part of that,\" Blasingame said. \"Maybe you don’t recognize it when you’re in it, how cool of an opportunity it is. But looking back on it, to be a part of a 2,000-yard rusher with Derrick, and helping him win rushing titles – just doing my small part. It’s a blessing.\"\n\nAnd his early impressions of Barkley?\n\n\"Great teammate, welcoming dude,\" he said. \"Works hard, practices hard. I’m just excited to get on the field and do my part for him. Not just him, but all the guys here. They work hard. They put a great season together. I’m just trying to come in, hold my weight, and do my job for them.\"\n\nEagles TE Dallas Goedert, 2 others ruled out; DeVonta Smith back\n\nThe Eagles ruled out TE Dallas Goedert (knee), and safeties Reed Blankenship (concussion) and Sydney Brown (knee) for this Sunday.\n\nAt safety, Tristin McCollum will start alongside CJ Gardner-Johnson, with veteran Avonte Maddox likely serving as the third safety. Grant Calcaterra will replace Goedert. The Eagles had added veteran TE CJ Uzomah to the 53-man roster earlier in the week.\n\nThe Eagles will also get WR DeVonta Smith back after he missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, along with CB Darius Slay, who missed last week's game with a concussion.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Of course, \"it depends on your desired route and destination\" Twidale said.\n\nStill, those willing to fly on low-cost airlines such as Spirit, Frontier and Avelo can find relatively cheap last-minute fares.\n\nA one-way ticket from New Castle Airport to Tampa, Florida, for example, is as low as $61 on Avelo if one is willing to travel on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. And a ticket to Nashville on the 25th, also from New Castle, is only $41.\n\nOther modes of transport\n\nLike air travel, the number of people traveling by other modes, such as bus, train and cruise, is also projected to surpass 2019.\n\nMore than 4 million Americans will travel this way, AAA expects, compared to 3.66 million last year and 3.89 million in 2019.\n\nThe demand for cruises has also \"skyrocketed\" since the pandemic, AAA said, and \"industry is now preparing for the wave of bookings that traditionally happens at the start of the new year.\"\n\nREAD:New Castle County 911 center adds live video streaming to its emergency call capabilities\n\n“Savvy travelers know that right after the holidays is the best time to book a cruise,” Twidale said. “That’s when cruise lines offer some of the best deals, and AAA members get exclusive benefits in addition to those discounts.”\n\nDelaware, U.S. gas prices slightly lower than last year\n\nCurrently, gas prices in both Delaware and across the U.S. are slightly higher than they were last year, reflecting the reversal in the trend of falling prices that's been seen for much of 2023.\n\nNationally as of Friday, the average price of gas was $3.13, compared to $3.10 at this time last year. In Delaware, the average was $3.07 on Friday compared to $2.98 in 2022.\n\n\"Robust gas demand and elevated oil prices have jolted pump prices as the U.S. enters winter,\" AAA said.\n\nStill, national prices are down about 15 cents from a month ago, where the average was $3.28.\n\nIn Delaware on Friday, Kent County recorded the highest average of $3.071, followed by New Castle at $3.070 and Sussex at $3.06.\n\nWhile it remains unclear exactly how much prices will fluctuate between now and the New Year, AAA predicts that drivers will pay about the same or even less than they did last holiday season, when the national average on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day was $3.10 and $3.20, respectively.\n\nI'm driving. What days are best to travel?\n\nWhile AAA recommends traveling at specific times on specific days to beat traffic, drivers who travel on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Dec. 31 and New Year's Day should encounter the least amount of traffic.\n\nDec. 23 will likely be the worst day for traffic, with AAA suggesting drivers head out before 10 a.m. Traffic is expected to be bad through the early evening, or about 7 p.m.\n\nWith Delaware a pass-through state for many headed both north and south, the Delaware Department of Transportation is gearing up for many drivers on the road and reminds motorists to slow down, buckle up and be patient.\n\nGot a tip?

The Commanders were in the midst of a three-game losing streak, during which time Daniels completed 61.1% of his passes, with three touchdowns and three interceptions for a passer rating of 77.7.\n\nTOP SEED TRIALS:How Eagles can get No. 1 seed in NFC playoffs despite 3-way tie with Lions, Vikings\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nSAQUON'S CHASE:The dilemma Saquon Barkley, Eagles face as he nears Eric Dickerson's NFL rushing record\n\nThat would rank among the bottom three quarterbacks over an entire season. Daniels also averaged just 32 yards rushing.\n\nBut the reason Washington won two straight after that, and has a chance to clinch a playoff spot Sunday with a win and some help from other teams, is because Daniels rediscovered his early-season mojo.\n\nIt doesn't always work that way. Just look at Bears QB Caleb Williams, the No. 1 overall pick last spring.\n\nYet over the last two games, a 42-19 Commanders win over the Titans and a 20-19 win over the Saints, Daniels completed 82% of his passes. He threw five TD passes against just one INT for a passer rating of 116.7. Daniels also averaged 50 yards rushing in the two games.\n\n\"He’s super dynamic,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said about Daniels. \"He’s a good passer. He’s outstanding with the ball in his hands and creating. ... I just see him continuing to get better as he sees different looks and different things like that.\n\n\"I think they’re doing a great job ... adapting the offense around him.\"\n\nCan the Eagles, with the No. 1-ranked defense in the NFL, stop Daniels a second time?

Brown passing game. This week should be a Saquon Barkley running game against the 25th-ranked rush defense. A close game into the fourth quarter should give Barkley the chance for a 150-plus-yard game. It will also enable the Eagles to pull away.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 31, Commanders 20\n\nGreg Giesen\n\nAre we all happy now? Balance is restored to the Eagles' offense, at least for a week. The Commies are among the bottom third of the NFL in rush defense and have a top five pass defense. Barkley went off against them earlier this season, and we should expect another big game from the Eagles' back.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 28, Commanders 20\n\nBrandon Holveck\n\nThe Eagles are the most well-rounded team in the NFL and should be considered the favorite to reach the Super Bowl from the NFC. There is potential for an emotional letdown in the final three weeks, but I'm not overthinking it.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 31, Commanders 16\n\nBrad Myers\n\nI'm 6-8, which is great if you're playing basketball, but not as great if you're picking Eagles games. So I'm going to stop overthinking it − or stop thinking at all − and just go with the Eagles.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 24, Commanders 20\n\nTom Haines\n\nLook for Saquon Barkley to dominate early, then get a fourth-quarter breather as this game gets out of reach quickly.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 37, Commanders 17\n\nTom McGurk\n\nIf the Birds play like they did last week against the Steelers, no team on the planet can beat them. The push for the top seed in the NFC continues with this crucial game.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 26, Commanders 13\n\nTom Moore\n\nThis one probably won't be easy, but the Eagles will end up with their 11th straight win.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 31, Commanders 20\n\nTom Rimback\n\nThe top seed in the NFC is in play if the Eagles can win out. But three NFC East opponents in a row is more difficult than it seems.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 32, Washington 11\n\nBob Jordan\n\nThe Eagles would have officially clinched the NFC East title last week if the Saints had been successful on a two-point conversion against the Commanders. Wouldn't it make things fun if the Commanders stay alive for another week?\n\nThe pick: Commanders 20, Eagles 17\n\nBert Bainbridge\n\nThe last time these two teams met, the Commanders let a 10-6 lead going into the fourth quarter slip away as the Eagles scored 20 unanswered points to win 26-18. This time around, QB Jayden Daniels − the heavy favorite to win Rookie of the Year − gets his revenge at home as Washington ends the Birds' league-best 10-game winning streak. If the Commanders win and get help, they will clinch a playoff spot.\n\nThe pick: Commanders 23, Eagles 20\n\nShane Brennan\n\nThe Eagles are a second-half team, and the Commanders are a first-half team. If Jayden Daniels can get Washington's offense out to a fast start, the Birds could be in trouble. But the Eagles have been draining games away through methodical drives in the second half. The specter of a Saquon Barkley breakout touchdown will grind down a unit that isn't great against the run.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 28, Commanders 20\n\nMichelle Ganassi\n\nThe Commanders have been pretty inconsistent this season. Daniels has improved but will be no match for the strong Eagles' defense. I expect Saquon Barkley to inch closer to breaking the NFL single-season rushing record and dominate early.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 31, Commanders 14\n\nKevin Tresolini\n\nGames against Washington have tripped up the Eagles before when it seemed they were sailing along, and this venture to not-so-lovely Landover to face the well-coached Commanders is rich with alarming possibilities that could thwart the Eagles' momentum. But too much is at stake for the Birds to falter here and we foresee them winning in close, possibly dramatic fashion.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 27, Commanders 24\n\nOverall records\n\n11-3: Rimback\n\n10-4: Jordan, Haines, Holveck, Tresolini\n\n9-5: Giesen, McGurk\n\n9-4: Brennan\n\n8-6: Frank, Moore\n\n7-7: Ganassi\n\n6-8: Myers\n\n5-8: Bainbridge\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

But this is also the point when it becomes apparent who could achieve individual glory by taking down one of the game's notable records.\n\nThe biggest one that might be in jeopardy is Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson's single-season mark for rushing yards – set in 1984, when he churned out 2,105 in 16 games while with the Los Angeles Rams. There was something of an asterisk attached to it at the time as Dickerson overtook Hall of Famer O.J. Simpson, who posted 2,003 yards in 1973, when the league had a 14-game regular season.\n\nNow it's Dickerson who could lose his spot in the record book at a time when players – namely Philadelphia Eagles superstar Saquon Barkley – have the benefit of a 17th game. Despite a statistical setback in Sunday's win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Barkley still has a reasonable shot to catch Dickerson ... not that a man headed for his first rushing title with 1,688 yards is obsessing over the possibility.\n\n\"I'm fully aware of how far I am. I'm not scared of it,\" Barkley said this week. \"If I don't get it, I'm not gonna be depressed. If I get it, I'm not gonna be that crazy happy, either.\n\n\"It's a record. Records are meant to be broken. But my mindset is to focus on winning games and competing for a championship, and that's the only thing that really matters.\"\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nBut records matter, too, especially for players toiling on teams without championship aspirations. Here are 10 that might go down in the coming weeks:\n\nRushing yards, single season\n\nBarkley got a bit banged up Sunday and sat out a chunk of the game against the Steelers. His 65 rushing yards were his second-fewest in a game since he sprinted down I-95, bolting from the woeful New York Giants to join the Super Bowl-caliber Eagles. Physically, Barkley says he's fine moving forward.\n\nHe’ll need to average 139.3 yards over the final three games in order to beat out Dickerson – and it doesn’t appear Philadelphia will be able to rest Barkley much given the three-way race they’re in for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoff field. It’s a big lift, but Barkley has topped 140 rushing yards in five games this season already. It is noteworthy that he's generally downplayed the importance of breaking the record, which stands in stark contrast to Dickerson – who's freely admitted for years that he doesn't want anyone to supersede him.\n\nYards from scrimmage, single season\n\nIf Barkley is able to make a renewed push for the rushing record, then he’s probably going to also have a reasonable shot at piling up the most yards from scrimmage in one campaign. He’s 36 yards – one Barkley burst for a first down – from 2,000, which would be the 73rd instance which that threshold has been reached. (For contest, 2,200 yards has only been achieved 24 times.) He’d need to average 182 a week the rest of the way to bypass Chris Johnson’s 15-year-old standard of 2,509 combined rushing and receiving yards. Barkley’s had at least 182 yards four times so far with the Eagles.\n\nPasser rating, single season\n\nTwo-time league MVP Lamar Jackson, who could well be a three-time MVP once this season is a wrap, is very much a threat to statistically be the most efficient quarterback of all time. He currently boasts a passer rating of 120.7, which ranks as the fourth best ever at the moment but is well within striking distance of the 122.5 Aaron Rodgers posted in 2011, his first MVP season. One factor that could make it hard for Jackson is that he throws much less frequently than players like Rodgers or Peyton Manning historically have – meaning Jackson will have to be especially precise given his body of work won’t have the same statistical weight. However he did already set the mark this season for career games (4) with a perfect passer rating of 158.3.\n\nPasser rating by a rookie\n\nThe Washington Commanders’ Jayden Daniels is on track to become the fifth rookie quarterback to eclipse a 100.0 passer rating over an entire season. Currently at 101.2, a strong finish could propel Daniels past Dak Prescott’s rookie record of 104.9 set in 2016.\n\nRushing yards by a rookie quarterback\n\nDaniels is also among an exceptional group of five as the fifth rookie QB to rush for at least 600 yards, joining a list that included Robert Griffin III, Cam Newton, Jackson and Josh Allen. Daniels is 160 yards from overtaking RG3 (815 rushing yards in 2012), who won Offensive Rookie of the Year honors for Washington – another standard Daniels could match.\n\nRushing yards by a quarterback, career\n\nLast Sunday, Jackson joined Michael Vick as the only NFL QBs with 6,000 career rushing yards. With 109 more, Jackson will overtake the 6,109 by Vick, who needed 13 seasons to do what Jackson has basically done in seven.\n\nTouchdown-to-interception ratio, single season\n\nMore Jackson, whose individual numbers this season are largely more impressive than his MVP campaigns in 2019 and ’23. One of his most sublime stats is his TD/INT ratio, currently 34 touchdowns against three interceptions. If Jackson can throw at least nine more scoring strikes without being picked off, he’d eclipse what Tom Brady did in 2016 (28 TD passes against 2 INTs).\n\nReceiving yards by a rookie tight end\n\nBrock Bowers, the Las Vegas Raiders’ first-round pick in April, has already bested Sam LaPorta’s mark (86) – which didn’t stand even a year – for most catches by a rookie tight end with 90 and counting. Now, Bowers has a pretty good runway, assuming he can get some passable quarterback play, to get the 109 additional receiving yards he needs to rewrite Hall of Famer Mike Ditka’s 63-year-old record (1,076) for most by a rookie tight end. Two notes: Ditka only needed 14 games to reach his number, while Kyle Pitts (2021) is the only other rookie tight end to hit the 1,000-yard receiving plateau.\n\nReceptions by a rookie\n\nIt hasn’t been a year, either, since the Rams’ Puka Nacua became the third rookie with a 100-catch season, his 105 grabs topping Jaylen Waddle’s rookie mark set in 2021 by one reception. But Bowers can claim this one, too, with 16 more snatches. Given he’s averaged 6.4 per game, he’ll get it if he simply maintains that pace.\n\nPick-sixes in a season\n\nIt was already going to be a long shot – even more so now that the Tennessee Titans have benched second-year QB Will Levis. But this could have been a fun one to track (for everyone but Levis), given four of his 16 touchdown passes this season have gone to the other team. In order to match the seven Jameis Winston served up in 2019, Levis would need to get back on the field and gift-wrap another three pick-sixes … though it doesn’t seem like Titans rookie head coach Brian Callahan can endure any more.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter, @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/11/24/rams-eagles-live-score-updates-sunday-night-football/76476947007/", "title": "Eagles vs. Rams final score: Saquon Barkley runs for 255 yards in win", "text": "The Los Angeles Rams entered their \"Sunday Night Football\" game against the Philadelphia Eagles with an opportunity. Win, and they would be tied atop the NFC West.\n\nThey couldn't capitalize on the opportunity. Instead, they were trampled by Saquon Barkley in a 37-20 blowout.\n\nThe Eagles (9-2), meanwhile, extended their win streak to seven games and further distanced themselves from their closest competition in the NFC East. The win — coupled with the Washington Commanders' wild loss to the Dallas Cowboys earlier on Sunday — builds a two-and-a-half-game advantage in the division with six weeks left to play. The Eagles remain in contention for the NFC's top playoff seed, as well, sitting a game behind the Detroit Lions (10-1).\n\nBarkley's performance certainly will boost his MVP candidacy — if voters are willing to select a player who isn't a quarterback for the award. Barkley rushed for a career-high 255 yards (that's the ninth-best single-game total all-time) and scored two touchdowns.\n\nWith the Seattle Seahawks' win over the Arizona Cardinals (both teams are now 6-5), the Rams (5-6) entered Sunday night's game with a chance to move into a first-place tie in the division. Instead, they will hope to stay within contention until the season's final weeks when they play both the Cardinals (Week 17) and Seahawks (Week 18).\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nEagles vs. Rams highlights\n\nEagles 37, Rams 14: Saquon Barkley adds another long TD run\n\nSaquon Barkley put the game away, and attained a career high for rushing yards in a game (255), with a 72-yard touchdown run. It was his second 70-plus yard touchdown run of the game. This one sealed the Eagles' ninth win of the season.\n\nMilton Williams strip sack forces Rams to punt\n\nAfter an offensive pass interference call on Puka Nacua set up a third-and-19, Williams got pressure on Matthew Stafford. He found his way into the backfield behind Jalen Carter and Milton Williams forced the ball out of Stafford's hands.\n\nLos Angeles center Beaux Limmer recovered the ball, but the Rams were forced to punt rather than try to go for it on fourth-and-33. Time is running out for Los Angeles to make the comeback with 5:13 left in regulation.\n\nRams convert another fourth down\n\nMatthew Stafford found Tutu Atwell for a 7-yard gain on fourth-and-3. The Rams remain alive, trailing by 16 with about seven minutes left in regulation.\n\nEagles 30, Rams 14: Jake Elliott makes 26-yard field goal\n\nThe Rams couldn't stop the Eagles from scoring, but they held them to a field goal. Jake Elliott made another chip shot, his third of the night, to give the Eagles a 30-14 lead with 10:30 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nA.J. Brown closes third quarter with 28-yard reception on third-and-10\n\nThe Rams nearly got the three-and-out they needed after their missed field goal. Instead, Jalen Hurts threw an accurate pass downfield to A.J. Brown, who about doubled the length of the reception with a nice after-catch run.\n\nThe Eagles offense now has 376 yards and counting to the Rams' 199. If the Eagles can score again, it will be hard for Los Angeles to get back into the contest, which Philadelphia currently leads 27-14.\n\nJoshua Karty misses 47-yard field goal\n\nJoshua Karty was called upon to try a long field goal after the Rams' red zone drive stalled out. He missed the kick right, marking the third consecutive game in which he had missed a field goal.\n\nThe Rams offense made Karty's first attempt of the game more difficult after committing a 10-yard holding penalty on third-and-3 and allowing Matthew Stafford to be sacked on the ensuing third-and-13. Now, it will be on their defense to prevent the Eagles from extending their 13-point lead.\n\nRams convert fourth-and-1 with 29-yard pass to Puka Nacua\n\nThe Rams decided to go for it on fourth-and-1 from midfield. Rather than run Kyren Williams up the middle, Los Angeles ran a play-action pass. Matthew Stafford his Puka Nacua for a gain, and the receiver ran with Isaiah Rodgers on his back for a 29-yard gain.\n\nThe Rams are now on the 21-yard line, threatening to score again. Meanwhile, the Eagles are tending to an injury to edge rusher Josh Sweat.\n\nMike Tirico injury update\n\nNBC announcer Mike Tirico revealed on air that he is nursing a torn Achilles. The broadcast showed an angle from inside the booth that revealed he has a boot on his left foot. He assured viewers that he is doing OK.\n\nTirico did not clarify exactly when he had suffered the injury.\n\nEagles 27, Rams 14: Kenneth Gainwell scores on 13-yard touchdown run\n\nAfter a 31-yard gain from Saquon Barkley on a screen pass, the Eagles put Kenneth Gainwell into the game to spell him. Gainwell got a carry on the next play and dodged a couple of Rams tacklers on a middle-of-the-field run to get his first touchdown of the season.\n\nJake Elliott converted the extra point to extend Philadelphia's lead to 27-14.\n\nDarius Slay injury update: Eagles CB ruled out\n\nDarius Slay suffered a concussion that will keep him out of the remainder of Sunday's game, USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon reports.\n\nSlay left the field after tackling Rams tight end Colby Parkinson following a 10-yard game. He was seen walking without his helmet on the sideline and didn't return for the rest of the drive.\n\nSlay was replaced by backup cornerback Isaiah Rodgers. The veteran from UMass was called for pass interference and then gave up a 2-yard touchdown.\n\nEagles 20, Rams 14: Matthew Stafford finds Demarcus Robinson for 2-yard TD\n\nThe Rams answer the Eagles' half-opening score. After a first-and-goal run by Kyren Williams was stuffed, the Rams ran a quick pass to Demarcus Robinson with Matthew Stafford rolling to his right. Robinson broke away from cornerback Isaiah Rodgers and made the catch in the end zone with ease.\n\nLos Angeles is now trailing 20-14 and has reversed the trend of its negative-yardage second quarter.\n\nMatthew Stafford, Puka Nacua connect on highlight-reel play\n\nStafford and the Rams are looking to answer Saquon Barkley's touchdown, and he connected with Puka Nacua on a beautiful pass to get into Eagles territory.\n\nMatthew Stafford feathered the ball into an incredibly small window between Darius Slay and the sideline. Nacua made the grab going to the ground despite Slay interfering with him. The entire sequence drew an amazed reaction from color commentator Cris Collinsworth, who credited Stafford for being able to thread the needle on the throw.\n\nEagles 20, Rams 7: Saquon Barkley runs for 70-yard touchdown on first play of second half\n\nThe Eagles started the second half with a bang. Saquon Barkley found a hole on the right side of the offensive line and burst through the middle of it untouched. That turned the game quickly, as the Rams are now trailing by 13 points.\n\nThe 70-yard scoring scamper represents the second longest rushing touchdown of Barkley's NFL career. Barkley is now up to 143 yards on 14 carries, good for a 10.2 yards per carry average.\n\nEagles' all-time sack leaders\n\nBrandon Graham moved up to No. 3 all-time on the Eagles' all-time sack leaders list with his first-half sack against Matthew Stafford. Below is a look at the top-five sack men in franchise history:\n\nNo other players in Eagles franchise history have more than 57.5 total sacks to their names.\n\nEagles halftime stats\n\nBelow is a look at the Eagles' statistical leaders at halftime of their Week 12 game against the Rams:\n\nJalen Hurts: 11-of-15 passing, 101 passing yards, 35 rushing yards, 2 total TDs\n\nSaquon Barkley: 13 carries, 73 rushing yards, 3 catches, 16 receiving yards\n\nA.J. Brown: 4 catches, 69 yards, 1 TD\n\nNakobe Dean: 5 tackles, 1 sack\n\nRams halftime stats\n\nBelow is a look at the Rams' statistical leaders at halftime of their Week 12 game against the Eagles:\n\nMatthew Stafford: 7-of-11 passing, 67 passing yards, 15 rushing yards\n\nKyren Williams: 9 carries, 51 rushing yards, 1 rushing TD, 1 fumble\n\nPuka Nacua: 4 catches, 45 yards\n\nBraden Fiska: 3 tackles, 2 TFL, 1 sack\n\nMatthew Stafford sacked on Hail Mary attempt to end half\n\nThe Eagles inexplicably tried to run the ball on a fourth-and-11 with seven seconds left in the first half and failed to convert. That gave Matthew Stafford a chance to take a shot at the end-zone with just two seconds left in the half.\n\nThe issue? Stafford didn't have the time needed to get a pass off. Josh Sweat got pressure on him quickly and brought him down before Stafford could escape. That allowed the Eagles to take a 13-7 lead into the second half, where Philadelphia will get the ball first.\n\nNakobe Dean runs over Kyren Williams to sack Matthew Stafford\n\nThe Eagles' pass rush is starting to become an issue for the Rams. Nakobe Dean came on a blitz and de-cleated Kyren Williams before wrapping up Matthew Stafford for a loss of eight yards.\n\nThe Rams waved the white flag on the drive following that sack, running the ball and punting it back to the Eagles, who will have 26 seconds left to try to get into scoring range.\n\nEagles 13, Rams 7: A.J. Brown catches 6-yard touchdown from Jalen Hurts to give Eagles lead\n\nThe Eagles finally scored their first touchdown on their third red-zone drive of the day. Jalen Hurts found A.J. Brown open breaking toward the left side of the end zone, and the veteran wide out managed to catch the pass, get two feet down and take a step before defensive back Quentin Lake punched it out of his hands.\n\nThe play was initially called an incomplete pass but replay review ruled that Brown had completed the process of the catch. That, plus an extra point, gave the Eagles their first lead of the game, 13-7, with 1:27 left in the first half.\n\nBrandon Graham sacks Matthew Stafford to force second consecutive three-and-out\n\nBrandon Graham, a 36-year-old veteran who has spent his entire 15-year career with the Eagles, continues to make plays in the 206th game of his career. He brings down Matthew Stafford to bring his career sack total to 77.5 and forces the Rams to punt.\n\nGraham put a solid hit on Stafford and avoided a body-weight penalty while sending the quarterback to the ground.\n\nRams 7, Eagles 6: Jake Elliott makes 31-yard field goal to cut into deficit\n\nThe Eagles once again stalled in the red zone and were whistled for three penalties on their final set of downs before settling for a field goal. Jake Elliott once again made the kick and cut the Rams' lead to one with 6:17 left in the first half.\n\nSaquon Barkley injury update\n\nSaquon Barkley took a hard shot on a 3-yard run early in Philadelphia's second drive of the second quarter. He was able to walk off the field under his own power, but his status will be worth monitoring. He was replaced in the contest by Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nBarkley returned to the contest seven plays later.\n\nEagles stop Rams, force three-and-out\n\nPuka Nacua nearly made a spectacular catch on second-and-4 for the Rams, but he couldn't reel in a one-handed grab going to the ground. Matthew Stafford threw consecutive incompletions to end the drive, and Los Angeles kicked the ball back to Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eagles will start their next drive with good field position on their own 36-yard line.\n\nRams sack Jalen Hurts to force first punt of game\n\nThe Eagles couldn't follow up their first-drive success with a quality second drive. Jalen Hurts was chased down by Rams rookie second-round pick Braden Fiske, who brought him down for a loss of 12 yards on third-and-6.\n\nLos Angeles brought the return back to their own 21-yard line, where the Rams will look to continue their offensive success from the first couple of drives.\n\nRams lead Eagles 7-3 after first quarter\n\nLos Angeles is defending its home field well through one quarter. The Rams racked up 117 yards of offense in the first half and reached the red zone on each of their two drives. They are averaging 8.4 yards per play compared to 6.7 for the Eagles in what is shaping up to be an offensive battle.\n\nJalen Hurts (5-of-5, 47 yards) has yet to throw an incompletion while Matthew Stafford is 5-of-7 for 56 yards through the air and ran for 15 yards on a scramble. Entering the game, Stafford had negative rushing yards for the season on 10 attempts.\n\nRams 7, Eagles 3: Kyren Williams punches in 1-yard touchdown run\n\nKyren Williams atones for his first drive fumble, taking a 1-yard carry into the end zone to give the Rams their first score of the day. It marks Williams' first rushing touchdown since Los Angeles' Week 7 win over the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWilliams now has 45 yards and a score on six carries in the first quarter. He's on pace for just his second 100-yard rushing game of the season.\n\nDo the Chargers and Rams share a stadium?\n\nYes, the Chargers and Rams both call SoFi Stadium home. Rams owner Stan Kroenke built the stadium as part of the Rams' move to Los Angeles in 2016 and has rented it to the Chargers since 2017.\n\nIt is one of two NFL stadiums that is home to two teams — MetLife Stadium, home of Giants and Jets — is the other.\n\nEagles 3, Rams 0: Jake Elliott makes chip shot field goal to open scoring\n\nLike the Rams, the Eagles weren't able to find success in the red-zone after a quality opening drive. They settled for a 21-yard field goal that Jake Elliott made with ease to give Philadelphia a 3-0 lead.\n\nJalen Hurts went 4-of-4 passing for 43 yards on the opening drive while adding 11 yards on two carries. Saquon Barkley accounted for most of the rest of the offense, racking up 26 yards on five carries.\n\nEagles use 'Ronnie Stanley' call at line of scrimmage\n\nThe Eagles gave long-time Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley a shout out during their first drive against the Rams. As Jalen Hurts came to the line, he yelled Stanley's name a couple of times, presumably to communicate a call to his offensive line.\n\nKyren Williams loses fumble on Rams first drive\n\nThe Rams had a nice first drive brewing, but Kyren Williams coughed up the ball on Los Angeles' first red-zone play of the game. The Eagles jumped on it quickly to create the turnover.\n\nInitially, the officials ruled that Williams was down by contact before the fumble. Nick Sirianni challenged the play — though the officials almost missed that he had thrown the red flag before the Rams quickly ran another play — and the call was overturned.\n\nWhat is 'Heaven Can Wait'?\n\n\"Heaven Can Wait\" is a 1978 sports fantasy movie about Joe Pendleton, a backup for the Los Angeles Rams, being mistakenly taken to Heaven by an inexperienced guardian angel who presumed he was meant to die in an accident. After the mistake is realized, Pendleton is transferred into a new body on Earth, that of multi-millionaire Leo Farnsworth. The story then follows Pendleton/Farnsworth's efforts trying to get the Rams a Super Bowl, with him as a quarterback.\n\nThe movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards and was evidently a favorite of actor Rob Lowe. He cited it for inspiring his love of the Rams in a monologue during NBC's \"Football Night In America\" pregame show.\n\nRams vs. Eagles start time\n\nDate : Sunday, November 17, 2024\n\n: Sunday, November 17, 2024 Start time: 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 PT)\n\nThe Rams and Eagles game will wrap up Sunday's action for Week 12 of the 2024 NFL season with \"Sunday Night Football\" at 8:20 p.m. ET.\n\nRams vs. Eagles TV channel\n\nCable TV: NBC\n\nNBC Streaming: Peacock | Fubo\n\nNBC will broadcast the Rams vs. Eagles Week 12 clash.

SoFi Stadium is also home to the Los Angeles Chargers, who will host the Baltimore Ravens this week on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\n➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: What we love (and hate) about league's venues\n\nRams vs. Eagles weather updates\n\nSoFi Stadium has a roof, but it is an open-air stadium on the sides, meaning the weather could have a minor effect on Sunday night’s game.\n\nIt is expected to be 51 degrees during Sunday night’s game, per Weather.com. There is an 8% chance of rain, 4 mph of wind and it is expected to be cloudy and eventually foggy during the evening. Overall, the weather shouldn’t have a significant impact on the playing conditions, save for it being a bit chillier than usual on the field.\n\nEagles' playoff odds\n\nAccording to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Eagles have odds of -10000 to make the playoffs entering Week 12. That gives Philadelphia an implied probability of 99.01% to qualify for the postseason.\n\nRams' playoff odds\n\nBetMGM Sportsbook has set the Rams' odds to make the playoffs at +310. The sportsbook also offers odds for Los Angeles to miss the playoffs at -400.\n\nBetMGM's odds imply a 24.4% chance of making the postseason.\n\nPhiladelphia's seven remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .486, per Tankathon. That gives the Eagles the 16th-toughest remaining schedule among the NFL's 32 teams.\n\nThe Eagles have three games remaining against teams with three wins or fewer, so it's easy to understand why NFL oddsmakers favor Philadelphia to make the postseason.\n\nBelow is a full look at the Eagles' schedule:\n\nWith seven games left to play, Los Angeles has the 11th-hardest schedule remaining, according to Tankathon. Their upcoming opponents have a combined record of 39-29, good for a .542 win percentage.\n\nIn addition to three divisional games remaining against each NFC West team, the Rams will have to face a couple of tough opponents in the next three weeks. Los Angeles has to face two teams contending for the top seed in their respective conferences: the Eagles and the Bills. Once the Rams get through that, three of their final four games are against divisional opponents.\n\nHere's who the Rams will face over the final seven weeks:\n\nNFL defensive rookie rankings: Rams' Verse, Eagles’ Mitchell make list\n\nIf you’re looking for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year favorites, then Sunday night’s Rams-Eagles matchup is for you:\n\n1. Jared Verse, DE, Los Angeles Rams (-190)\n\nWith his mix of pedigree and production, Verse is likely to be the favorite for the rest of the regular season.\n\n2. Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Philadelphia Eagles (+320)\n\nMitchell doesn't have the same production as other defensive backs but Philadelphia's getting the attention needed to move him up the order.\n\n3. Laiatu Latu, DE, Indianapolis Colts (+2000)\n\nLatu's pedigree has him third behind Verse and Mitchell but he's pretty far out of it, barring a second-half surge in production this season.\n\nView more rankings here.\n\nWhich NFL team has the most Super Bowl wins?\n\nThe New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six.\n\nPittsburgh and Dallas have the unique distinction of playing each other more than any other team combination in Super Bowl history with three matchups.\n\nThe Rams have played in five Super Bowls — winning two, most recently Super Bowl 56 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

That's my estimate,\" the 23-year-old said.\n\nVouras has earned a very loyal following since March 2021 when he began making and selling pizza at Kozy Korner, the landmark diner on Wilmington's Union Street well-known for its breakfast and Greek food staples.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nHis \"Detroit-style,\" square-shaped pan pizzas and tomato pies are made in black, steel pans for a crispy crust.\n\nVouras said the crust for the tomato pies and pizzas is thick and resembles focaccia more than a thinner, New York-style pizza.\n\nWhich pie got the most votes:Cafe Napoli or Margherita's Pizza? The winner of our Delaware's Favorite Pizza Challenge is ...\n\nHe said it takes about five days to make the dough, which is mixed by hand. It goes through two proofs, which activate the yeast and allow the light and airy dough to rise and expand.\n\nThe pies, featured on his Instagram @nickspizza302 usually are available only for takeout at Kozy Korner Friday through Sunday. Customers order by texting Vouras at 302-547-0380 or messaging him at @nickspizza302.\n\nVouras also makes and sells pizzas, tomato pies and sometimes cheesesteaks Thursdays from 5 to 8 p.m. at Mulrooney's Tavern in Elsmere.\n\nVouras first caught the pizza bug while studying accounting at a California college about five years ago. Homesick and not enjoying his time on the West Coast, he began watching YouTube videos about making pizza.\n\nHe moved back to Delaware and began traveling to cities along the East Coast, tasting around 100 pizzas at parlors from Connecticut to Rehoboth Beach. Recently, he traveled to Italy and sampled pizza al taglio, thin pizza that chefs use scissors or shears to cut, in Rome.\n\nVouras, whose steady pizza business has begun to overwhelm Kozy Korner's kitchen, has been itching to find his own storefront for the past year.\n\n\"Kozy Korner wasn't built to do pizzas,\" he said of the diner that has roots in Wilmington tracing back 100 years.\n\nAt the former Casapulla's Catering space, he plans to install a pizza master oven he bought that heats up to 900 degrees. \"It's really high-powered,\" Vouras said.\n\nThere are no plans yet for seating and dining-in options. It will be strictly takeout.\n\n\"One reason is that's all I can do now myself. A lot of places are still having trouble finding people [to work,]\" he said.\n\nThe menu will include Vouras' Detroit-style pizzas and tomato pies, as well as \"circle\" pizza and pizza al taglio. He also plans to offer chicken cheesesteaks, sandwiches on homemade focaccia, and possibly dessert pizzas. A banana pizza he has been experimenting with has been well-received.\n\nPizza's perfect companion:Rita's Italian Ice beer? Soon you can buy it in Delaware, South Jersey and Bucks County\n\nAt the new shop, Vouras said customers can expect more hours, more availability, online ordering and the ability to call-in orders. \"I'm probably done with the texting,\" he said.\n\nRight now, Vouras said he still plans to keep making pizza at Kozy Korner and Mulrooney's while he gets his new Prices Corner storefront ready for the planned fall opening.\n\n\"I'll probably keep going for a while,\" he said, adding he would like to continue to be a part of pop-up dinners sometimes held at Kozy Korner and other locations in the state.\n\n\"I've met a lot of cool chef people. It's cool to explore.\"\n\nVouras always planned to open a business by age 27 and is grateful to be four years ahead of schedule, he observed. His Instagram has more than 4,300 followers.\n\n\"It's been incredible, to be honest. It's been beautiful how everything has turned out. Luckily, I don't think I have to worry about getting people there [to the new storefront],\" Vouras said.\n\nVouras credits his father John with helping him through the process of starting his own business. \"He said, 'Put your time and effort in and work toward something.' I've spent the last five years started researching pizza.\"\n\nAlthough he'll be out on his own soon, Vouras said he will still be connected to Kozy Korner.\n\n\"I quit the family business six or seven times. That's a joke. I'm still there,\" he said.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico Sign-up for herDelaware Eats newsletter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2023/08/29/new-delaware-restaurants-mexican-indian-street-foods-pizza-french-bakery-sausage-house/70552859007/", "title": "Mexican, Indian, French & pizza among new Delaware restaurants", "text": "Hope you're hungry.

Stay tuned.\n\n7313 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin, 302-400-PIES\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nDelaware natives Danny Basso and Tyler de Ford, two lifelong friends who bonded over a love of skateboarding and quality pizza, opened their eat-in/takeout wood-fired pizza shop in the heart of downtown Hockessin in July.\n\nStone Mill takes over the space formerly occupied by Cotti's (next to Rita's Water Ice.)\n\nThe 14-inch artisan pies are scratch-made with thin, chewy crusts and an emphasis on local ingredients. Basso said he and de Ford, who worked together in area restaurants and founded a skateboard magazine, have been operating the business for a month. They make everything in-house, visit local farmers in the Brandywine Valley for fresh produce, and plan to rotate the menu every three months.\n\nStarters include housemade fried ravioli, $10, lemon pepper chicken wings with dill ranch dressing, $12, and a Caesar wedge salad, $11.\n\nPies, including Margherita, pepperoni, bianca, pesto potato and prosciutto with burrata, range from $17 to $24.\n\nThe shop has seasonal pies such as the intriguing berry and basil; a $20 white pie topped with blackberries, raspberries, fresh mint, fresh basil and drizzled with honey; and the lemon & herb pizza, $20, a combination of thinly sliced lemons, arugula, goat cheese, mozzarella and mushrooms.\n\nBasso said the menu will change soon to reflect fall ingredients, but he wasn't ready to share too many details just yet.\n\n\"It's a surprise,\" he said. The pair post updates on specials and menu items on their Instagram account @stonemillpizza.\n\nHours are noon to 8 p.m. Wednesday to Thursday; noon to 9 p.m. Friday to Saturday; noon to 8 p.m. Sunday. The shop is closed on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n1903 Newport Gap Pike, Prices Corner\n\nNick Vouras, the fourth generation of his family to work in Wilmington's Kozy Korner diner now run by his father, is still planning to open his own pizza shop this fall near Prices Corner.\n\nVouras told us in May he hoped to be open when the NFL season kicks off. (For Philadelphia Eagles fans, the Birds' first game is Sunday, Sept. 10, at 4:25 p.m. against New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.)\n\nBut, in a recent Facebook post, Vouras said it will take a little longer than he expected to make pizza, tomato pies, hamburgers, cheesesteaks and sandwiches in the new Newport Gap Pike storefront that had formerly been home to Casapulla's Catering.\n\n\"We’re looking at a November opening maybe, early October ain’t happening now,\" Vouras wrote.\n\nVouras has earned a very loyal following since March 2021 when he began making and selling pizza at Kozy Korner, the landmark diner on Wilmington's Union Street well-known for its breakfast and Greek food staples.\n\nThe crust for the tomato pies and pizzas is thick and more closely resembles focaccia than a thinner, New York-style pizza, he said.\n\nHe also has sold his pies at Mulrooney's Tavern in Elsmere, various pop-up events around the state, and at Fusco's Italian Water Ice food truck, which had been parked in Lewes earlier this summer and is at 3924 Kirkwood Highway in the Milltown area, as well as the Fusco's stand at 610 N. Union St. in Wilmington.\n\nUpdates on Nick's Pizza can be found on the Facebook page and Instagram account @302Nickspizza\n\n145 E. Main St., Newark\n\nAlso in May, Clifford J. Murphy III, the third generation of his family to operate Helen's Sausage House in Smyrna, told us he planned to open a second location this fall in downtown Newark.\n\nMurphy is renovating the former Post House site that in recent years had been a Duck Donuts store. That site, a franchise of the North Carolina chain, operated from 2015 until shuttering in December 2021.\n\nMurphy told Delaware Online/The News Journal he was eyeing an October opening for Helen's. Demo on the Newark restaurant began in early August, according to a Facebook post.\n\nHelen's has been a Smyrna landmark for 40 years. The early morning food spot was founded in 1983 by Murphy's grandmother Helen Achenbach. It's well-known for its foods made with breakfast meats, especially its deep-fried sausage and egg sandwiches, bone-in pork chop served between two slices of white bread, and scrapple subs.\n\nIn Smryna doors open at 4 a.m. The business, mostly takeout, stays open until noon every day but Sunday.\n\nIn Newark, Murphy said the hours will likely be a little different. He is considering opening from 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. Murphy said he also has considered some late-night hours on the weekends.\n\nThere may be a few tables inside, some stools along a window facing out onto Main Street, as well as some outdoor seating, he added.\n\nHelen's in Smyrna will be closed from Sept. 2 to 4 for the Labor Day holiday. The site will reopen at 4 a.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 5.\n\nShoppes At Naamans, 3100 Naamans Road, Brandywine Hundred; honestdelaware.com\n\nHave you checked out this north Wilmington restaurant that serves Indian street-style foods? Honest Indian's Rajesh Tank says the Delaware franchise of this chain has been open since March.\n\nTank said the menu of the vegetarian restaurant is divided into segments. Signature dishes include Pav bhaji, a vegetable curry served with soft bread, and pulav, a rice dish served with spices, vegetables and herbs.\n\nThere are various savory snacks including chaat and dahi puri or puffed crispy wheat stuffed with potato, chutneys and sweet yogurt, along with sandwiches made with vegetables, sliced cheese or cucumber and green chutney.\n\nAn a la carte menu has various Punjabi or North Indian Curry options such as paneer tikka masala and paneer Makhani, and breads such as butter roti, butter naan, garlic naan, and cheese chili garlic naan.\n\nSouth Indian dishes include masala dosa; idli vada; and dosas, the rice lentil crepes that can be stuffed with potatoes, onions, and cheese. The restaurant also offers several Indian-Chinese dishes, which combine spicy Indian flavors with Chinese ingredients such as soy sauce and vinegar.\n\nHours are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday; and 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\n60 N. College Ave., Newark\n\nGreg Vogeley, owner of Drip Cafes in Hockessin and Newark, announced in April that he was planning to expand beyond coffee and breakfast. This fall, he plans to open a taqueria between East Cleveland Avenue and West Main Street in Newark that will focus on authentic-style tacos, tamales and other classic Mexican favorites.\n\nThe opening \"should be sometime around the end of September/beginning of October,\" Vogeley told Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nThe 12-seat taqueria, mostly takeout, will be next door to his Drip Cafe in Newark near the University of Delaware campus, which has been operating since 2018. Longtime Delawareans and UD alumni might remember it as the site of the old Down Under, a once-popular student drinking establishment.\n\nA little over a year ago, Vogeley said the owner of the former salon next door to Drip Cafe in Newark, let him know she would be departing the space. He had been thinking about a new restaurant concept for a while.\n\nVogeley was unsure about taking over the site since the two spaces didn't meet up in the dining room. But when he realized the two spaces met in the kitchen, he decided Roja & Verde and Drip Cafe Newark would have a shared kitchen concept.\n\n\"This is what really compelled me to move forward with this project. I am able to build a new brand while amortizing the space that I already built out five years ago,\" he said.\n\nVogeley said his family has long been a fan of Mexican restaurants. He stopped dining out, however, after tasting the Mexican cuisine that prep cook Maria Gonzalez made for \"family\" staff meals she prepared for co-workers at Drip Cafe in Hockessin.\n\nVogeley said Gonzalez's food is better than anything he tried while dining at local restaurants.\n\nHe approached Gonzalez with the idea of creating a restaurant around her food, and Vogeley said, \"She's on board.\"\n\nThe restaurant will feature homemade, fresh-pressed tortillas, tacos, and street foods like shrimp and chorizo tostadas, taquitos and gorditas. Vogeley said there are no plans to make burritos.\n\n\"I feel like our menu is distinctive enough; [it's] not what you'll normally find in Delaware,\" Vogeley said of any competition in the area.\n\nVillages at Five Points, 33323 E. Chesapeake St., Lewes\n\nLudovic and Anita Bezy, owners of the La Baguette French Bakery in downtown Dover, are planning a second location in the former Touch of Italy bakery in the Village at Five Points. According to their social media, the coming-soon Lewes bakery will offer \"authentic French breads and goodies.\"\n\nChef Ludovic Bezy graduated from Culinary Arts School in St. Dizier, France, in 1986. He was chef de cuisine at Michele’s Restaurant and was at Dover Downs (now Bally's Dover Casino Resort) for 12 years. Anita was a volunteer for the Civil Air Patrol at Dover Air Force Base from 2009 to 2016. She is retired from the ophthalmology field.\n\n94 Clinton St., Delaware City, 302-751-3700; sabatinas.com\n\nThe Delaware City sandwich shop, which opened this spring, focuses on Italian-American specialties, like \"Nonna's chicken cutlets,\" hefty meatball Provolone subs, grilled Italian hoagies along with wraps, cheesesteaks and sides like Buffalo french fries with hot sauce and blue cheese.\n\nThe owner is Lisa Ioannoni, who has been in the food industry for more than 15 years. She and her former husband started Ioannoni’s Specialty Sandwiches in New Castle. Following a divorce, Lisa decided to go out on her own and created Sabatina's, named after her Nonna (grandmother in Italian.)\n\nIoannoni, on Sabatina's social media sites, said, \"I used to spend weekdays after school and entire weekends in the kitchen with my Nonna learning how to cook.\"\n\nWhile cooking with Nonna \"was never easy, as a young woman in my teens I would just want her to give me the recipes, but she wouldn’t. She used to say that learning to cook with love takes time and cannot be rushed,'' Ioannoni said. \"She urged me to put in the time, so I did.\"\n\nHours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The shop is closed on Sunday.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico.\n\nSign up for herDelaware Eats newsletter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2024/05/03/fuscos-water-ice-a-67-year-old-delaware-tradition-now-serves-pizza/73545378007/", "title": "Fusco's Water Ice, a 67-year-old Delaware tradition, now serves pizza", "text": "For 67 years, Fusco's Italian Water Ice has been the flavor of summer in Wilmington.\n\nFor nearly all of that span, four generations of founder Francesco \"Cheech\" Fusco's family have sold one thing and one thing only at the little red-white-and-green-painted stand on Union Street: Italian water ice made with nothing but water, fruit and pure cane sugar.\n\nBut now, everything's different. Because now, Fusco's has two restaurants. And they sell three things.\n\nQuietly on the morning of Tuesday, April 23, fourth-generation Fusco's owner Joseph Staffieri turned on the lights to a former Starbucks on the edge of Stanton at 3926 Kirkwood Highway.

He wants to bring his family's water ice tradition to the rest of Delaware and beyond.\n\nLast summer, Fusco's began selling its water ice out of a trailer at the beach in Lewes during the warm season. Staffieri teamed up with Lewes brewery Big Oyster to make a lemon-shandy beer. He brought a Fusco's stand to Wilmington Blue Rocks games, where it's returned this season.\n\nFusco's also experimented with adding flavors to the menu: maraschino cherry, imported from Italy. And mango, made from blender-fresh puree.\n\nIn August, Staffieri wheeled that Fusco's water ice trailer to the parking lot of a defunct Casual Male XL store on Kirkwood Highway, about 300 feet from where the new Fusco's location now stands.\n\nAs he got talking to the customers, they told him they wished they could find Fusco's closer to where they lived. They didn't get into the city much — but they missed the simple flavor they remember from their youth.\n\nStaffieri listened. And then he signed on to open a new brick-and-mortar Fusco's in a former Starbucks in the same parking lot, complete with unheard-of luxuries like air conditioning and indoor seating.\n\nStaffieri added lactose-free soft-serve ice cream to the menu at the Kirkwood location, whether vanilla or chocolate water ice. He decorated the walls with pictures of family going back four generations.\n\nAnd then, on April 30, he added something else altogether: tomato pie, baked fresh each morning at Nick's Pizza.\n\nNick's Pizza and Fusco's Italian Water Ice is a partnership that goes back to childhood\n\nNick's Pizza is, of course, the virally popular pizza and cheesesteak shop that opened last year in a little house in Prices Corner. The shop had begun years ago as a pop-up, at the Little Italy restaurant where Nick's owner, Nicholas Vouras, had grown up. Kozy Korner, a breakfast nook owned for generations by the Vouras family, had moved to Ninth and Union by the early 1990s, just blocks from the original Fusco's.\n\nVouras and Staffieri, who grew up at their family's restaurants on the same street, had known each since way back. So when Staffieri began bringing a trailer to festivals or parking lots to sling Fusco's, he invited Vouras to sell his tomato pie.\n\nWhen it came time for the new Fusco's location, adding those bakery pies from Nick's made sense to them both.\n\nNicks' Pizza still serves its fresh-to-order round pizzas and Detroit-style pizzas at its Prices Corner restaurant, same as always, alongside french fries and multiple versions of cheesesteak.\n\nBut if you want that already-famous tomato pie from Nick's — served room temperature, thick-crusted and airy as focaccia, covered in thick grandma-style tomato sauce that fumes with garlic? Well, you have to go to one of the two locations of Fusco's.\n\nA whole pie is $16. A single slice is $3, available between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.\n\nVouras says the new system helps him plan ahead: He and Staffieri agree on the number of tomato pies in advance, and then Vouras can focus on baking his other pizzas during the day.\n\nIt also works out pretty well for Fusco's. Staffieri's been selling out of tomato pie every day since he started, he said. Nearly every table at Fusco's on Thursday sported both water ice and at least one slice of Nick's tomato pie. Some old customers were coming out of the woodwork to visit the new location.\n\n\"I haven't seen you since the peach festival!\" said a young man in a denim work shirt who wandered into the shop.\n\nLast August, Fusco's and Nick's Pizza had teamed up at the 30th annual Middletown Olde-Tyme Peach Festival, serving water ice and tomato pie together. That same combination is apparently what brought the customer running back nearly a year later.\n\n\"I had to come,\" he said. \"You're selling my two favorite things.\"\n\nOne mango water ice. Two slices of tomato pie. A mere $10, and back out the door.\n\nFusco's Italian Water Ice is located at 610 N. Union St., Wilmington; and 3926 Kirkwood Highway, Stanton. Both locations open daily at 11 a.m. when the weather's warm. Pizza by the slice until 2 p.m., or until they sell out.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

The store is in a former Starbucks off Kirkwood Highway near Farrand Drive.\n\nFor years, the family has operated a little red-white-and-green-painted seasonal stand on Union Street in Wilmington.\n\nThe menu? Water ice, of course. Soft serve ice cream. And fresh-baked tomato pie from Nick's Pizza.\n\nLast August, Staffieri wheeled Fusco's water ice trailer to the parking lot of a defunct Casual Male XL store on Kirkwood Highway, about 300 feet from where the new Fusco's location now stands. The idea for the storefront was born as he got talking to the customers, and they told him they wished they could find Fusco's closer to where they lived.\n\nStaffieri added lactose-free soft-serve ice cream to the menu at the Kirkwood location.

A single slice is $3, available between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.\n\n3226 Kirkwood Highway, Prices Corner Shopping Center; eatyummybowl.com\n\nCalled \"the ultimate Asian fusion experience,\" Yummy Bowl will offer Mongolian stir fry, \"authentic\" ramen, sushi and Korean fried chicken.\n\nAn opening date has not yet been set for the Prices Corner Shopping Center site, but social media sites say the restaurant is \"coming soon.\"\n\nYummy Bowl has taken over the former Two Claws location.\n\nThe chain offers casual lunches with build-your-own-bowl dishes, as well as stir-fry dinners. The menu includes sushi, sashimi, and maki; beef, chicken and shrimp ramen; and fried ice cream.\n\nYummy Bowl has locations in Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia.\n\n500 Delaware Ave., Wilmington; thebluebirdwilmington.com\n\nThe BlueBird, a new downtown Wilmington cafe serving breakfast and lunch, originally was scheduled to begin welcoming customers on April 22, but the opening was pushed back.\n\nThe cafe opened in early May with a menu that includes bagels, egg sandwiches, pastries and baked goods made on-site, panini, soups, salads, sandwiches, bowl dishes, and other healthy options.\n\nIt's owned by veteran Wilmington restaurateur Dan Butler and his longtime Toscana staffer Brian Walsh. The 300 Delaware Ave. cafe is located in a building owned by the Buccini/Pollin Group in what is known as the WSFS Bank Center.\n\nThe BlueBird has 60 seats indoors and seating for 60 people outside on the plaza. Lavazza coffee is served, but no alcoholic beverages.\n\nSleeping Bird Doughnuts\n\nThe owners of Sleeping Bird coffee shop off Miller Road in Wilmington announced they are opening a doughnut shop.\n\nThe shop, strictly takeout, and grab-and-go with no indoor dining, will be in the white building behind Lucky’s Coffee Shop on Concord Pike. It's next door to North Wilmington Nutrition.\n\nAccording to their social media pages, construction is ongoing on the interior but Sleeping Bird has been posting enticing photos of doughnuts. (Oh, those mocha buttercream doughnuts look delicious.)\n\nVisit their Facebook page for updates.\n\n1509 Coastal Highway (Delaware Route 1), Dewey Beach\n\nThe new, 5,500-square-foot Dewey Beach Grotto will serve as a prototype for all new Grotto Pizza buildings moving forward, President Jeff Gosnear said.\n\nThe new building features a contemporary style, including exposed ceilings and garage-style doors with screens that roll up for open-air dining. The signature Grotto look is still there, though, in the sports bar and red roofs and awnings.\n\nDewey Grotto is open Thursday through Sunday until mid-May when hours will expand. It's next door to the old (and now demolished) location.\n\n1206 N. Union St., Wilmington\n\nFrank and Colleen Pagliaro are hoping to open Anura Wine Bar in October next to FranksWine shop in Wilmington after renovating the interior and exterior of the space near the corner of Union Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nIt had last been the home of a comedy club which closed in November 2022.\n\nFrank Pagliaro has owned the building that also houses his wine/liquor store for 37 years. The space was known as Wilmington's longest-running nightclub spot and was once the home of The Alley.\n\nThe Anura name is a nod to the frog logo at FranksWine, known as Jeremiah. Anura refers to any of an order of amphibians comprising frogs, toads, and tree frogs.\n\nThe wine bar has a license to serve alcohol, and the Pagliaros plan to serve food.\n\nWoody's Dewey Beach, famous for its lump-meat crabcakes, has opened a to-go spot across the street.\n\nThe new shop is in the Ocean Winds plaza at 1905 Coastal Hwy. After a soft opening selling T-shirts and uncooked crab cakes only, the entire menu was expected to be available the week of Monday, May 13, according to a Facebook post.\n\nPopular Woody's items include all things crab, including, of course, the crabcake, crab pretzel, crab dip, crabby tots and crab soup.\n\n38015 Fenwick Shoals Boulevard, Selbyville\n\nGrilliez opened earlier this month right outside Fenwick Island on Lighthouse Road/Route 54.\n\nThe menu is huge and includes bagels, acai and pitaya bowls, smoothies, wings, burgers, chicken burgers, cheesesteaks, rice bowls, pizza, shawarma, falafel and gyros.\n\n\"Mostly American with a touch of authentic Mediterranean food,\" co-owner Khaled Ahmad said of the menu. \"There is something for everyone.\"\n\nGrilliez is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, with seating both indoors and out. DoorDash is available.\n\nHeating up:Delaware celebrity chef takes over Maryland restaurant kitchen, back soon on Food Network\n\nGet out!Dine outdoors at these restaurants in and around Delaware\n\n501 Merrimac Ave, Middletown, 302-565-1890, chilis.com.\n\nLong under construction, the Chili's location in Middletown finally cut its ribbon in late March at the Merrimac Gateway project.\n\nThe restaurant had long been anticipated in the area, after a sign appeared on a bucolic lawn last year, announcing the new shopping complex with a hotel and multiple chain restaurants.\n\nThe Tex-Mex chain, founded in 1975, is famous for its sizzling fajitas, molten chocolate cake and an earworm of a classic jingle advertising \"baby back, baby back, baby back\" ribs and a newer jingle. The chain boasts more than 1,200 locations, but the Middletown Chili's is only the second in Delaware. The other is in Newark.\n\n2136 W. Newport Pike, Stanton, 302-543-8847.\n\nStanton Mexican spot El Rodeo Loco opened quietly in February, with expansive hours and an even more expansive menu. Breakfast items range from waffles and pancakes and crepes to eggs with chorizo, and a breakfast torta featuring eggs and avocado.\n\nLunch and dinner include the expected tacos and burritos and enchiladas, of course. But El Rodeo Loco is also a hive of fusion invention and Texas can-do spirit.\n\nThis means barbecue ribs, crab cakes, seafood nachos, mango-habanero hot wings, sausage-stuffed jalapenos, and chicken-and-avocado rolls in wonton wrappers. It might mean pork chops, steaks, seared scallops, Cajun seafood boils or salmon plates. Or it might mean wild daily specials ranging from birria ramen to cactus-stuffed chicken or deviled tilapia.\n\nAnd it also means Mexican pasta — spicy, salsa-verde noodles that have long been all the rage in Mexico, where Italian food has long been incorporated seamlessly into the local flavor palette. And so if you've lived your whole life without penne verde, you needn't continue this deprivation.\n\nYou can find Patricia Talorico on Instagram , X, and Facebook.

They've scaled back their Sussex County operations to simply offer pizza, stromboli and salad.\n\nRose says her top sellers are the margarita pie and a pizza topped with spinach, ricotta and tomato. A recent, and excellent, roadie slice of this Neapolitan-style pizza had a small, brown air bubble along the rim and a crunchy crust.\n\nThe pizzeria, just off Garfield Parkway, Bethany's main drag, is a tiny spot situated between Kohr Brothers and Dickey's Ice Cream. Pomodoro is open nine months out of the year. Rose says they'll likely close for the year just before Christmas, and plan to reopen for the 2020 season around March.\n\nWhat you had to say: Gina McKinney said her favorite pizza in Delaware is \"Pomodoro's in Bethany. Hands down.\"\n\n1011 S. College Ave., Newark, 302-456-3344; mariospizzade.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: To score big near a college town, you need to be memorable. And Mario's thin and cheesy pizza has a crispy crust with a perfect chew.\n\nThe pizzeria, owned by Ciro Delprete, has been at its strip shopping center location, not too far the University of Delaware's football stadium, for about 20 years. Delprete's son-in-law Mario Censullo is the shop's manager.\n\nMario's says it offers \"a taste of New York in Newark, Delaware.\" You can get modern flavors like Buffalo chicken pizza, but the shop says the square-shaped \"Grandma's Own\" is their signature item. It's a thin, crispy crust pizza made with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, garlic and marinara sauce.\n\n\"So good you'll slap your grandma,\" says a description on their website. But, thankfully, they also add, \"please don't slap your grandma.\"\n\nWhat you had to say: Thomas Turner says his favorite pizza is Mario's.\n\n124 Fox Hunt Drive, Fox Run Shopping Center, Bear, 302-834 -3424; rivierapizzafoxrun.weebly.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Put away your cellphone and pull up your pants. There are signs everywhere at Riviera Pizza reminding customers to be polite, courteous and, well, not have droopy drawers.\n\nThe shop in the Fox Run Shopping Center, near the Acme Market and next to a nail salon, has all the sass and attitude you want in a pizzeria. And Riviera certainly knows what they're doing. They've been in business for more than 25 years.\n\nCustomers come for the golden, thin crust, classic pizza slices that are bendable, but not floppy. You can eat-in at one of the booths or take a pizza to go.\n\nJust, please, don't take money out of your bra to pay for your food. Another sign on the counter says that's a big Riviera Pizza no-no because \"no one wants your boob sweat.\"\n\nWhat you had to say: Dante Giardina says Riviera Pizza in Fox Run has Delaware's best pizza \"and it's not even close. LOL.\" Tommy Cilia's also a fan, saying he's \"been going there since I was 12yrs old.\"\n\n1706 Faulkland Road, Chestnut Run Shopping Center, near Prices Corner, 302-633-6801; littlevinniespizza.com/home.html\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: There are eight tables in Little Vinnie's pizzeria area, but don't let the size fool you. There's an adjoining eatery, Vinnie's Cafe, that's even larger.\n\nA recent lunch visit showed a steady stream of customers coming for cheesesteaks and grabbing seats for plates of pasta. But the pizza should not be missed.\n\nThe pizza's tomato sauce, savory with a very appealing hint of oregano, is spread with a light hand that keeps the very thin and light crust crisp. There's a subtle snap when you bend a hot triangle slice in half.\n\nLittle Vinnie's has pizza specials every day. Check the chalkboard above the counter. On a Tuesday visit, two slices of cheese pizza and a fountain soda was $5. Hours are bit wonky. Unlike some pizzerias, Little Vinnie's is closed Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nWhat you had to say: Amie Noel says when it comes to pizza, she craves \"a perfectly foldable slice\" at Little Vinnie's.\n\n140 E. Cleveland Ave., Newark, 302-737-2135; wfpshop.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Matt Hans started his pizza on-the-go concept from the back of a 1956 plum tomato red Ford 250 flatbed in 2010. Four years later, he moved the business into the former bait and tackle shop in downtown Newark.\n\nWooden tables, metal accents and a wood-fired pizza oven imported from Naples, Italy, are the centerpiece on the back wall. The oven, surrounded by stucco, is fueled only by wood logs and delivers 800-degree temperatures, allowing for a 90-second pizza.\n\nIn September, Hans sold the business to chef Brian Callahan, formerly of Drip Cafe and Homegrown Cafe.\n\nThe 12-inch pizzas, which feature desirable leopard spotting on the rim, serve 1 to 2 people. Any pizza can be made with a gluten-free crust for an additional fee.\n\nWe like the changing specialties like the B-52 ($19.50), a pizza made with lobster cream sauce, Asiago and fresh mozzarella cheeses and lemon parsley gremolata. Another winner was the farm fresh pie ($16.25) topped with local butternut squash, fresh mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheeses, along with rosemary and walnut oil.\n\nPizzas also can be made with dairy-free vegan cheese. The pizzeria, serving craft beer, wine and cocktails, is extending its hours. Starting next week, it will be Tuesdays through Sundays.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Fresh ingredients, amazing specials, and absolutely fantastic pizzas!\" says fan Patti Lehker Buttrey.\n\nNew Castle Farmers Market, 110 N. Dupont Highway, New Castle, 302-328-5845\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Like The Wood Fired Pizza shop, Mama Gina Pizza has limited hours and days of the week that it's open.\n\nThe pizzeria has a counter, along with tables and chairs, inside the New Castle Farmers Market. The market operates from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays.\n\nThe name can be a little confusing. A neon sign at the business says Mama Gina, but the business Facebook page and a banner at the counter has a slightly different spelling of Mamma Gina.\n\nHere you can get pizza by the slice or a whole pie \"with toppings galore.\" The pizzeria is owned by Salvatore Illiano. Pizza varieties include Philly cheesesteak and barbecue chicken. Hit up an ATM before dining. Mamma Gina is cash-only.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Mamma Gina's is awesome,\" says customer Robert K. Strohmaier.\n\nCommunity Plaza Shopping Center, 287 Christiana Road, New Castle; 302-307-4518\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: The white pizza boxes stacked at the counter signals that Little Anthony's does steady business. The slice shop, between Bargain World Beauty and Sang Hing restaurant, is in the Community Plaza Shopping Center off Del. 273.\n\nAmerican and Italian flags hang side-by-side at the eatery that's decorated with white tile. Little Anthony's offers 17-inch Sicilian-style deep-dish pizzas, but, according to News Journal readers, the traditional, thin crust New York-style pizzas are a customer favorite.\n\nToppings include grilled chicken, bacon, eggplant, meatball, Hawaiian and a Little Anthony's special of pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onion and extra cheese.\n\nSimplicity rules supreme. A $2 slice of cheese pizza marries savory tomato sauce, melty cheese with no greasy puddles and an admirable snappy crust.\n\nWhat you had to say: Michela Robins says when she needs a pizza fix it has to be \"Little Anthony's on Del. 273 for its New York-style pizza.\"\n\n1600 Delaware Ave., Wilmington, 302-654-5331; giannispizzatrolleysquare.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Don't get confused if pizza lovers still refer to this staple of Wilmington's Trolley Square neighborhood as Ciao Pizza. That was its name for more than 15 years.\n\nDue to a trademark conflict, the Esposito family in 2017 had to change the name of Ciao Pizza to Gianni’s Pizza.\n\nWhile there have been improvements to the outdoor patio and the addition of beer to the menu, the pizza remains the same high quality.\n\nThe pizzeria at the corner of Delaware Avenue and Clayton Street is one of Trolley Square's most recognizable sites. It also was one of the stops Joe Biden chose to make in April after he announced he was running for President in 2020.\n\nWhile Gianni's has flavors such as barbecue chicken with bacon and ranch dressing, Biden, a traditionalist, ordered a pepperoni pie. You can now also get pizza made with a cauliflower crust. Pizza by the slice starts at $2.50\n\nWhat you had to say: Amanda Miller picks Gianni’s as one of her favorite pizzerias in Delaware.\n\n1004 Kings Highway, Lewes, 302-645-1900; mrppizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Mr. P's is so popular on weekends that regular customers know to put in their takeout pizza orders hours ahead of time.\n\nYou'll see the orders, written on green pieces of paper, hanging on a line near the wood-fired pizza Ambrogi oven that was handcrafted in Italy. It fires up to around 900 degrees.\n\nMr. P's is named after former owner John Perrin, who had owned the Il Forno Pizzerias in Gaithersburg, Bethesda and Frederick, Maryland. It's now owned by Rick Thomas who worked and later owned some of the Il Forno sites.\n\nBe patient at Mr. P's. The pizzeria/restaurant has only one pizza cook and one oven. They can only bake so many pizzas at one time.\n\nStill, Mr. P's, open since 2000, has legions of fans coming for the pies that are created with hand-tossed dough and chunky tomato sauce that is made in-house. Slices are available daily, but only until just before, or slightly after, 3 p.m. A recent slice of pepperoni was on the floppy side. This is a cash-only business, though there is an ATM on site.\n\nWhat you had to say: Gene Kulesza used a heart emoji to express his love for Mr. P’s.\n\n2667 Kirkwood Highway, Meadowood Shopping Center, near Newark, 302-731-8200; argillabrewing.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Argilla Brewing Co @ Pietro’s Pizza is not so much a pizzeria as it is a restaurant, bar and a very good brewery. But it has pizzeria roots.\n\nWhen owner Steve Powell owned Argilla in March 2012 in the Meadowood Shopping Center near Newark, the avid home brewer who has been dabbling in beer making for eight years, wanted to showcase his skills. He renovated the former Grey Fox Restaurant and Pub and Argilla became, at that time, the state’s smallest brewery.\n\nPizza is the perfect pairing with beer and it's a main offering at Argilla. If the Pietro’s name sounds familiar, you might have been acquainted with Powell's family’s former takeout business.\n\nPietro’s Pizza was founded by Steve’s father, Rodger Powell in 1978. The pizzeria opened on Greenbank Road in Prices Corner, had a storefront on Churchmans Road and later moved to Pike Creek. For more than 20 years, Pietro’s was a four-table shop in a strip shopping center off New Linden Hill Road.\n\nWhen that operation closed, the Powells moved the eatery to the Kirkwood Highway building. The Pietro's sign hangs in the dining room.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Argilla Brewing Co. at Pietro's Pizza is my favorite and go-to place for a pie,\" says Herb Crowe. \"My favorite is a pork and pepper pie.\"\n\n831 N. Market St., Wilmington, 302-655-1427; dimeospizzaiuolinapulitani.netwaiter.com/wilmington/about\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: DiMeo’s, a Neapolitan-inspired pizzeria and restaurant, has been a part of Market Street since 2011.\n\nBusiness during the week is brisk at lunch with downtown office workers looking for grab-and-go slices from a large selection on the counter.\n\nLarge stacks of white paper plates are ready for those seeking an interesting wedge of taco pizza or a triangle spread with fig jam, and topped with mozzarella, prosciutto di parma, arugula and truffle oil. The crust has good crackle.\n\nFather-and-son team Pino and Antimo DiMeo were originally running the restaurant. Pino DiMeo has not been involved in running the Wilmington location since 2012.\n\nAntimo DiMeo is now executive chef at the nearby Bardea restaurant that was nominated for a James Beard Award in 2018 as one of the country's best new restaurants.\n\nWhat you had to say: Lisa Cirillo McInnis says her favorite DiMeo's Pizza is the \"one with spinach and mushrooms that is out of this world. You MUST try it.\"\n\nConcord Mall, 302-478-8288; caferivierade.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: A red neon sign announces you've arrived at Cafe Riviera, a Delaware favorite for nearly 40 years.\n\nMichael J. Tumolo has run this family pizzeria and restaurant inside the Concord Mall since 1981. An inviting selection of pizzas-by-the-slice awaits on the counter, there's also seating in the adjoining dining room, in an second floor area and outside of the eatery. They'll slide a slice into the oven while you wait\n\nTumolo also has the food truck Pizzeria Pronto. Cafe Riviera expanded recently and Michael's son Dan is now running La Pizzeria Metro, a new and excellent pizzeria off Miller Road next to Wilmington Brew Works.\n\nWhat you had to say: Café Riviera in the Concord Mall is Jeremy Kramlik's first choice when it comes to First State pizza.\n\n366 Possum Park Road, Newark, 302-737-2411; ilovetonyscafe.com/\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Italian-born owner Luigi Illiano has been making pizza at Tony's Cafe since 2002. He serves a Neapolitan-style pie and uses fresh ingredients. Obsessed with quality, Illiano says he doesn't have any freezers.\n\nSo what is Tony's most popular pie?\n\n\"There's too many to name,\" Illiano says, though he concedes that the \"grandmom\" is probably the biggest seller.\n\nCustomers also like Tony's crab pizza.\n\nWhat you had to say: Adrienne Little says when she wants some 'za, she goes to \"Tony’s Cafe near Newark! Great pizzas!\"\n\nNewport Plaza, 218 Market St., Newport, 302-998-7154; ilovedomspizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Owner Dom Filingeri has owned his Newport shop since 2005. He serves \"100 percent New York-style\" pizza.\n\nIf you're lucky, you just might see Filingeri flipping and spinning dough behind the counter. He says loyal customers like the shop's \"overall authenticity. It's craft pizza.\" Filnigeri is also a stickler for consistency. Slices taste and look the same way every day.\n\nFilingeri cooks his pizza on a stone. He says the dough is thin, hand-stretched, crispy and little puffy.\n\nHis most popular pies are cheese and chicken parmigiana, but those who want to go beyond the norm should try the grilled chicken Caesar (a white pizza with chicken, Romaine lettuce and Pecorino Romano). Pie can also be topped with everything from fried eggplant to hot banana peppers.\n\nWhat you had to say: Wayne Vaughn said, \"Dom's is the best, hands down. Best wings too!\"\n\nTwo locations: 8 N. First St. and 71 Rehoboth Ave., both in Rehoboth; nicolapizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: Owner Nicholas Caggiano gave Delaware's pizza culture the Nic-o-Boli, the First State's version of the stromboli. And it remains one of Delaware's most popular fast eats.\n\nGiven the number of customers usually waiting for tables in summer months, Caggiano's two Rehoboth eateries are among the most trusted and nostalgic stops in the Sussex County sandtown when it comes to a pizza pit stop.\n\nNicola Pizza has called Delaware home since 1971. The pizzerias remain an unstoppable force, despite the 2017 death of Joan Caggiano, Nicholas' wife. Joan Caggiano was a fixture in the business, frequently stopping by tables and making customers feel like family.\n\nNicolas Caggiano and son Nick Jr., Joan's son, continue on with the daily operations at the charming flagship operation at 8 N. First St., which hasn't changed much over the years, as well as the second location on Rehoboth Avenue that opened in 2010.\n\nNicola has grown from 17 seats in its original location to 400 seats overall. The pizza crust is crunchy, and maybe a little thicker than traditional New York-style.\n\nCelebrity photos fill the walls at the flagship shop and in recent years rock star Dave Grohl has been spotted eating at Nicola Pizza and taking photos with fans.\n\nWhat you had to say: Nicola’s in Rehoboth has the heart of Amanda Hart.\n\nMultiple locations in Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania; grottopizza.com\n\nWhy this is a nice slice: So much sentimental affection, and arguments, surround Grotto Pizza, the old-school, go-to Delaware-based chain that's been around for almost 60 years.\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in 1960 by Dominick Pulieri, along with his brother-in-law, Joe, and sister Mary Jean Paglianite. At the first take-out stand, pizza slices sold for 20 cents.\n\nA second Grotto Pizza on the Rehoboth boardwalk opened in 1963. The chain now has more than 20 locations.\n\nGROTTO:Grotto Pizza's super-secret dough recipe; 10 more fun facts about Delaware's best known pizza\n\nSince 1960, only about a dozen people have been told the dough recipe — and they each had to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe pies feature cheddar cheese, which is sprinkled on first, and then the sweet-tasting tomato sauce is applied in a signature swirl. The use of cheddar, rather than traditional mozzarella, gives the Grotto pie its distinctive taste. (And blotting the top of a slice with a napkin to soak up \"cheese juice\" is a Grotto Pizza tradition.)\n\nPeople either loved the Grotto Pizza combinations or can't understand the appeal. There seems to be no middle ground.\n\nOur favorite is easily the beachside boardwalk pizza at the original site on Rehoboth Avenue. We'll chalk it up to the salt in the air, the sounds of the crashing sea, the squawking, and sometimes dive bombing, gulls. One bite brings back warm summer memories and adventures with family and friends.\n\nWhat you had to say: \"Grotto's or nothing,\" says Lacy Serman Farmer.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/real-estate/2022/08/01/how-the-3-oldest-shopping-centers-in-the-okc-area-hung-on-for-so-long/65374712007/", "title": "How the 3 oldest shopping centers in the OKC area hung on for so ...", "text": "Stores slog through slumps, or slip into oblivion.\n\nRestaurants rally or rest in peace, eventually.\n\nEntertainment? Even venerable venues vacate premises sometimes.\n\nIt can get rough out there for retail. So how did the three oldest, continuously operated shopping centers in the Oklahoma City area hang on for generation after generation? They're about as different from one another as Neiman Marcus is from a Hobby Lobby, or McDonald's is from, say, P.F. Chang's.\n\nThey are:\n\nCampus Corner in Norman, dating to 1917.\n\nMayfair Village Shopping Center, NW 50 and N May Avenue, which was Oklahoma City's original retail corridor, started in 1948.\n\nPark Estates, at NE 36 and N Kelley Avenue, started in 1951.\n\nEach one withstood the test of time for different reasons, and The Oklahoman reviewed the history, and memories, for each location.\n\nCampus Corner has been a retail boomer for Sooners just off the University of Oklahoma campus in Norman for 105 years\n\nMore than a century ago, Campus Corner started to develop to meet the needs and desires of the closest market: OU students and faculty. And over 100 years later, many are still enjoying the district and hold fond memories from their time in Norman.\n\n\"Within the next 20 years, the Corner was thriving and had emerged as the center of all activities for the University community,\" according to the Campus Corner website. \"Restaurants, clothing stores, laundry facilities, pharmacies, and beauty salons were just a few of the merchants located in the corner.\"\n\nNow, spanning four blocks adjacent to campus, \"Campus Corner is the heart of Norman’s game day activities ... and houses the best shopping, dining and nightlife in town,\" the website claims. \"Expect to find the entire city here on a college game day as Campus Corner is where all the action is aside from the field.\"\n\nCampus Corner's 225,000 square feet of stores, bars, and restaurants, marketed by Norman's Equity Commercial Realty, are as full as a college freshman's backpack: no vacancy, according to Price Edwards. The latest addition is a Raising Canes, which just leased the former Coolgreens space at 765 Asp in a deal handled by Mark Inman with CBRE Group.\n\nSo how has Campus Corner survived this long?\n\n\"Campus Corner is the perfect example of retail adapting and growing organically over time,\" said Jim Parrack, Price Edwards' senior vice president. \"It's had varied ownership and tenants through the years and its fortunes have ebbed and flowed with the university and the economy from the Harold’s store that we all remember to the dive bars that would come and go.\"\n\nCampus is party central in Norman on game days. Asked for memories, one OU grad cracked, \"I’m not sure any of my stories are printable.\" Another one quipped, \"My stories can't be published.\"\n\nOthers were happy to spill, like Casey Friedman, who was in a band, the Jimmy Dale & the Diamondback Trio, formerly The Poison Okies.\n\n\"May ‘98 I was in a rockabilly band playing at the Deli,\" said Friedman, who is still in a band with his wife, Casey & Minna. \"We always had a great crowd, except one night the venue was empty. I asked the bartender where everyone was. He pointed to the TV: the final episode of 'Seinfeld.' Soon as the show ended, the bar filled with patrons and we played.\"\n\nFriedman's memories are intergenerational: \"I have very fond memories of eating Pizza with my Grandfather at Hole in the Wall Pizza on Campus Corner on game days in the early '90s.\"\n\nTanner Blair, a 2014 OU graduate, lives in Austin now and was happy to think back.\n\n\"One of my favorites is taking an amp to Campus Joe for repairs late at night one time, and him telling me he would fix it for a bowl of chili from Wendy's,\" Blair said. \"Another favorite is when a bunch of us that worked at the Earth (Cafe & Deli) organized an Earth Day bike-in where we took up every parking spot on Campus Corner with a bicycle. People were losing their minds!\"\n\nTiffany Lea was a student from 2008 to 2013, then worked for the university until last year. She thought mostly of places to grab a bite.\n\n\"So many great memories. First night at the dorms walking over to Pita Pit for dinner. Cafe Plaid for lunch most days,\" she said. \"Loved the scones and vegan chocolate chip cookies at Crimson & Whipped Cream. Crooked Crust was a fast fave, too.\"\n\nErin Yarbrough, 2005 grad, said: \"I would pay all the monies for Cafe Plaid tortellini salad and free focaccia bread.\"\n\nParrack said it's not just students and the Sooner faithful who have kept Campus Corner booming lately.\n\n\"The last 10 years have been good to retail in general and to Campus Corner in particular as it's stayed nearly fully occupied with restaurants and retailers that have thrived. A stable group of owners along with a growing Norman economy and university have put it in a great position to be successful,\" he said.\n\nAs for the broader Norman retail market, which Price Edwards combines with Moore, it saw \"modest improvement over the first half of the year with vacancy at 8.3%, down from 8.8 in our year-end report,\" the firm said.\n\n74-year-old Mayfair Village survived, then thrived after COVID-19 challenges\n\nMayfair Shopping Center, as it was first called, helped establish suburban Oklahoma City retail. Developer C.B. Warr, namesake of Warr Acres, started Mayfair in 1948, working with his son, Gene, who finished it in 1958 after his father died.\n\nThe shopping center survived a massive fire in 1971, and Gene Warr operated Mayfair, including the 1989 renovation and rebranding that gave it a Cape Cod look and new name, Mayfair Village, until he retired in 2001. Gene Warr's son, Kory, then took over the family business, which included the shopping center until the Warrs sold it in 2006.\n\nNow, Mayfair Village Shopping Center's 82,642 square feet of space flanking May Avenue south of NW 50, anchored by Michael's and Aldi, is being transformed by owners Nick Preftakes, the Estate of Mark Ruffin, and Caleb Hill. Mayfair was 7.55% vacant at midyear, Price Edwards said.\n\nIt would seem to be a remarkable achievement for the owners. They closed on the investment purchase on March 12, 2020, the day after the never-played Thunder game that brought broad awareness of COVID-19 to Oklahoma City courtesy of an infected Utah Jazz player, triggering shutdowns across business and society in general.\n\nMayfair Village weathered the coronavirus storm. Ruffin, sadly, did not. He died of it nearly a year after the purchase.\n\nSo how has Mayfair Village lasted this long?\n\n\"May Avenue was the original retail corridor for Oklahoma City and Mayfair Village anchored the south end of the corridor,\" Parrack said. \"Although the adjacent neighborhoods have changed through the years, there have been two constants – good traffic and lots of houses nearby.\n\n\"Three owners ago the Warr family remodeled the center into the ‘village’ design most of us are familiar with,\" Parrack said. \"Current ownership is re-imaging the center with a more modern look, more pad sites and an upgraded group of tenants, continuing its long-standing position in our city’s retail history.\"\n\nDespite the timing of the purchase, retail surprisingly recovered, then thrived even with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hill said Mayfair's makeover, thanks to Clyde Riggs Construction, the subcontractors, and Bockus Payne Architecture, should be complete by early next year.\n\n\"Purchasing this property the day COVID lockdowns began has created a lot of unforeseen obstacles, but we are slowly overcoming those obstacles,\" Hill said. \"UPS Store, AM Nails, Mayfair Barber Shop, and Lamees Tailor have all been relocated into new spaces. The new spaces look great and business has been good.\"\n\nHill said the building at 4711 N May, now home to now home to Summer Moon Coffee, Lamees Tailor, Mayfair Barber Shop, and soon-to-open Empire Slice House, is his \"favorite discovery\" at Mayfair.\n\n\"A mid-century modern structure which had been covered in a plywood mansard roof is now back to its original design. Floor-to-ceiling glass, in-ground and neon red stripe lighting, and a large patio creates a lot of architectural excitement. This building has been fun to uncover and redevelop,\" he said.\n\nStein Mart, however didn't make it. The chain had a store at Mayfair from 1991 until 2020, when it filed for bankruptcy in response to the pandemic, closing its bricks-and-mortar stores. It saddened longtime customer Karen Johnston, who said she shopped the Mayfair store for herself and her husband, David, for 25 years until he died in 2015.\n\n\"When they closed down, there was this heartsick feeling that hit the bottom of my stomach,\" said Johnston. \"I wasn't even aware they were shutting down. I knew the women — for years — who worked there. They were distant friends. We like to shop the places that make us feel welcome and comfortable.\"\n\nOther changes: Touchstone Imaging has started construction at 4901 N May with space to let; the former Stein Mart building will yield to construction of new restaurants; and Domino Express is under construction at the site of a demolished gas station, Hill said.\n\n\"A lot of moving parts, but overall we are happy with the progress and reception received from the neighborhoods and community,\" Hill said. \"Their support is why Mayfair continues to be a special place.\"\n\nAs for the broader northwest Oklahoma City submarket as defined by Price Edwards, vacancy was nearly flat at midyear, at 12.2%, compared with 12.3% at year-end, the firm said.\n\nNortheast OKC's Park Estates: Completed in 1951 and still essential\n\nPark Estates was built at midcentury by developer A.G. Meyers to a design by architecture-engineering firm Hudgins Thompson & Ball, designer of Founders Tower, among other city structures. It is near a neighborhood Meyers was also developing, according to the late Lynne Rostichil's 2017 book, \"Oklahoma City's Mid-Century Modern Architecture.\"\n\n\"Completed in 1951, the Park Estates Shopping Center served both the neighborhood and visitors to nearby Springlake Amusement Park,\" Rostichil wrote. \"Park Estates is one of the few vintage shopping centers to maintain its original design.\"\n\nHow has Park Estates lasted this long?\n\n\"Park Estates history has very much followed the history of northeast Oklahoma City,\" Parrack said. \"The intersection of 36th and Kelley became a retail hub for the area with two other neighborhood centers being built adjacent to Park Estates.\n\n\"Though the years when the area began to lose population and make it harder on retailers, Park Estates was able to survive by accepting non-traditional tenants, like churches and service providers, and by offering affordable rents,\" Parrack said.\n\nJohnston, who shopped Stein Mart at Mayfair Village until it closed, remembered Park Estates' heyday in the 1950s.\n\n\"We lived two miles away from Park Estates Shopping Center. My sister and I were 11 years old and 8 years old,\" Johnston said. \"We saved our allowance, from doing our chores, so we could buy our mother a TG&Y glass pitcher and six iced tea glasses for her birthday. She had it until she passed in 1992! Great memory!\"\n\nAt $4.50 per square foot per year, Park Estates' rental rate is currently among the lowest in Oklahoma City.\n\nPark Estate's Shopping Center's 38,000 square feet of space at 1027 NE 36 at N Kelley Avenue, anchored by Beauty Town, marketed by owner Usman Rashid and his Checkers Investments, was 21.05% vacant at midyear, according to Price Edwards.\n\n\"We all love new shiny retail buildings, but all types and price ranges of shopping centers are needed to meet market demand,\" Parrack said. \"Older centers and even some that would be considered run-down allow inexperienced and undercapitalized tenants a place to incubate their businesses, but also allow discount concepts to provide affordable products that wouldn’t be able to operate at higher-priced centers.\"\n\nPark Estates is in good company in the broader west-central submarket as defined by Price Edwards, but most of the retail action is more west than central.\n\n\"The West-Central submarket has been one of the best performing retail areas for several years now with a mid-year vacancy of 5%, down from 6.5 last year. The newer centers in the market, Westgate Marketplace, Yukon Village, The Market at Czech Hall, and West End Pointe and the OKC Shoppes are doing well and staying well-occupied,\" the firm reported.\n\nAdditional notes regarding Oklahoma City's retail real estate market\n\nThe Price Edwards report provides a regular glimpse the good, bad and ugly trends in retail leasing, and detailed information about each of about 270 retail centers larger than 25,000 square feet, totaling 31 million square feet of space, plus another 17.1 million square feet in freestanding stores in the Oklahoma City metro area.\n\nThe twice-a-year report on how retail property is used, to what extent, and by whom gives on-the-ground context for where people shop, dine out and find entertainment. The statistics show what parts of the metro area are most popular for different kinds of consumer spending, and can indicate where the local consumer economy is strongest and weakest.\n\nHere are some highlights.\n\nThe good\n\n\"As expected, the overall retail market continued to do well through the first half of the year,\" according to the report, compiled by Jim Parrack, senior vice president, and brokers George Williams, Ev Ernst, Rosha Wood, Aaron Diehl, Jacob Simon and Allison Bailey. \"Overall market vacancy declined to 9.2% from 10.1 at the end of last year.\n\n\"The improvement was fairly broad across all submarkets and retailers. At this point, the economy is fully open and virtually all retail sectors have recovered from the pandemic.\"\n\nThe bad\n\n\"Americans are flush with money, nearly $4 trillion more than the first quarter of 2020 ... and you’d expect continued market strength,\" Price Edwards said. \"But consumer confidence has been suffering and we all know why — inflation is over 8%, most economists assume we’ll have a recession in 2023, and there’s plenty of local, national and international political turmoil to go around.\"\n\nOn the other hand, \"You would expect these issues to begin hurting our market, but we haven’t seen it yet in the numbers. In fact, our market, our economy, is better than it seems like it should be.\"\n\nThe ugly\n\nIt's the seven shopping centers on the list that are more than half empty. Such high vacancies could be from the loss of one big store, mismanagement, or functional obsolescence, which is real estate speak for outdated, no longer useful, or out of step with the surrounding market.\n\nThe future? Uncertain, but retail development put on pause because of the pandemic is picking up again.\n\nRose Creek Plaza, for example, a \"mixed-use lifestyle development\" to be anchored by a Homeland Food Store, just broke ground at the northwest corner of NW 164 and N May Avenue, adjacent to the Rose Creek Golf Course and Rose Creek neighborhood. It will have 220,000 square feet of space for lease across 27 acres.\n\nRose Creek Plaza will attract a local and national \"array of upscale retail, dining, services and entertainment,\" said Steven Callendar, COO of the local developer, Skybridge Development.\n\n“The lifestyle complex will merge luxury, leisure and convenience, appealing to visitors and residents alike. After years of planning, we’re thrilled to watch it come together,” Callendar said.\n\nSenior Business Writer Richard Mize has covered housing, construction, commercial real estate and related topics for the newspaper and Oklahoman.com since 1999.

It marks a return to Epping after Lexie’s closed its location at the Seacoast United soccer facility in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCargill said they are excited to be back in town with a location near the Epping schools and downtown area. It’s a section of town he described as “the back side of 125,” not so much near the commercial area but closer to “the locals of Epping.” They expect to serve plenty of families with kids getting out of class just around the corner.\n\n“We are excited to be so close to the heartbeat of Epping,” Cargill said. “I think we’re going to generate a lot of buzz.”\n\nIn 2018, Lexie’s partnered with Seacoast United to open an eatery there, serving not just burgers but other items for families watching their children play at the sports facilities. Cargill said that went well until the COVID-19 pandemic caused the sports facility to temporarily curtail operations, which led them to close.\n\nMore:Nick's Place brings roast beef, pizza and more from North Shore to Hampton Falls\n\nTucker Plimpton, a partner with Cargill and his wife Alexis Wile-Cargill, said Lexie’s has wanted to return to Epping. Recently they were driving to a food truck event when they drove through Epping and saw the \"for rent\" sign in the window. With the market for space being competitive, he said, they needed to act fast. They immediately called the number and met with the landlord, who said he was happy to rent to them.\n\n“We always really liked the idea of being in Epping,” Plimpton said. ‘We ended up kind of snatching (the space) up.”\n\nLexie’s brand still growing: Where will it go next?\n\nCargill said he is amazed at the growth Lexie’s has seen since the first location opened. Lexie’s got its start 12 years ago at 212 Islington St. in Portsmouth, named Lexie’s Joint. Cargill and his wife met working at Rockfish in Newburyport, Massachusetts. They wanted to open a place that was affordable but had quality ingredients and inventive burgers.\n\nBy 2016, they had opened Lexie’s in Newburyport, as well as Durham and Exeter, along with their Burger Bus. They’ve since closed in Durham, but have opened a new location in Dover, as well as a seasonal location in Newington called Lexie’s Landing. They also have more than 100 employees.\n\nCargill recalls having just three employees and a baby when they opened their first location.\n\n“We were at each other’s throats. We were trying to build the brand. I was working a thousand hours. No one knew us in Portsmouth,” Cargill said. “We kind of just let the food do the talking, and it’s been such a pleasure to see us grow.”\n\nCargill said Lexie’s has always prided itself on its price in a time when a meal can easily cost a family more than $100 to dine out. He said they do what they can to keep prices down even as inflation brings rising prices to a number of supply lines in the restaurant industry.\n\nExeter:10 big developments — including housing and retail — that will change the face of Exeter\n\n“We try to keep things reasonable,” Cargill said. “You can still go in there, still get a prime meat beef burger for six dollars. You can’t really beat that.”\n\nPlimpton only recently became partner but has been working with Lexie’s since 2017. He said his goal now is to push the Lexie’s brand even beyond its current Seacoast foothold, possibly to the Manchester area.\n\nCargill said Plimpton has been a welcome addition to the Lexie’s family. Cargill, 48, admitted he does not have the energy he did when he started 12 years ago. He said Plimpton is eager to help lead, and he expects that to lead to good things for Lexie’s.\n\n“I don’t know if we’re going to be a Seacoast brand, or move a little west down (Route) 101, or if he’s going to try and go all out and try to go New England,” Cargill said. “I feel like it’s in the right hands with Tucker.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2022/11/01/new-delaware-restaurants-tea-room-fondue-spot-24-hour-diners/69546590007/", "title": "New Delaware restaurants: Tea room, fondue spot, 24-hour diners ...", "text": "Be on look out for new 24-hour diners\n\nFondue options are about to increase\n\nBundt cakes and hot pot are also coming soon\n\nThe Delaware dining scene continues to heat up with more new places to eat.\n\nNew arrivals include two 24-hour diners, a shop specializing in Bundt cakes, a place to indulge in melted cheese and chocolate, and the return of an old family-favorite restaurant.\n\nHere's what has opened and what's coming soon to the First State:\n\nThe restaurant once known as the Marsh Road Diner is under new management, with a new name and new hours.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThe Penny Hill business was rebranded in early September and is now called the Wilmington Diner.\n\nIt also is now open 24 hours, making it one of the few restaurants in the state, besides several Waffle House locations, to keep its doors open continuously.\n\nThe large menu includes diner classics such as scrambled eggs, omelets, Greek and chicken salads, daily soups and club sandwiches.

It drifted through Canada before entering U.S. airspace in Idaho and continuing eastward.At 11 miles above ground, it flew high enough to avoid interfering with commercial air traffic, defense officials said.\n\nIt was finally shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Feb. 4 by a missile fired from an F-22, the military's most sophisticated warplane. President Biden first gave the order to shoot it out of the sky three days earlier while the balloon was above land, but Pentagon officials feared the debris could endanger people on the ground.\n\nThe balloon triggered a diplomatic rift with China that prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned trip to Beijing. The balloon had passed over some sensitive military sites, including facilities holding nuclear weapons and missiles in Montana, according to the State Department. U-2 spy planes sent to examine the balloon in mid-air found that it was equipped with devices to collect \"signals intelligence,\" officials said.\n\nChina denied that the balloon had espionage capabilities, calling it a \"civilian airship\" that had been blown off course over the U.S. while conducting weather research, and apologized for its \"unintentional entry\" into U.S. airspace.\n\nThe military launched a major operation led by the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group 2 to collect the balloon from the water after it was downed. Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck said the balloon was 200 feet tall and weighed around 2,000 pounds – the size of around three buses.\n\nMilitary officials revealed that the Pentagon was aware that suspected Chinese spy balloons had entered U.S. airspace three times during the Trump administration and once afterwards.\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

The Pentagon, after an extensive probe, found no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology on Earth.\n\nIn a conclusion sure to rile conspiracy theorists everywhere, the Pentagon review found there is no reason to believe the U.S. government is hiding information about extraterrestrial visits.\n\nThe findings, sent to Congress as part of a mandated review, are the most extensive rebuttal that the Department of Defense has issued in response to claims that it is covering up alien visits to Earth.\n\nAs with practically everything else originating from the U.S. military, the new report has a wonky name and comes from a wonky office. It’s called the “Report on the Historical Record of U.S. Government Involvement with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Volume I,” and comes from the Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, dated February 2024.\n\nBut the report is a very serious effort, based on an exhaustive all-source review, to put to rest the notion that the Pentagon − or anyone else in or working for the U.S. government − is hiding anything when it comes to visits from outer space.\n\nNope, aliens were not found in Florida:Extraterrestrial life in Miami? No, police say viral video shows human being | Fact check\n\n“To date, AARO has found no verifiable evidence for claims that the U.S. government and private companies have access to or have been reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology,” Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement accompanying the report. “Also, AARO has found no evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.”\n\n“All investigative efforts, at all levels of classification, concluded that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of misidentification,” Ryder added, while also emphasizing that military and civilian authorities will continue to investigate all of the many claims about alien visits.\n\n“As AARO has said before,” Ryder said, “they will follow the evidence where it leads, wherever it leads.”\n\nSpy planes, balloons, and other anomalies\n\nThe 63-page report looked into all information available, and was designed to take into account a broad array of potential anomalies generated by new − and old − technologies. That includes spy planes and balloons used by friendly and hostile nations, military and civilian drones and satellites and even more recreational types of airborne vehicles.\n\nThe report, as exhaustive and conclusive as the Pentagon says it is, is unlikely to quell all suspicions that it is hiding something about the existence of UAPs, its authors acknowledged.\n\nThey cited the increasing attention paid to aliens and UFOS, and widespread distrust of the government.\n\nLast July 26, Congress held a hearing on the issue of UAPs, where lawmakers and a large crowd of spectators listened as a former Air Force intelligence officer testified that the U.S. government is concealing a longstanding program that retrieves and reverse engineers unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe Pentagon has denied the claims made by retired Maj. David Grusch. But his testimony before the House Oversight subcommittee made international headlines.\n\nAccording to an AP report on the hearing, Grusch testified that he was asked in 2019 by the head of a government task force on UAPs to identify all highly classified programs relating to UAPs. At the time, Grusch said, he was detailed to the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency that operates U.S. spy satellites.\n\n“I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program to which I was denied access,” Grusch told lawmakers. He also said the U.S. government likely has been aware of “non-human” extraterrestrial activity since the 1930s.\n\nThe report released Friday did not mention Grusch by name. But it said that in completing it, the AARO “reviewed all official USG (U.S. government) investigatory efforts since 1945, researched classified and unclassified archives, conducted approximately 30 interviews, and partnered with Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) officials responsible for controlled and special access program oversight, respectively.”\n\nThe Pentagon also said the AARO will publish a Volume II − also in accordance with its mandate under the National Defense Authorization Act − that will provide analysis of any information acquired by AARO after the date of the publication of Volume I.\n\nReport unlikely to satisfy everyone: Pentagon\n\nThe report’s findings are unlikely to satisfy everyone, especially those in the community of conspiracy theorists and other independent investigators who think any denials are part of the cover-up, the report’s authors acknowledge. Some are insistent, for instance, that the government has a secret site where it is exploiting downed extraterrestrial craft, which it says it investigated and came up empty.\n\n“A consistent theme in popular culture involves a particularly persistent narrative that the USG (U.S. government) – or a secretive organization within it – recovered several off-world spacecraft and extraterrestrial biological remains … and that it has conspired since the 1940s to keep this effort hidden from the United States Congress and the American public,” the report stated.\n\nBut to drive home its findings, it included details of past investigations, beginning with Project Saucer in 1946 and Projects Sign, Grudge, Twinkle, Bear and Blue Book over the decades that followed.\n\nAn 'obsession' with UFOs dating back more than half a century\n\nAmerica’s “obsession” with UFOs began in 1947, “when two headline-making sightings of strange flying objects prompt the U.S. Air Force’s newly formed Department of Defense to create a series of secret programs to determine how unidentified phenomena may pose a threat to national security,” according to a new – and apparently perfectly timed – book on the topic by journalist and historian Garrett Graff.\n\n“Over the next half-century, as the atomic age gives way to the space race and the Cold War, the mission continues, bringing together an unexpected group of astronomers, military officials, civilian contactees, and true believers who bring us closer, then further, then closer again, to answering one of our most enduring questions: What exactly is out there?” Graff writes in the book “UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government's Search for Alien Life Here – and Out There.”\n\nGraff was unavailable for immediate comment. But X, formerly known as Twitter, was already aflame with hot takes from people who questioned the new Pentagon report’s findings.\n\n“So the people doing the cover up of #ufo #uap say they find no cover up classic self-fulfilled prophesy,” said Tim Burchett, who described himself as a former Tennessee state legislator representing the state’s 2nd district.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/16/trump-biden-drones-nj-latest/77024911007/", "title": "Trump weighs in on drones, claims US government, Biden know ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said U.S. government officials, including President Joe Biden, know where the mysterious drone sightings along the East Coast are coming and going from, accusing the leaders without evidence of intentionally keeping those details from the public.\n\nTrump said the U.S. military also knows where the drones took off and where they went afterward. \"And for some reason, they don't want to comment,\" he said Monday at a wide-ranging news conference at his private club Mar-a-Lago. \"And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.

The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all. Kirby said that there are more than one million lawfully-registered drones in the U.S., thousands of which are flying around on any given day.\n\n\"We have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast,\" he said Monday, crediting law enforcement officials.\n\nAt his press conference, the president-elect said he was reconsidering visiting his Bedminster, New Jersey, club as a result of the nearby sightings. \"I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster,\" Trump said from his Florida club with a smile. \"I've decided to cancel my trip.\"\n\nTrump declined to say whether he'd received an intelligence briefing on the sightings, and it was not clear from his remarks if he had direct knowledge of the origins of the strange lights in the sky, which have been spotted in New Jersey and New York.\n\nHe previously said in a social media post that he did not think drones could be flying over the U.S. without the federal government's knowledge. He said the Biden administration should tell the public more information or \"shoot them down.\"\n\nThe lights in the sky were first spotted in New Jersey in November. The sightings have continued for nearly a month, prompting concern from elected officials. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called on Congress on Saturday to enact stricter drone oversight. The Biden administration had previously asked Congress to take action.\n\nKirby said last week that despite using \"sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities,\" that neither federal nor local officials had not been able to \"corroborate any of the reported visual sightings.\"\n\nU.S. officials have repeatedly said since they do not have any evidence to suggest the drones are being operated by a foreign government or present a danger to Americans.\n\nThe Department of Defense told reporters on a Saturday call that the U.S. does not have intelligence or observations that would suggest any drones that have flown over military bases recently are associated with a foreign power. However, the department said it can not be certain, partly because personnel have to coordinate with local and federal officials to track them down.\n\n\"It is our job to be vigilant,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Sunday on ABC News. \"If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity we will communicate with the American public accordingly.

The Gadsden Times reports Black Creek was restocked Tuesday with about 1,100 pounds of trout above Noccalula Falls by the Rainbow Fly Fishing Club. The group also stocked 1,000 coppernose bluegill into the watershed in late March. Republican Rep. Craig Lipscomb, of Rainbow City, is a member of the fishing club and says its members are working with the city to fill a gap for activities at the falls in the winter months. Lipscomb says trout fishing in Georgia brings in tens of millions of dollars for the state, and Gadsden would benefit even from a fraction of that.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new FBI report says the state has the nation’s highest rate of sexual assault, and violent crime has increased. Alaska Public Media reports that the 2018 statistical analysis from the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program says Alaska does not conform to a general national decline in violent crime. The annual report uses statistics from law enforcement agencies to provide an analysis of crime at the national, state and municipal levels. The report says violent crime in Alaska increased by 3% from 2017 to 2018 while falling 3% nationally. It says Alaska saw an 11% increase in the number of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, while nationally there were 2.7% more assaults. The FBI says Alaskans reported four times more sexual assaults than the national rate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An increase of bald eagle breeding areas this year didn’t result in more nestlings in the state. Game and Fish Department officials say there were 71 eagle nestlings during the 2019 breeding season, down from 87 hatched last year. During the department’s annual bald eagle survey, raptor biologists counted a minimum of 74 occupied breeding areas statewide – up from the 69 counted last year. But the number of eggs laid dipped from 102 last year to 97 this year. The number of birds that made their first flight fell to 63 from the 70 recorded in 2018. Arizona’s bald eagle population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted within the state and the species was listed as endangered. There currently are an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Court records show a former lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribing three former state lawmakers will be sentenced this month. Rusty Cranford could face up to 10 years in federal prison for bribing Sen. Jon Woods, Rep. Hank Wilkins and Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Cranford had hoped to increase revenue for the Missouri-based nonprofit Preferred Family HealthCare. Cranford also confessed to embezzling from the nonprofit where he worked. His attorney declined to comment. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports court records posted Tuesday show he’ll be sentenced Nov. 25. A federal grand jury in Missouri indicted Cranford on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of accepting bribes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: A Northern California brewery owner upset with devastating fires sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric power lines is producing a beer he named “F--- PG&E,” and the brew has sparked a backlash. Steve Doty, owner of Shady Oak brewery in Santa Rosa, announced the new beer last week on a Facebook post. Doty tells SFGate he meant to draw attention to the negligence of PG&E executives and was stunned by the onslaught of critical comments by people who said they are related to utility employees. Others have attacked Shady Oak by giving it one-star reviews on Yelp and Google or calling the taproom with violent threats. Doty posted an apology to those upset by the beer name but says he is still standing by the name.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after an arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game. Gazella Bensreiti said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office Nov. 5. Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care. After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside. The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident. Arena owner Kroenke Sports & Entertainment called the encounter a misunderstanding and said the guard didn’t recognize that Bensreiti was wearing a hijab.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Republicans in the state Senate are unveiling an alternative transportation plan they say doesn’t rely on tolls or tax increases. Thursday’s plan from the minority party in Connecticut’s Senate comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont pitched his 10-year, $21.3 billion initiative to Senate Democrats. While the Democrats liked projects in Lamont’s proposal, they didn’t like how it includes 14 tolls on bridges across the state. It’s unclear whether the GOP’s plan will ultimately lay the groundwork for a compromise on an issue that has vexed the state for years. Like Lamont’s plan, the 10-year, nearly $18 billion Senate Republican plan also relies on low-cost borrowing from the federal government. Instead of using toll money to pay off the loans, it banks on money from the state’s dedicated transportation fund.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s birding community is mourning the loss of Wilmington resident William “Bill” Stewart Jr., who died Tuesday after battling cancer, while celebrating his legacy of conservation and determination. Stewart, 67, was a well-known birder, conservationist, educator and former gymnastics coach who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to permanently preserve nearly 2,000 acres of land for future generations of birders and Delawareans through the Delaware Bird-A-Thon program he started in 2006. He helped put the First State on the birding map by showing visitors and locals the state’s beauty and international role in shorebird migrations. The Bird-A-Thon effort has raised more than $400,000, which has helped protect properties and start a hawk watch program in northern Delaware, as well as a science education grant for researchers. A celebration of life for Stewart will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at the Delaware Nature Society’s Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A landlord in the district is being forced to pay $1.1 million in rent payments to former residents who homes were plagued by pests, mold and raw sewage and violated housing and fire codes. The Washington Post reports D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that Sanford Capital LLC will pay the settlement to 155 former residents “forced to live in squalor.” Racine’s office had sued the Bethesda, Maryland-based company for violating consumer protection laws. For years, tenants struggled with unsanitary and poor conditions that left many without heat in winter months. Prosecutors said some residents also lacked working toilets, stoves or refrigerators. They say Sanford refused to fix some broken locks and didn’t maintain fire extinguishers, a move made even more dangerous by missing or broken smoke detectors.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s light and bright in all the merriest of ways at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom this holiday season. For the first time since the park opened in 1998, there’ll be holiday-themed entertainment and decor throughout the 500-acre park, with twinklers lining rooftops and other new seasonal touches at the park, now Central Florida’s second most popular theme park, behind Magic Kingdom. At DinoLand, Donald’s Dino-Bash, the dance party is complemented by holiday decorations chosen by Donald Duck’s pals, with all kinds of holiday merch available for sale at the gift shop. Diwali, India’s festival of lights, is celebrated over in Asia, while in Africa, African celebrations blend with Western traditions, making a stroll through Harame for food and shopping a colorful mix of tastes and treats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock downtown ahead of a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park. The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000. CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone, not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it. The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely. The Democratic debate will be Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man was surfing with his girlfriend when – instead of hanging 10 – he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reports Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment. Luckily, he had a spare. Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Brigham Young University-Idaho has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage, forcing full-time students to buy a university-backed plan. University officials say health plans could be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family. Officials say a student form used to opt out of the school health plan was updated this month reflecting the change in policy. Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1. State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state. Students say a reason for the change has not been disclosed. Some students argue the plan is expensive and has limited coverage. The university declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A copy of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address that was handwritten by the 16th president himself is going on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum for two weeks. In a news release, the museum says it will display the copy – one of only five surviving copies written by Lincoln – from Thursday through Dec. 2. The display coincides with the anniversary of Lincoln’s delivery of the brief speech Nov. 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. The document that stays in a climate-controlled space most of the time to protect it from light and humidity will be housed in the museum’s Treasures Gallery. The address that begins famously with the words: “Four score and seven years ago … ” is handwritten on plain white paper.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb isn’t promising any quick action on the call for further boosting teacher pay that thousands of educators will be making at the Statehouse next week. Teacher unions say at least 107 school districts with more than 40% of Indiana’s students will be closed Tuesday while their teachers attend the rally. Holcomb didn’t criticize school districts for closing the day of the union-organized rally, saying it was a local decision. The Republican governor said Thursday that he applauds teachers for expressing their concerns, but he’s waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed to make recommendations by the end of next year. The rally dubbed “Red for Ed Action Day” will happen on the day legislators are gathering for organization meetings ahead of their 2020 session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse has a new home downtown. The haunted attraction, which has become a staple in Iowa, has begun moving to the old Bank of America building. To break in the new digs, set to open fully next September, Slaughterhouse will host a Krampus Krawl. The event will begin Dec. 7 with an all-age photo op before the crawl to four Full Court Press establishments. Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as “half-goat, half-demon” in Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore. During the Christmas season, Krampus punishes children who have misbehaved, as opposed to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved children with gifts. Tickets are available online. General admission tickets include a Glow Stein for one free pour at each of the four Full Court Press stops.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has approved a public financing package worth about $35.5 million to subsidize the creation of a medical school. The Wichita Eagle reports the package approved Tuesday will help create a campus for training osteopathic physicians. Called the Kansas Health Science Center, the new school will be built in the former Finney State Office Building. Once the center of state government in Wichita, the building was abandoned in favor of leasing privately owned office space across the city. Plans also call for three other buildings to be transformed – one into student housing, another into a dining hall and culinary center, and the third into a boutique hotel. The bulk of the money for the development will come from tax abatements.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal court is allowing a man to personalize a license plate with the phrase “IM GOD” after a three-year legal battle over the custom engraving. Court documents show Ben Hart, a self-identified atheist, set out to get the Kentucky plate in 2016. But Hart’s request was denied by the state transportation department on the basis it violated antidiscrimination guidelines. News outlets report similar plates had been approved before, including “TRYGOD” and “NOGOD.” Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved to help Hart challenge the decision. In an opinion Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in Frankfort, the judge ruled that “vanity plates” are private speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state had violated Hart’s rights by denying him the plate.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A legislative auditor says 18 cities, towns and villages may be close to reaching bankruptcy or may have the inability to provide basic services to residents in the future based on the municipalities’ most recent financial information. The Monroe News Star reports Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera compiled a list of “fiscally distressed municipalities” and added it the auditor’s website. The municipalities range from small villages like Epps in northeastern Louisiana to larger towns like Winnsboro in central Louisiana. Purpera says the list is a way to alert the public and officials of the problems so they can be easily addressed. The list includes concerns for each municipality, including incomplete or inaccurate financial information, insufficient utility rates, debt and rural water infrastructure problems.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: The town wants the Navy to protect the clam flats as part of its remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The Harpswell Conservation Commission has argued the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former Navy base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove should be extended. The commission told the environmental coordinator for the closure process that the Navy has an obligation to investigate the impact of the stormwater system. The Times Record reports that an investigation of the pond system had found several heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium that could potentially reach nearby clam flats. Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster, says the Harpswell side of the Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has reached 300 homicides in a year for the fifth year in a row. Detective Donny Moses told WBAL-AM the total reached 300 Thursday morning with the shooting deaths of a man and a woman. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is on track to see one of its most violent years on record. The city recorded 309 homicides last year and 342 the year before. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young addressed the homicide rate at a news conference Wednesday. He said the city is working to reduce the crime rate, and leaders aren’t to blame. Young took over as mayor this spring after Democrat Catherine Pugh resigned amid investigations into her business dealings. He’s running for reelection in 2020 against a dozen challengers, some of whom criticized his comments Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSudbury: The Sky Bar, the multiflavored chocolate bar divided into four sections, is back on the market after a yearlong hiatus. The Boston Globe reports that production of the confection has resumed at a suburban gourmet shop less than a year after the owner bought rights to the brand in an online auction. The Sky Bar made its debut in 1938 but was discontinued last year when the New England Confectionery Co., also known as Necco, went out of business. Louise Mawhinney, owner of Duck Soup in Sudbury, bought the rights to the Sky Bar in January. The candy bar, divided into caramel, vanilla, peanut and fudge sections, is available in the store and online for $1.98. After the holidays, Mawhinney plans to get a wholesale license and ramp up operations.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A museum at a former southern Michigan prison is closing at the end of December. Cell Block 7 in Jackson allows visitors to step into the cells and walk the corridors of what was once the largest walled institution in the world. The museum’s website invites people to “spend some time on the inside” during a self-guided tour. The museum opened five years ago under an agreement between the state of Michigan and the Ella Sharp Museum, also in Jackson. Ella Sharp director Diane Gutenkauf says the costs are too high. Gutenkauf says some artifacts from the prison museum will be available at the Sharp museum, including oral histories of people who worked there or were inmates. The last day at the prison museum will be Dec. 29.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The battle over the name of a popular Minneapolis lake has landed before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justices heard arguments Wednesday on whether the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to change the name of Lake Calhoun to its original Dakota name, Bde Maka Ska. The state Court of Appeals ruled in April that the agency overstepped its authority in January 2018 when it changed the name. It said authority to change the name rested with the Legislature under statutes governing lake and other place names. KARE-TV reports Save Lake Calhoun attorney Erick Kaardal argued the legislature enacted a policy that says lake names that have been used more than 40 years cannot be changed without lawmakers granting additional authority. It could take the court months to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nRolling Fork: The state is naming a stretch of land in the south Delta in honor of the two-term governor who is leaving office in January. Officials gathered Wednesday to dedicate the Phil Bryant Wildlife Management Area. The 18,000-acre site in Warren and Issaquena counties is made up of bayous, cypress sloughs and bottomland hardwoods. Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Director Sam Polles says the area is divided into four tracts that will offer different types of hunting, including group hunts in a primitive setting. The department worked with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to buy the land in 2018 from Anderson-Tully Company. Republican Bryant said during the dedication ceremony that he looks forward to bringing his grandchildren hunting on the land.\n\nMissouri\n\nJackson: A rescued puppy is attracting a lot of attention because of his resemblance to a unicorn. The nearly 10-week-old puppy, named Narwhal, has a tail-like appendage growing from his forehead. Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs. Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it. Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fish hatchery will be locked at night and begin using security cameras after vandals mutilated several fish. The Montana Standard reports the perpetrators killed about 20 rainbow trout, broke windows and tossed items into water channels at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the Oct. 27 vandalism at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facility about 88 miles southeast of Butte. Sheriff Phil Fortner says a witness saw a yellow ATV near the hatchery, but no suspects have been identified. Hatchery Manager Ron Hopper says the fish were cut with garden hoes, ice choppers or other tools. Hopper says that for the previous 80 years, the hatchery was left unlocked for after-hours visitors.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Transportation Department is offering to produce and emplace roadside memorials as a way to keep highways free of roadside safety hazards. The new departmental policy announced Wednesday says each sign will display the name of the person being memorialized and include one of five safety messages: “Please Drive Safely,” “Seat Belts Save Lives,” “Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Don’t Text and Drive” or “Don’t Drive Impaired.” The sign will be placed as near to the accident site as possible. Family members who have placed private memorials alongside state highways are encouraged to contact their local department offices to discuss disposition of the memorials and get information on the state installing new signs. The department’s Jeni Campana says the state-produced signs would be of a familiar design and would pose less of a safety hazard than the irregular appearance of private memorials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elon Musk’s Boring Co. will begin drilling an underground tunnel Friday for the Las Vegas Convention Center’s forthcoming people mover. To officially kick off the tunneling phase of the company’s first commercial project, the boring machine will be turned on 40 feet below ground. The $52.5 million underground people mover will allow convention attendees to travel the expanse of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s 200-acre campus in approximately one minute, according to officials. The transportation system will include three passenger stations that connect the convention center’s 3.2 million-square-foot space with the 1.4 million-square-foot West hall that is now under construction. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials say plans call for the expansion project to be completed by January 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: After facing criticism over its prior annual holiday celebrations, the town is making some tweaks, planning a “Frost Fest” without a tree-lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa. WMUR-TV reports in past years Durham’s held a tree-lighting ceremony. But after some concerns that the event was too focused on Christmas, a working group was formed to make changes, such as not hanging wreaths on light posts. The Frost Fest is billed as a “winter celebration” with a bonfire, cookie decorating, ice sculpting, crafts and activities. Last year, town officials were under fire for denying a menorah to be displayed next to the tree decorated annually at a local park. The officials cited vandalism concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state has drumsticked up a plan to deal with flocks of wild turkeys that are ruffling some feathers in a Jersey Shore neighborhood. And it doesn’t involve them winding up on dinner plates in two weeks. The state Department of Environmental Protection will trap scores of turkeys that have descended on a retirement community in Toms River and relocate them. The move comes as some residents say large flocks of turkeys have invaded the area, pecking at cars – and at some people who venture too close. Others say they give the birds a wide berth and haven’t experienced any problems. Toms River residents who have run a-fowl of the birds include former New York Yankees and Mets baseball player Todd Frazier, whose SUV was covered by turkeys recently.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal and state officials have reached an agreement they say will strengthen their relationship as they work to improve forest conditions in the state. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen signed the so-called shared stewardship agreement during a gathering Thursday in Santa Fe. The agreement has been a work in progress over years and will address issues such as wildfires, drought and invasive species. Officials say the challenges faced by land managers transcend boundaries and affect people beyond the jurisdiction of any single organization, so they have to find new ways of working together and doing business at a greater pace and scale. Under the agreement, the state and national forests plan to evaluate opportunities, threats and alternatives for risk management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It’s an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation’s largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city’s youth. The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years­long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles’ fingerprints. Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday that it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely. The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: An opossum has illegally taken up residence in the ceiling of a Duke University dorm, where students have been complaining about being bitten by fleas. The school’s assistant vice president of student affairs, Joe Gonzalez, told reporters Wednesday that the school has yet to catch the elusive opossum about which students first complained in October. He says the creature has escaped custody partly because it appears to be splitting its time between the Few Quad dorm and somewhere else. Reports of fleas also began to surface last month, prompting the school to put students up in another dorm while they fumigated the place. Gonzalez says the opossum may have brought the fleas, but that’s unconfirmed. Irritated students are questioning why they’re dealing with such conditions at a $78,608-per-year school.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials have given an estimate on how much oil was spilled from a pipeline leak in Williams County last month. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality says an estimated 12,432 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline operated by Hiland Crude about a mile northeast of McGregor on Oct. 17. The department says the oil leaked onto cropland. Department staff have inspected the site and say they will continue to monitor remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A traveling exhibit celebrating the service and heroism of military working dogs and the sacrifices they make during battle is being displayed at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The exhibit titled “Canine Warriors – Courage and Sacrifice, Always Beside You” features wooden sculptures of eight Wounded Warrior Dogs and four Canine War Dogs and is now on display at the museum in Dayton. Ohio craftsman James Mellick designed the exhibit to be symbolic of the wounds suffered by military dogs in battle and to raise awareness of their needs. The exhibit also features art depicting working military dogs from the Air Force Art Program. It will remain at the museum through Jan. 31.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: District attorneys are raising concerns about a proposed new ballot measure aimed at further reducing the state’s prison population. In a statement late Tuesday, Oklahoma District Attorneys Association President Jason Hicks says one problem is that crimes like child trafficking, aggravated assault and battery, and domestic abuse aren’t technically violent crimes under state law. The proposed state question filed Tuesday would prohibit prosecutors from using previous nonviolent felony convictions to enhance prison sentences. Hicks says state prosecutors are still examining the proposal, but there are already elements that would be “detrimental, if not catastrophic, for public safety.” District Attorney Angela Marsee says ignoring past convictions of repeat offenders is “detrimental to our mission.”\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Traditional Christmas feasts featuring Dungeness crab may not be in the cards this year, as officials have delayed the commercial crabbing season due to the small size of the crustaceans. The Mail Tribune reports the season had been set to start Dec. 1 for Oregon’s most lucrative commercial fishery, but now crabbing has been postponed until at least Dec. 16. It’s the sixth straight year the season has been delayed to allow the crabs a chance to fatten up to meet industry standards. Dungeness crabs off the coasts of Washington and California also have low meat levels in their shells, prompting similar delays in those states. Tests planned for late November or early December will determine whether commercial crabbers can start plying the Pacific beginning Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The FBI has begun a corruption investigation into how Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration came to issue permits for construction on a multibillion-dollar pipeline project to carry highly volatile natural gas liquids across the state. FBI agents have interviewed current or former state employees in recent weeks about the Mariner East project and the construction permits, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus of the agents’ questions involves the permitting of the pipeline, whether Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits, and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, those people say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal judge has sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls after they challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said in a ruling Thursday that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. Attorneys for the cities said in a statement that they are pleased the court “found DOJ’s attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Bars throughout downtown in this college town are now signed on to the Angel Shot program, offering patrons a way to request help when they don’t feel safe. The simple order – “one Angel Shot, please” – is meant to be a simple solution to combat sexual violence and assault in the university’s entertainment district. An “Angel Shot” is not an actual drink. It is a code word that signals to a bartender or barback that a customer feels unsafe, typically from a potential perpetrator of sexual violence. From there, the bar’s staff will find that customer safe passage out of the bar and home. The Angel Shot program was implemented in every bar downtown this fall semester by Clemson University Student Government, which partnered with Pickens County Advocacy Center, Clemson City Police Department and Clemson’s Healthy Campus for the initiative.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A man sentenced to 90 years in prison for killing his stepfather has petitioned the court in Minnehaha County to change his name because he wants a fresh start. Thirty-five-year-old Daniel Charles was 14 when he was sent to prison in 2000 for first-degree murder in Meade County. He was accused of putting a rifle to his stepfather’s head and pulling the trigger at a ranch near Opal. He told law enforcement at the time that he didn’t know the gun was loaded. Charles’ petition says he wants to change his name to Rameus Tiberius Aryada to start a new life with an adult identity. The South Dakota Department of Corrections lists Charles’ earliest parole eligibility as March 2045.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public. The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website. Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families. Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries and community groups.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: With help from Nueces County Public Libraries, county Judge Barbara Canales led local students on a “bear hunt” at Oscar O. Ortiz Park on Wednesday evening. Despite the biting cold, Canales gamely led the students down a path to read from “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen. The county unveiled StoryWalk, a new feature at the park in which pages of picture books are displayed in wooden stands along paths so residents can read while they walk. It’s an effort to promote literacy and physical activity, and the county plans to implement StoryWalk at more parks. Canales and the kids read aloud together as the characters braved tall grass, a deep river, a forest and mud along their search for a bear. Canales called out to the students to stomp in big strides, run and tip-toe like the characters to bring the story to life.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Thursday announced his 2020 candidacy for the Republican nomination for the office that he held from 2005 to 2009 before leaving to serve as a U.S. ambassador. Huntsman announced his candidacy in a statement before a scheduled kickoff swing Thursday and Friday to Cedar City and St. George in southern Utah. Incumbent Republican Gov. Gary Herbert is not running for reelection, and Huntsman has said he was considering a run for governor. Huntsman served as U.S. ambassador to China in the Obama administration and as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Trump administration. Other Republicans in the 2020 race include Lt. Gov.

It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in the state. Officials estimate about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land. Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday that the state received 21 applicants for the funds. The finalists include Agrilab Technologies of Enosburg Falls. The governor’s office says the group will use existing phosphorus recovery technologies, composting and drying equipment to create a series of sites for phosphorus processing in Franklin, Addison, Lamoille and Caledonia counties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A task force has been created to come up with ways to help mitigate and prevent evictions in the city. The group will include affordable housing and social justice advocates, youth and family homelessness specialists, public housing residents and property management professionals. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a news release that the group will work with the city’s Eviction Diversion Program, which began last month to provide rental assistance, free legal help, financial counseling and supportive service referrals to residents who are facing eviction. Stoney said the task force will explore steps the city can take to better understand the root causes of evictions. A research group at Princeton University found that Richmond and four other Virginia cities have some of the highest eviction rates in the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A weeklong hearing will help determine whether a small American Indian tribe from the northwest corner of Washington state can once again hunt whales. The Makah Tribe conducted its last legal hunt in 1999, when its crew harpooned a gray whale from a cedar canoe. A U.S. appeals court later revoked permission for the hunts, saying the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The tribe has been trying to obtain the waiver since 2005, a process that has been repeatedly stalled by scientific reviews. The hearing beginning Thursday will focus on whether the tribe meets the requirements for the waiver. Animal rights groups oppose the effort. Whatever the outcome, the matter is likely to end up in federal court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Board of Education will give the public 60 days to comment on a proposal on charter schools, double the normal allotted time. The board put the policy proposal up for comment Thursday. Legislation signed by Gov. Jim Justice authorizes a staggered implementation of public charter schools, limiting the state to three charters until 2023, then three more every three years after that. The legislation was part of a broader education bill that included teacher pay raises. The West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia chapter of the American Federation of Teachers have lambasted the bill, saying it shut out teachers’ voices and violates the state Constitution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is asking the Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee to release $3.7 million a year in funding to pay for programs designed to help homeless people. Evers sent a letter Thursday to the committee cochairs, urging them to make available the funding that has been pending for four months. Evers is seeking action now before winter sets in. He says with cold temperatures and snow across the state already, “my concern has only grown.” The funding would go toward such things as grants to help low-income people with housing costs, help fund emergency shelters and pay for support to help homeless people get into permanent housing. The Assembly passed bills to approve the funding, but they’ve stalled in the Senate.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The National Park Service says snowy weather last month likely cut down on visitors to Yellowstone during October. The agency recorded just over 170,000 visitors during the month, a 22% decrease from October 2018. So far in 2019, the park has hosted over 3.9 million visitors, which is down 2.5% from the same period last year. Yellowstone is entering its winter season, when visits to the park are typically the lowest of the year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/01/jake-wilson-mollie-tibbetts-iowa-missing-collins-vigil-la-porte-brooklyn-evansdale-girls-waterloo-ia/877667002/", "title": "Missing Iowans remembered, families supported at Waterloo vigil", "text": "WATERLOO, Ia. — Elizabeth Collins would have turned 15 this week.\n\nTo celebrate, her family and friends sang a birthday song, ate cake and released lanterns and balloons Tuesday at Angels Park, a community healing project where the abandoned bikes of her and her cousin were found in July 2012. Months after finding the bikes, the bodies of the kidnapped girls were discovered in a wildlife area.\n\nNow, more than six years later, Elizabeth's mother, Heather, feels sick when she sees reports of missing children and young adults. She understands the anxiety their family and friends are experiencing.\n\n\"It's like a club, an unwanted club,\" she said in a shirt displaying the faces of Elizabeth and her cousin, Lyric Cook-Morrissey. \"It's still a nightmare every day that I wake up.\"\n\nStanding at a podium during a vigil Wednesday, with family members of missing people seated behind her, Heather Collins had a message: \"We will bring these kids home.\"\n\nMore than 200 people gathered at the RiverLoop Amphitheatre & Expo Plaza in Waterloo to show support for the families of Mollie Tibbetts, a University of Iowa student who vanished two weeks ago, and Jake Wilson, an autistic teenager who disappeared in April from La Porte City.\n\nTibbetts' cousin Morgan Collum, 27, called the turnout amazing and thanked the crowd for supporting her family. She described the last two weeks as difficult, saying when she looks in the mirror each morning, she thinks to herself, \"How am I going to get through this day?\"\n\nAmanda Goodman, a former KWWL anchor who works as the executive director of Family & Children's Council of Black Hawk County, said for more than 100 days, Jake's family has wondered if he is hurt, hungry or scared.\n\nGoodman said Jake's family needs him home. She pointed at his mother, Megan Neiswonger, and told the crowd: \"That is his mother right there; he is not a statistic.\"\n\nAnd then two weeks ago when Tibbetts vanished, \"it was like a punch in the gut,\" Goodman said. She described the region as shook by the disappearances.\n\n\"Today, we are the shocked neighbor,\" Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart said.\n\nFamily members of 14-year-old Kaiden Douglas Estling, of Maynard, also sat in front of the amphitheater. Estling was killed last month when he was struck on a moped by another vehicle; no one has been arrested in connection with the hit-and-run death.\n\nThe vigil was attended by police chiefs from the area and two state representatives.\n\nWaterloo Police Chief Dan Trelka called on Iowans to be vigilant of their surroundings and to better know their neighbors, telling the crowd: \"There is evil is lurking among us.\" He promised those missing they would not be forgotten.\n\nTrelka also had a message to predators of children: \"We will hunt you down to the ends of the earth.\"\n\nPrevious coverage on the search for Mollie Tibbetts:\n\nDespite concern among some citizens, agents with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation have said there was no evidence to suggest the missing person cases were connected.\n\nState investigators have also said the number of missing juveniles reported in Iowa in recent weeks was in line with historical trends. The vast majority are found or returned home within 24 hours.\n\nAt the vigil, state Rep. Jeff Danielson, a Democrat from Waterloo, suggested upgrading the state’s Amber Alert system, which he called important but limited. While Iowans prides themselves on raising children, “we have to do better,” he said.\n\nTibbetts, 20, disappeared after running on the night of July 18 while dog-sitting at the home of her boyfriend and his brother on the western edge of Brooklyn, a city of about 1,500 residents in east-central Iowa. Her disappearance has gained national attention.\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday, state officials said investigators were continuing to follow up on all new leads they received but declined to comment on specific details. When asked whether it was likely Tibbetts had been abducted, one responded that authorities \"don't know where Mollie's at right now.\"\n\nPrevious coverage on the search for Mollie Tibbetts:\n\nPoweshiek County Sheriff Thomas Kriegel said more than 200 leads had been followed up on that included ground, air and K-9 unit searches. As many as 40 investigators have worked on the case each day, he said.\n\n\"Everybody wants to find Mollie and, at this point, we're doing everything we can to make that happen,\" Kevin Winker, director of investigative operations at the Iowa Department of Public Safety, told reporters. \"Our focus right now is to find Mollie.\"\n\nThere have been few updates on the search for Jake. In an interview before Wednesday's vigil, La Porte City Police Chief Chris Brecher said authorities have received a number of reported sightings of the teenager in other states, none of which turned out to be him.\n\nThose tips have been coming in from states farther than usual since the A&E Network television series \"Live PD\" featured Jake's disappearance in June. The show has since highlighted information about Mollie's case.\n\nPrevious coverage on the search for Jake Wilson:\n\nJake, 5-foot-6 and 135 pounds, was last seen April 7 going for a walk to Wolf Creek, which runs through La Porte City. The outgoing nature-lover left without his glasses and was wearing a brown zip-up hooded sweatshirt, dark pants and cowboy boots.\n\nPolice in the community of about 2,200 people used an array of techniques and machinery to clear the creek, which officials had described as their \"main culprit.\"\n\nMore:Iowa's list of missing people has 300+ names. Here's what we know about them.\n\nThey sent dive teams in the creek; used a helicopter from the Iowa National Guard, hovering above in the hopes of moving objects under the water; they called on the public to raise money for an excavator to pull logs and large trees out of the water.\n\nThe teenager's parents \"still have an optimism that Jake is out there,\" Brecher said. After the vigil, his mother walked with Goodman to a railing near the Cedar River, releasing a white balloon into the sky.\n\nYears later, no one has been arrested in the killings of 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins and 10-year-old Lyric Cook.\n\nMore:Pain of 2 Iowa girls' killings remains, but resolve in Evansdale only grows\n\nWhen the girls disappeared, thousands of volunteers searched for them as people across the country called in tips, claiming to have spotted them. Their bodies were found about 20 miles northeast of Evansdale, a 5,000-person town outside Waterloo, in a remote area of the Seven Bridges Wildlife Area.\n\nHeather Collins brought a map to the vigil that pinpointed where people had been reported missing since mid-July throughout the state. Most were teenagers, and while some were runaways, they were still missed by their families, she said.\n\nDrew Collins, Elizabeth’s father, gave $9,000 raised during an annual bike ride to honor the cousins to the Cedar Valley Crime Stoppers and another $9,000 to Angels Park.\n\n“I don’t want to see this happen to anyone else,” Collins said, adding he believed whoever killed his daughter and niece would “have to answer to God.”\n\n“Amazing Grace” played as those gathered lit candles, some people teared up. Talking about Tibbetts and Jake, Goodman told the group they were “lighting their way home.”\n\nHow to contact law enforcement\n\nAuthorities are asking anyone with information about Mollie Tibbetts to contact the Poweshiek County Sheriff’s Office at 641-623-5679 or tips@poweshiekcosheriff.com.\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information about Jake Wilson to call 319-342-2232. The FBI created a website, www.fbi.gov/laportecityiowa, where people can upload photos or videos taken in La Porte City on the day he went missing.\n\nAnyone with information about the hit-and-run death of Kaiden Douglas Estling has been asked to call the Fayette County Sheriff's Office at 563-422-3234.\n\nEvansdale police have asked anyone with information about the killing of the cousins Elizabeth Collins and Lyric Cook call them at 319-232-6682.\n\nFollow the Des Moines Register on Facebook and Twitter for updates.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/12/10/detroit-mayor-mike-duggan/6460464002/", "title": "How Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's past, history have guided him in ...", "text": "Hundreds of Detroit police were in quarantine and, despite his public comments, Mayor Mike Duggan was worried the city might not have enough cops to work the streets.\n\nSo he did what he does best: He worked the phones.\n\nReaching out to a friend who was a partner in the Chicago office of Skadden Arps, a multinational law firm, Duggan asked if they could put him in touch with Abbott, a medical devices company in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nIt was March 27, a Friday, and Duggan had just read that Abbott received emergency use authorization for a novel coronavirus testing machine that provides results in about 15 minutes.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, at about 10 o’clock on Saturday night, Duggan got a text saying the CEO of Abbott would talk to him.\n\n“I think I did wake him up,” Duggan said months later of his call to outgoing CEO Miles White. “What I said to him was ‘I got 600 cops on quarantine, four-day turnaround on tests isn’t working, I need instant results.”\n\nWith the pandemic raging and ravaging big cities — New York City was averaging 500 cases a day at the time — Abbott had more demand than machines.\n\nNevertheless, at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, March 29, incoming Abbott CEO Robert Ford agreed to send machines to Detroit.\n\n“Mayor Duggan expressed what you would want to hear from every mayor and governor around the country during a health crisis —– a deep commitment to ensuring his city had all the necessary resources to battle this pandemic,” Ford said in a statement sent to the Free Press. “He was especially focused on making sure the city’s health care workers, firefighters and police force could get tested and back to work.”\n\nDuggan said the deal for five machines was done by 2 p.m.\n\nBy April 1, a Wednesday, the machines were here, making Detroit the first city performing rapid tests to help get first responders and bus drivers back to work. The number of city employees in quarantine plummeted.\n\n“That was really the turning point for everything,” Duggan said during an interview with the Free Press in late May, during a brief lull in a summer and fall packed with a pandemic, protests, politics and even a plot to kidnap the governor.\n\nThe call to Abbott labs was not the first time, and would not be the last time, Duggan worked the network of contacts he built up over 25 years in public office and nearly a decade as CEO of a major hospital system to help Detroit cope with the pandemic that has killed 1,622 Detroiters and infected another 20,883, as of Wednesday.\n\nThe crisis has shuttered businesses and schools and changed our lives in ways even experts had not predicted when Duggan held his first coronavirus briefing on March 11. It also shifted attention from some challenges Duggan was facing at the time, including criticism from within city hall for his demolition program and efforts to aid a nonprofit run by a friend, to community activists demanding that the mayor find $600 million to compensate residents whose properties had been overtaxed before Duggan took office.\n\nCritics include Anthony Adams, a lawyer who has worked for Mayor Coleman Young and Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. He said the pandemic has allowed Duggan to shift the focus.\n\n“Pre-COVID, there appeared to be a tremendous movement in opposition to the policies that were being proposed,” Adams said, accusing Duggan of catering to the city’s business class at the expense of its working class.\n\nAdams, who is expected to run against Duggan next year, said Detroiters were mobilizing in opposition to the city policy of shutting off water for customers who did not pay their bills as well as Duggan’s determination that the city could not afford to reimburse overtaxed residents.\n\n“That organic movement was gaining strength, and COVID became a breakpoint because, obviously, public meetings and public discussion was severely limited,” Adams said. “It’s a perfect recipe for government secrecy, because people can’t examine all your decisions. All you can see is a talking head citing facts and figures and appearing to do the right thing … Average Detroiters are still suffering.”\n\nAlexis Wiley, the former Duggan chief of staff who left the administration to work on the mayor’s bid for a third term, said the mayor was made for this moment.\n\n“With his background in health care and running a hospital that was about to go into bankruptcy, this is his sweet spot,” she said. “It’s a blend of politics, finances and science — and there’s no blue print.”\n\n“At his core, this is what he’s for,” Wiley added. “He’s a war-time general.”\n\nWhat isn’t debatable is that Duggan has come a long way from his days coaching fifth grade girls in Livonia.\n\nType A — and then some\n\nDuggan, 62, was in grade school when he worked on his first campaign in 1965.\n\nPatrick Duggan Jr. — his dad — lost that bid for district court judge.\n\n“I was in second grade then, so I don't take responsibility for that one,” Duggan said years later, long after his father had become a federal judge.\n\nBy the time he was 11, Duggan was singing campaign songs at shopping centers with the Mini-Macs, a group of kids his mother organized to support Ed McNamara’s run for mayor of Livonia.\n\n“The shopping center manager would try to throw them out, and Mike would start debating whether he could or not,” McNamara told Corporate Detroit magazine more than 20 years later.\n\nEven as coach of the Roadrunners, Duggan was a master strategist.\n\nGreg Budde, Duggan’s friend since 1972, said he helped Duggan coach the girls’ baseball and softball team in Livonia. The future mayor told the Roadrunners he was going to be general manager of the Detroit Tigers someday. In the meantime, he focused on teaching the girls how to slide, how to run down a deep fly ball — and more.\n\nIf there was a pop-up, Duggan would say: “‘Catch the ball, Ellen!’” Budde recalled. “And we didn’t have a girl named Ellen.”\n\n\"Ellen\" was code for a player to drop the ball to set up a double-play.\n\nSports and politics were a big part of Duggan’s upbringing in the Livonia home where he lived with his four brothers and civic-minded parents. So was debate, which was as big a deal as sports at uber-competitive Detroit Catholic Central High School.\n\nBy 1976, Duggan and Dan Mulhern were among the top high school debaters in the country.\n\nMulhern, who attended University of Detroit Jesuit High School, said he and his partner won just about every tournament they entered that fall, besting Duggan on multiple occasions.\n\nMulhern said he was \"rubbing the sleep out of my eyes and looking around for old friends and cute girls” before a meet early one Saturday morning when Duggan picked him out of the crowd.\n\nWith an “ear-to-ear, confident grin,” Duggan declared: “Mulhern, if we face you today, I’m gonna kick your ass.”\n\nBrash and confident, Duggan aimed to rattle opponents. He and his partner worked hard and were aggressive, even interrupting opponents.\n\n“That was unusual,” Mulhern said. “They were very edgy — Mike was very edgy in that way.”\n\nMulhern and Duggan met again months later, during a competition hosted by the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThere were about 100 teams competing. Duggan only cared about one.\n\n“Mike had prepared an entire round of speeches exclusively for us,” Mulhern recalled. “They had watched the game film, so to speak, and mapped our every move. And they destroyed us.”\n\n“In a world of competitors,” Mulhern said, “Mike was the fiercest in the jungle.”\n\nAdventures in Wayne County\n\nIn 1982, Duggan was a soldier in McNamara’s campaign for Wayne County executive.\n\nMcNamara lost.\n\nIn 1986, Duggan was the general.\n\nMcNamara won.\n\nSo he made the 28-year-old lawyer his top deputy.\n\nOne of Duggan’s early prized recruits was a recent law school grad: Mulhern.\n\n“On my first day of work, he introduced me to Bob Wisler, one of Ed McNamara's longest-serving aides, who, like McNamara, was literally more than twice our age,” Mulhern recalled.\n\nHe said Duggan told Wisler: “‘This is Dan Mulhern, and you're in his office. When are you going to be out of here?’”\n\n“I'm not sure who felt more embarrassed, me or Wisler,” Mulhern said. “He just kind of smirked and shook his head and, in today’s language, said, ‘Whatever, Mike.’\n\n“But he knew he had to go.”\n\nDuggan said recently that Mulhern might not have known that Wisler was being moved to a bigger office as part of a reorganization. He said Wisler is a long-time family friend and knew he was only kidding.\n\nMcNamara’s administration eliminated a $135 million deficit it inherited, improved the county’s bond rating, helped negotiate deals for Comerica Park and Ford Field, launched environmental initiatives and improved or replaced county facilities ranging from the morgue to the juvenile jail to Metro Airport, which added runways and new terminals as part of a $1.6 billion overhaul.\n\nIt was also plagued by questions about contracting and cronyism before a federal public corruption investigation made headlines. In the end, the only people convicted were three little-known political appointees.\n\nDuggan said he had been recruited to work in the county's legal department by John O'Hair, who was doing double duty as corporation counsel and prosecutor when McNamara made Duggan his second-in-command. As one of the most powerful officials in Wayne County, Duggan was seldom far from the action, which ranged from being tasked with saving public transportation to being accused of meddling in the investigation of Malice Green, a Black man who died after a Detroit police officer beat him during a traffic stop in 1992.\n\nThen, as now, Duggan was data-driven, with giant flow charts adorning the walls of his office.\n\n“He’s always been a guy who looks at the numbers to see the trends, and for accountability as well,” said June West, who Duggan hired as marketing director for SMART, the failing suburban bus system.\n\nWest said SMART was three weeks away from being unable to meet payroll when Duggan retooled the system and rallied public support. She said he replaced quarterly directors meetings with weekly meetings, and talked with bus drivers, mechanics and dispatchers to “find out from them how things could be done better.”\n\n“He would work all day, he would leave at whatever time to get home for the kids’ soccer practice … and then he’d come back to work,” West said. “He knows how to fix things — and there are always things that need to be fixed,” she said. “Complacency is not part of his DNA. It’s always about how we can do this better.”\n\nIn 1992, Duggan was essentially working two full-time jobs — deputy county executive by day, general manager of SMART by night — when Green died. Young, Detroit's mayor, said Green was “literally murdered by police.”\n\nThree years later, Kalil Jiraki, a former county pathologist, sued the county, his boss, Duggan and another county official. He said his boss and Duggan tried to make him change his autopsy findings to say that cocaine contributed to Green's death and that, after he refused, they tried to destroy his reputation and fired him.\n\nJiraki’s attorney Mike Stefani told jurors that the medical examiner and Duggan pressured Jiraki to blame Green's death on cocaine to pacify predominantly white suburbanite voters, who felt that the white cops were getting a raw deal.\n\nDuring a deposition, Duggan denied interfering, calling O’Hair: “the closest thing to a mentor I have ever had.\n\n“He is a close friend of my boss,” Duggan added. “The idea that we would at any point try to undercut his prosecution is absurd.”\n\nHe said that if any Wayne County employees had tried to undermine the case against the officers, “I would have fired them myself.”\n\nDuggan said he always supported prosecuting the officers and accused the cops’ supporters of putting out racist literature.\n\n“I find them offensive,” Duggan said. “I think it's a disgusting group.”\n\nA judge dismissed Duggan from the lawsuit, which Jiraki won in 1997. A jury awarded him $2.5 million.\n\nA year later, Duggan helped Mulhern’s wife Jennifer Granholm, who also worked for the county, win the Democratic nomination for attorney general. She became the first woman elected to that post. Four years later, Mulhern became Michigan’s first First Gentleman when voters made Granholm the first woman elected governor.\n\nIn between those campaigns, Duggan put his own name on the ballot, running in 2000 for Wayne County prosecutor.\n\nRedefining the role\n\nIn 2001, Duggan’s first year on the job, prosecutors seized 146 houses in a crackdown on drug dens and derelict landlords.\n\nIn 2000, O’Hair’s last year as the county’s top law enforcement official, the prosecutor’s office seized one house.\n\nThose figures, reported by the Detroit News, captured the new focus and aggressiveness Duggan brought to the job.\n\nEven though he had never handled a criminal case or worked in the prosecutor’s office, Duggan vowed to get more production out of the staff, as well as crack down on gun crime, deadbeats and scofflaws. The Free Press and News had recently published major investigations into the number of people shot by Detroit police. So Duggan announced he would create a new unit to review police shootings.\n\nHe said the reviews would be “very aggressive.”\n\nTrigger-happy cops weren’t the only ones in Duggan’s cross-hairs.\n\nHe needed money to give prosecutors raises, so he increased the fee for Johns to get their cars back after they were stopped for soliciting prostitutes. The cost jumped from $250 to $900, bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars. Duggan said his annual goal was $2 million.\n\nIn March 2003, the prosecutor’s office launched “Johns TV,\" a 15-minute show broadcasting the names and faces of men convicted of soliciting prostitutes. It included warnings about sexually transmitted diseases and encouraged practitioners of the oldest profession to find a new line of work.\n\nDuggan’s crackdown on quality of life crimes included taking a hard line on graffiti. In one case, he pushed for two-month jail sentences for nationally known graffiti artists convicted of misdemeanors for tagging a vacant building without permission.\n\nAnd then, just as his political career was taking off, it was over.\n\nProfit — and problems\n\nFor years, the flow of red ink at the Detroit Medical Center resembled the arterial spray from a machete attack.\n\nThe DMC was one of Detroit’s largest employers, operated one of the region’s best and busiest emergency rooms, and served as a training ground for Wayne State University medical students as well as a crucial source of care for the needy.\n\nGranholm tried to stanch the bleeding with a $50 million state bailout before the hospital turned to Duggan in desperation.\n\nDuggan recently said the money was spent by the time he got the job. Still, the DMC made a small profit in 2004, Duggan’s first year on the job.\n\nBefore long, the political operator who had once eschewed the spotlight became the voice of the DMC, promising in a blitz of radio advertisements to cut wait time at the system’s hospitals to 30 minutes or less. Hospitals throughout the region rushed to match the DMC’s promise.\n\nInstead of closing hospitals, DMC branched out. It made money every year of Duggan’s tenure, raking in $44.7 million in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, for-profit Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems initiated the purchase of the non-profit DMC. Critics worried the sale would undercut the DMC’s community-oriented mission. Duggan said an infusion of cash from a new owner was the only way the system could afford upgrades it needed to compete with rivals building swanky new facilities in the suburbs.\n\nBut before the deal could be completed, DMC officials contacted federal prosecutors to disclose potentially improper financial relationships with more than 250 physicians.\n\nCrain’s Detroit Business reported that the deals occurred between 2004 and 2010 — Duggan’s tenure as CEO — and included “below-market leases with doctors, free advertising, marketing and tickets to sporting events and educational seminars.”\n\n“Many of the violations appear to be related to efforts by Duggan to bring more physician referrals to the DMC,” Crain’s reported, adding that there were also problems with documentation for Medicare and Medicaid billings for physician services from 2007 to 2010.\n\nDMC announced on Dec. 30, 2010 that it would pay the federal government a $30 million settlement. Duggan described the problems as minor “technical violations” and the DMC did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nPeter Caplan, a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, told Crain’s “the $30 million was not a slap on the wrist in any circumstances.”\n\n“It is a substantial amount of money, and it was as much as the government could get from DMC without preventing the deal from closing,” he said, adding: “We also did not want to see the hospital (system) close.”\n\nThe $1.5 billion sale of the Detroit institution to Nashville-based Vanguard closed the next day.\n\nDuggan stayed on, but soon began exploring other options.\n\nIn February 2012, he bought a house in Detroit’s leafy Palmer Woods neighborhood.\n\nIn the fall, Duggan told DMC employees he was cutting his salary and workload as he considered running for mayor of Detroit.\n\nIn, out, write-in\n\nIt’s said that Duggan likes nothing more than a problem.\n\n“He sees a problem and he wants to fix it,” said Craig Fahle, who interviewed Duggan while working at Detroit Public Radio and, later, worked with him after joining the Detroit Land Bank. “For people who like a challenge, you can’t find one much bigger than the city of Detroit.”\n\nBut Duggan couldn't conceive of a solution to the problem he encountered when a judge threw him off the 2013 primary ballot for filing his campaign paper work less than a year after he registered to vote in Detroit.\n\nAfter the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, Duggan said he wouldn’t appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court.\n\nAlmost before it began, his mayoral campaign was over.\n\nBut not for long.\n\nSupporters began talking about a write-in campaign. Soon, Detroit’s corporate leaders began writing big checks to a committee touting Duggan for mayor. Turnaround Detroit raised $1.4 million and launched a pro-Duggan media blitz. That effort, coupled with Duggan’s superior organization and the more than $1 million his campaign raised, helped him finish first in the primary. Duggan beat Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon by 10% in the general election.\n\nDetroit’s new mayor again targeted improving emergency response time and eliminating blight.\n\nPortia Roberson, whom Duggan had recruited to work for him in the prosecutor’s office and, later, at DMC, said the mayor is driven and wants to surround himself with people who are smart and hard workers.\n\nSo he started recruiting, asking businesses to connect him with people who knew how to implement Lean and Six Sigma, which are business programs designed to improve efficiency, reduce waste and maximize customer satisfaction.\n\nBethany Melitz, who started as a member of the Lean team and rose to chief administrative officer before leaving in April, said Duggan meets with as many people as possible.\n\n“He just wanted to hear … what systems would fix their problems,” she said.\n\nBecause public safety is one of his priorities, Duggan has met with gang members in a city park.\n\nMelitz recalled the mayor telling a gang member at one meeting: “I’m trying to reduce crime in the city. I’m trying to understand why it’s happening. What do you guys need from the city in order to be productive members?”\n\n“One of the people said: ‘There’s a house next to me that needs to be demoed,’ ” Melitz said, adding that a couple others said they needed jobs.\n\nShe believes the house got knocked down. And she said the other guys got jobs in the city’s General Services Department.\n\n“He doesn’t assume he knows why people do things,” Melitz said of the mayor. “He always wants to hear it from them … If he wants to know why do people shoot things, then he’s got to talk to the shooters.”\n\nConversations with Duggan’s subordinates from his county days to the present yield similar evaluations: He is often the smartest guy in the room, he loves data, he solicits input but doesn’t tolerate fools, he asks lots of questions, he works hard, he is resourceful, he demands results, and he trusts but verifies.\n\nBrad Dick, Duggan’s Group Executive for Infrastructure, started with the city in 2006. He said he met Duggan when the mayor dropped by a city garage.\n\n“Out of the corner of my eye I saw a guy standing there and I said, ‘What’s that guy doing?’” Dick recalled. “And I said, ‘Can I help you, sir?’ ”\n\nThe man started asking questions.\n\n“And then I said, ‘Ohmigod, you’re the mayor!’”\n\nAnother time, he said, Duggan was emphasizing trash pickup. So the mayor drove around until he found a street with trash cans still on the curb.\n\nDick said Duggan was looking into one of them when a neighbor called out: “Hey, get out of my trash can!”\n\n“There’s no hiding anything from him,” Dick said. “He gets to the bottom of everything. He gets to the root cause.”\n\nFahle said Duggan is demanding, but not unreasonable.\n\n“He always wanted us to be as prepared to answer as many questions as we could,” he said. “And if we didn’t know, he wanted us to get answers the next day.”\n\nRoberson, who worked for Mayor Dave Bing for about 18 months before Duggan succeeded him, said Duggan has high expectations.\n\n“He will say: ‘Nope, you’ve got to get this done. And you’ve got to get this done now.' ”\n\nRoberson and Fahle said Duggan motivates by challenging people to keep up with him. And, if they can’t, that’s too bad — for them.\n\n“He’s not going to be your best chum or anything like that,” Fahle said.\n\n“I don’t think Mike worries too much about what people will say about him,” Roberson said.\n\nBut there are also stories about Duggan taking a personal interest in employees’ medical needs — even making calls and recommending doctors.\n\n“When my dad passed away, he sent me the nicest, kindest text message I’ve ever seen,” Dick said.\n\nMelitz said Duggan allowed her to bring her toddler to cabinet meetings, the weekly sessions where Duggan quizzes his staff and gives marching orders.\n\nMulhern, who debated Duggan in high school and later worked for him at Wayne County, called the mayor a “pacesetter.”\n\n“You know that you were working harder than anybody, but you had to keep up,” Mulhern said. “But don’t expect praise after the first two weeks.”\n\n“It was about the work. It wasn’t about people feeling good.”\n\nIn an interview with the Free Press earlier this year, Duggan said: “I never have to fire anybody. The people who are committed to making this city better oftentimes find they accomplish far more than they thought they could when they’re part of a team like this.”\n\n“We have a saying: ‘I really don’t care about the quality of your excuses.’ ”\n\nMissteps and controversies\n\nDespite his love of data and legendary attention to detail, Duggan's insatiable drive for results has a tendency to get him in trouble.\n\nIn his first term, Duggan’s team got caught fudging numbers on the cost of demolition and had to return millions of dollars in state grants. The state ended up sending the money back to knock down more buildings.\n\nDuggan took the blame for the problems, telling reporters he may have pushed his team so hard that they were more focused on results than rules.\n\nThe demolition program has also been criticized for creating potential environmental hazards for neighbors exposed to the toxins released when a building is razed.\n\nIn October 2019, Detroit Inspector General Ellen Ha concluded that Make Your Date, the nonprofit created to reduce infant mortality run by Duggan’s friend, received preferential treatment because the mayor chose to partner with the program without first going through a competitive selection process.\n\nBased on the evidence gathered, the OIG concludes that the selection of MYD lacked fairness, openness and transparency,” Ha wrote.\n\nIn November 2019, Detroit Auditor General Mark Lockridge blasted the city for having “inconsistent and unreliable” demolition data, as well as poor record keeping that made it difficult to perform the audit.\n\n“A perception that public officials are using the procurement system to reward themselves, their friends, or supporters, poisons the public’s confidence in government and shakes its faith in the bureaucratic process,” Lockridge wrote.\n\nCurrent and former employees said two causes of Duggan’s problems may be that government doesn’t move at the speed of Duggan — and Duggan’s faith in his own judgment.\n\n“Mike belongs to a category of leader that are so focused on achieving results that they are going too quickly and they may make some mistakes, but they have supreme confidence that they can adjust,” Mulhern said. “I think Mike’s confidence gives him the ability to do things and adjust.”\n\nBob Ficano, former Wayne County executive, called Duggan a \"very good administrator,\" but said \"he pushes really hard and really quick and that's where it leads to those issues like the blighted houses.\n\n\"The train got ahead of itself.\"\n\nA federal investigation into Detroit’s demolition program yielded convictions of a low-level Detroit Building Authority official and an employee of a demolition contractor. Federal prosecutors said they did not plan to charge any more Detroit officials.\n\nA Nov. 29, 2018 FBI report the Free Press obtained that was written by the Detroit office’s top public corruption agent says: “Writer advised source, consistently with the advice writer has given the source in the past, that the FBI does not have a pending investigation of Mike Duggan.”\n\nThat source is Robert Carmack, a Detroit businessman who had been little-known outside political circles before 2018, when his property disputes with the city made headlines.\n\nWhile Carmack and the city exchanged lawsuits in state and federal court, Carmack hired private investigators to follow Duggan. That effort yielded video of the mayor driving to a suburban home where he met on several evenings with a woman who was not his wife. Duggan said Carmack was trying to pressure him and declined to comment on the nature of his relationship with the woman, a doctor who ran Make Your Date. Six months later, the Duggans filed for divorce. They released a statement calling it a “painful decision” and vowing: “We will continue to be supportive of each other, of our family and of the citizens of Detroit.”\n\nAn April 25, 2018 FBI report the Free Press obtained revealed that city officials met with a federal prosecutor and FBI agent in early 2018 to discuss their investigation into one of Carmack’s land deals, which the city deemed fraudulent.\n\nBy December, city officials succeeded in convincing local prosecutors to charge Carmack with four felonies, including fraud, for collecting $1 million for the sale of land the city said it owned. Carmack argued that the city gave him the land in return for his investment in an earlier project that fell apart after he refused to give $50,000 to one of Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick’s henchmen.\n\nDefense attorney Mike Rataj, who has consulted with Carmack, said the prosecution was designed to punish Carmack for exposing corruption.\n\n“It’s clear that the city of Detroit does not have standing as an alleged victim in the case,” he said. “They don’t own the property that they claim Carmack stole from them.”\n\nThe first judge to review the evidence said she thought the case was thin, but sent it to trial. Jury selection is expected to start next year. Duggan has said the city is merely trying to defend its rights.\n\nMulhern, who is not familiar with the Carmack dispute, said Duggan is not vindictive, but takes actions that he thinks will yield long-term benefits.\n\n“He would intimidate you or cut you off or run a candidate against you in order to do something in the future,” he said of Duggan’s days in Wayne County government. “It was a future focus, it wasn’t score settling.”\n\nFicano isn't so sure.\n\nWhile serving as sheriff, Ficano battled with the McNamara administration over control of the Wayne County Jail.\n\n\"You definitely want to be his friend, not his enemy,\" Ficano said of Duggan. \"He comes after you with both barrels.\"\n\nFicano, who had faced little competition in previous elections, said McNamara and Duggan recruited a candidate to run against him in 1992. He said his opponent raised about $1 million and nearly knocked him off.\n\n\"If he wants to go after something and you're on his radar screen, life isn't going to be very pleasant for you,\" Ficano said, adding that a truce was quickly negotiated after he survived the challenge.\n\nIn the days after Carmack held a news conference on Nov. 28, 2018 and suggested he had more incriminating video of Duggan, the mayor and Carmack tried privately through an intermediary to negotiate a truce. Duggan later said he was really just trying to collect more evidence against Carmack. A Dec. 17, 2018 FBI report the Free Press obtained said Carmack “does not have additional compromising video of the Mayor of Detroit” and\n\nCarmack was “stringing (Duggan) along” in a bid to help him in one of his lawsuits against the city.\n\nAmidst these public and private distractions, Duggan suffered a rare public setback.\n\nThe generally pliant city council rejected his request to put a $250 million demolition bond on the ballot. The mayor warned that the federal funds the city used to help tear down 17,000 abandoned buildings were nearly gone and, without $250 million, the city could not remove or renovate the city’s remaining blighted houses.\n\nBehind the scenes, Duggan and his team worked with Fiat Chrysler on a plan to assemble land FCA needed to convert an idled engine plant into an assembly plant for a new three-row Jeep.\n\nThe FCA project promised thousands of jobs. It would be the first new auto plant to open in Detroit in more than a quarter century.\n\nThen, on Jan. 9, 2020, the consummate problem solver inherited a new challenge. The Detroit News reported that the city overtaxed homeowners by failing to lower property values in the wake of the Great Recession, when home prices cratered and foreclosures flourished. The newspaper calculated that Detroit owed homeowners $600 million, and had created a tax burden that cost some people their homes.\n\nMuch of the overtaxation occurred before Duggan took office. In his first month on the job, he announced that he would lower property taxes by 5 to 20%. And even though Duggan ordered a reappraisal of every residential property in 2017 to correct the problem, activists demanded that the mayor offer refunds — and even homes — to people who lost their property to foreclosure.\n\nIn February, community activist Nicole Small led a meeting at a downtown union hall calling for action. Flyers handed out had the headlines “Make Us Whole” and “Cut The Damn Check, Mike!” over a photo of a downcast Duggan. On Feb. 28, protesters marched outside city hall and packed a city council meeting.\n\nWhile Duggan acknowledged the over-assessment, he has said the city can't afford to pay back the $600 million and that the deadline to do so has passed. He added that most of those taxes were paid to the school district and other governmental agencies.\n\nSmall said she doesn’t buy it.\n\n“He finds money for everything else,” she said.\n\nAs the property tax refund movement was gaining momentum, a little-known bug was also picking up speed, bearing down on Detroit.\n\nA novel challenge\n\nDetroit Chief Public Health Officer Denise Fair was at a Super Bowl party on Feb. 2, 2020 when she got word to prepare for a flight being diverted to Detroit.\n\nIts point of origin?\n\nWuhan, China.\n\nFair started working for Detroit in September 2019. She said the coronavirus first came up in December. Planning for the pandemic began in early January.\n\nBut the gravity didn’t sink in until after the Super Bowl, when Fair participated in a conference call with local health officials, Michigan Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun, and federal officials.\n\n“That’s when I knew this is really an all-hands-on-deck moment,” Fair said.\n\nShe said Detroit’s first coronavirus case came on March 11 — the same day Duggan held his first news briefing.\n\n“There’s no reason to panic,” the mayor told reporters. “But there’s every reason to be prepared.”\n\nThe city announced several measures to fight the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a new initiative to help Detroiters restore water service.\n\nAdams, who ran the city’s water department under former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, later said the city’s decision to shut off water left poor Detroiters vulnerable to infection.\n\nDuggan also recommended that people who have a fever, cough or shortness of breath — which initially were the leading signs of infection — stay indoors.\n\n“If people who had these symptoms stayed home,” he said, “this outbreak would be brief.”\n\n“This virus will stop spreading when we start being responsible to our neighbors,” Duggan said, adding that city officials were contemplating whether to cancel large public gatherings. The mayor had already urged organizers of the St. Patrick Parade to cancel the 62nd edition of the bacchanal to prevent tens of thousands of revelers from crowding the curbs along Michigan Avenue and packing the bars of Corktown.\n\nOn March 12, Duggan said he supported keeping schools open, did not plan to close recreation centers and was “looking at” whether casinos might pose a risk. After the Utah Jazz announced that two of their players were infected, the mayor declined to name the hotel where they stayed for their March 7 game with the Pistons. He said health officials inspected the hotel and were satisfied it had been sanitized.\n\n“I thought his response was very, very secretive,” Adams said months later. “I found that unusual, because as a former health care executive … you begin contact tracing.”\n\n“I didn’t really feel the empathy there from the mayor,” Adams added. “He kind of played it off as not being a really big deal.”\n\nBy March 13, Duggan’s briefing had taken a dire tone. He announced the closure of recreation centers and assigned their workers to help school officials deliver food to needy families.\n\n“It’s clear we’ve moved to a different stage,” he said. “We need to be completely honest about what we’re facing. … This is not going to be over in a few weeks.”\n\nDuggan said he expected the number of coronavirus cases to “grow dramatically.”\n\n“We’re going to have to find a different way to live,” he said.\n\nMonths later, Duggan told the Free Press he underestimated the coronavirus threat.\n\n“It was something that I’ve already lived through once,” he said, referring to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic that hit in 2009 while he was running the DMC. “It turned out to be something dramatically less than what was predicted, so the early predictions nationally that this wouldn’t be that big in America, I was kind of seeing it through my experience with H1N1 and I wasn’t focused on it being anywhere near what it was.”\n\nNevertheless, since mid-March, the rest of America has been trying to keep up with Detroit.\n\nWhile Michigan — and the rest of the country — struggled to find test kits, Duggan convened local officials and hospital executives to collaborate on plans for a drive-through testing site.\n\n“It was just so stark and so real; it was scary,” said Dick, who was charged with creating the test site at the state fairgrounds. “I looked at Alexis (Wiley) and I said, ‘I feel like we’re in a movie set where things end badly.’ ”\n\nA key to the plan’s success — securing test kits — hinged on a call to JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America.\n\nDuggan heard that BioReference, a New Jersey company, had ramped up its testing capacity. So the mayor reached out to JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has praised Detroit and launched a $100 million investment program here in 2014.\n\n“When the mayor calls and has an urgent need, we try to be helpful,” said Peter Scher, the bank’s head of corporate responsibility.\n\nHe said the bank had heard of BioReference, but didn’t know the company well. Still, they reached out to CEO Phil Frost and told him Detroit was important to JP Morgan “and we had huge confidence in the mayor.”\n\nScher said BioReference was only doing testing for New York and New Jersey, but agreed to speak to Duggan.\n\nA couple hours later, on March 18, a Wednesday, BioReference and Duggan connected. The mayor's father died that day. Duggan said he stepped out of his mom's condo to take the call from BioReference executive chairman Jon Cohen.\n\n“And, by Friday, they had the deal for testing,” Scher said.\n\nDuggan said BioReference initially balked, saying they were swamped with demand from New York and New Jersey. The mayor said sharing the city’s plan for the drive-through testing facility turned the tide. BioReference agreed to process 500 test kits per day.\n\nDuggan later said it took more than his relationship with other executives to close the deal.\n\n“The city of Detroit has a reputation among the corporate and philanthropic community nationally that, if you sign up for something, you’ll be proud of what your partnership with the city produces,” he said.\n\nDetroit’s drive-through testing site opened on March 27 and soon became a model for the nation. As of Wednesday, the city, and its health care partners, had administered 69,567 free coronavirus tests.\n\nOver the next several months, Duggan, whose appreciation for the media’s role in the body politic often seemed like the body’s appreciation for bacteria in the digestive tract, held almost daily news briefings. While he didn’t answer every question, he placed no limits on what reporters could ask.\n\nDuggan announced new initiatives to get personal protective equipment to nursing homes and businesses; financial and legal help for businesses and renters; testing at nursing and group homes, as well as senior citizen housing; new developments and projects; encouraged and praised Detroiters for wearing masks; and threatened businesses that failed to abide by the city’s safety guidelines.\n\nAt the April 27 briefing, the normally guarded Duggan opened up a bit.\n\n\"I know the pain of losing a family member in the midst of this,\" he said, referring to his father's death on March 18 after a long illness.\n\nIn a rare moment of public reflection, the mayor said what haunted him was the question: \"What could we have done sooner?\"\n\nA week later, on May 4, he said: \"Every single person who dies in Detroit, I look at that detail of that loss.\"\n\nThe briefings are broadcast live on the city's Facebook page and cable channels. In the spring, when White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said during a news conference in Washington: “We really want to thank the mayor for making sure everyone is receiving adequate health care and testing,” the city posted that video, too.\n\nAt the May 6 briefing, a day after appearing on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, Duggan said: “I must get a half dozen calls every week to do national TV shows. ... They all want to talk about what’s going on in Detroit.”\n\nDeaths from COVID-19, which had been rising to nearly 300 Detroiters a week, fell as testing expanded. The mayor’s message also evolved.\n\nOn March 16, he faulted the feds for not providing test kits to states.\n\nAfter an April 20 Free Press report examined how racial inequity and the coronavirus impacted African-Americans, Duggan began emphasizing the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Detroiters.\n\n“I guess I hadn’t appreciated that across this country you’ve got the president blaming the states for not having enough testing, you’ve got the states blaming the president for not having enough testing,” the mayor said during his May 6 briefing. “We don’t have time to blame anybody with what’s at stake with the African-American community and the mortality rates; blaming was a waste of time.\n\n“We just said we’re going to get this testing done.”\n\nRoberson, who left the Duggan administration in 2018 to become CEO at the nonprofit Focus: HOPE, said being a white man leading a predominantly Black city has broadened Duggan’s awareness.\n\nShe said Duggan bristled at criticism that improvements in Detroit mainly benefitted newcomers and the well-to-do.\n\n“The ‘Two Detroits’ conversation was irritating, but he adjusted to it,” she said. “Same thing with the impact of COVID-19 on Black folks.”\n\nJust when it seemed like Detroit was getting its arms around a once-in-a-century pandemic, a crisis that had been simmering for decades boiled over in Minneapolis — and quickly spread to Detroit.\n\nDetroit will protest\n\nThe first march in Detroit to protest the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer was mostly peaceful. Hundreds of people marched through Corktown and Southwest Detroit on May 29, under a clear blue sky. Many went home afterward.\n\nBut by nightfall, some protesters had mustered a block or so from city hall and squared off with police. Cops in riot gear dodged rocks and other flying objects while throngs of Black Lives Matter protesters choked on tear gas.\n\nThere was another night of chaos Saturday. And on Sunday May 31, Duggan announced a temporary curfew to prevent the kind of rioting and looting that was destroying parts of Minneapolis, Seattle and Portland.\n\nThe mayor and Police Chief James Craig placed the blame on outsiders — what Duggan called “a small group of people operating here who are intent on initiating destruction and violence.”\n\nDuggan said violent protesters were shifting the focus away from ending police brutality, telling reporters: “They came here to damage property and to throw rocks and bottles at our police.”\n\nPolice and marchers squared off Sunday night. Two days later, on June 2, police arrested 127 marchers who defied the 8 p.m. curfew.\n\nThere would be other skirmishes over the summer, including a violent confrontation late on Aug. 22 between police and protesters blocking Woodward Avenue that resulted in 44 arrests, but Detroit avoided the destruction and looting that plagued other American cities. Duggan said the credit belonged to Detroiters who stopped outsiders from disrespecting their city.\n\nDozens of people who lived outside Detroit were arrested over the summer along with Detroiters, but neither Duggan nor police provided any evidence that an Antifa-style leftist group had invaded Detroit and corrupted the protests, which were generally led by local activist Tristan Taylor and his niece Nakia-Renee Wallace. Duggan and Craig met with Taylor and Wallace in early June, but nothing came of the meeting.\n\nDetroit Will Breathe, the group Taylor and Wallace formed, later sued the city in federal court, accusing police and city officials of using brutality to violate protesters' free speech rights. The city accused protesters of assaulting police. A judge issued a temporary restraining order against police before the sides reached an agreement on rules of engagement. The case is pending.\n\nD style\n\nDuggan may be one of the best problem solvers in city hall, but he’s almost certainly the worst fortune-teller.\n\n“I was really thinking that 2020 was going to be the most successful year since I’ve been mayor, and it was all lining up that way,” he told the Free Press in May. “That was how I felt in February … And we’ll get back to it. But we’re going to lose several months.”\n\nWinston Churchill has been credited with saying “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” It’s a maxim that suits Duggan.\n\n“When Detroit started to get hit, there was a lot of, I thought, condescending coverage in the national media, like ‘Poor, broke Detroit won’t be able to survive this,’ ” he said during that May interview. “I think that drove a lot of us to say, ‘This is a different day. We’ve got a management team in place that is as well prepared as any city management team in the country and we’re going to knock this virus down faster than anybody in the country.' ”\n\nHe cited Birx’s praise during an April 20 news conference at the White House as affirmation of a new Detroit.\n\n“I think for a lot of us, that was a really important message that Detroit is strong, we’re not the city that was in bankruptcy and couldn’t handle our own problems,” he said. “We’re in a place where literally mayors from all over the country are calling us to say, ‘How did you handle this? … Can we use your playbook?’ ”\n\nScher, the JP Morgan Chase executive, says he knew Mayor Coleman Young and deals with mayors all over the world.\n\nHe called Duggan “one of the top two or three leaders I’ve ever dealt with.”\n\n“He is very focused, he gets into the weeds, he collaborates with people,” Scher said. “If anything, this crisis shows what happens when you have a leader like Mayor Duggan.”\n\nHe said the $100 million the bank invested in Detroit shortly after Duggan became mayor has grown to $200 million. Duggan said most of the investment is grants to small businesses and housing projects and loans that would not be available through traditional financing.\n\n“I think this has been a moment where he really has shined,” Roberson said. “If people didn’t think he knew what was going on beforehand, they get it now.”\n\nWhat many people — including some of his closest colleagues — don’t know about Duggan is what he does for fun.\n\nDuring one briefing, when the city was warning people not to congregate in parks, Duggan said he spent part of his weekend driving around Belle Isle a half dozen times.\n\nHe loves sports, cheering for his alma mater the University of Michigan, plays the card game euchre — always to win — and guzzles Diet Coke. He is said to be funny, with a quick wit, and values family.\n\nDuggan said his worst day on the job was March 17, when bus drivers walked off the job over safety concerns while Duggan’s father Patrick was dying at a hospice in Livonia.\n\nDuggan said he was with his father “who at that point only had hours to live” when the bus drivers struck.\n\n“So I left the hospice, went down to the terminal, listened to the drivers, and was convinced they were right.”\n\nThe mayor agreed to implement new safety measures, including suspending fares so passengers would not get too close to drivers, and increasing the bus cleaning schedule. After visiting two terminals, working out an agreement with union officials, and holding a news briefing to announce that drivers would be back on the job the next day, Duggan returned to the hospice to spend what would turn out to be one final evening with his father.\n\n“That was the day where it seemed like everything was happening at once,” he told the Free Press in May.\n\nAsked at that time what he does to relax, he said: “It’s been a long time since I’ve relaxed.”\n\nDuggan declined to discuss any personal or family matters. The mayor's four children are grown. He has two grandchildren.\n\nCritics say what drives Duggan is a lust for power and rewarding friends and favored contractors. They say Detroit's revival has mainly benefitted newcomers, while long-time residents and businesses are pushed out or passed over for things like tax breaks.\n\n“His agenda for inclusion is excluding people who have been here and who have a right to be here,” said Small, the community activist who is also vice chairwoman of the Detroit Charter Revision Commission.\n\nWhat some may see as cronyism or imperious behavior, others consider loyalty. Trusted Duggan aides have a tendency to follow him from job to job.\n\nIn May, Duggan hired Conrad Mallett Jr. as deputy mayor. The pair worked together at the DMC. Mallett, a consummate city hall insider whose father worked for Mayor Jerome Cavanagh in the 1960s, was also chairman of Duggan’s first campaign for mayor. A week later, when it appeared concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in federal prisons might lead to Kilpatrick being released 21 years early, Duggan said at his briefing: “I have a hard time being objective.”\n\nIn 2013, Kilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison after being convicted of two dozen counts of public corruption. His administration's financial mismanagement helped drive Detroit into bankruptcy. But Duggan worked with Kilpatrick’s father Bernard in the McNamara administration. And Duggan supported Kilpatrick’s 2001 and 2005 campaigns for mayor.\n\n“I have known Kwame since he was in high school and was a big part of supporting everything he did in his career,” Duggan said. “He is an enormously talented person, and I think that talent could do a lot of good in the community.”\n\nDuggan also refused to discipline Wiley, his then chief of staff, after the inspector general urged him to take action after discovering Wiley ordered mayoral appointees to delete emails showing they worked to support Make Your Date. Ha, the inspector general, criticized Duggan's inaction.\n\n\"Rules and discipline should apply universally and equally to all employees regardless of the position they hold,\" Ha wrote in the Free Press on Oct. 25, 2019. Wiley denied issuing a directive.\n\nSome of the harshest criticism of Duggan came from the managing partner of Jones Day, the law firm that oversaw Detroit's bankruptcy. In 2017, Duggan, who had worked closely with Kevyn Orr of Jones Day during his tenure as Detroit's emergency manager, threatened to sue the firm for endangering the city's financial future by underestimating the city's pension obligations.\n\n\"Filing this action would place the mayor in a long line of corrupt Detroit politicians who placed personal political ambition above an objective determination of the city's best interest,\" Stephen Brogan wrote in his letter, obtained by the Free Press through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\"If this case goes forward, we will prove that it does not — and cannot — serve the interest of your real client, the city of Detroit, but instead is designed only to serve the venal interests of a political hack who has placed personal animus and self-interest ahead of the truth.\"\n\nFicano, Duggan's former nemesis, said: \"I've not seen any sign of Mike Duggan involved in public corruption or pay-to-play, at least not for himself.\"\n\nCurrent and former colleagues say what drives Duggan, besides a good challenge, is making a difference.\n\n“He has an extraordinary determination to make the world a better place,” Mulhern said. “He’s the by-product of his parents. His mom was an incredible social worker, dedicated to at-risk kids … His dad was a conservative, ethical, old Irish Catholic judge. And Mike grew up on that. On changing the world. And he’s just driven to succeed.”\n\nDuggan credits much of whatever success he has had during the pandemic to his team’s experience.\n\n“If the coronavirus had hit my second year, it would have been a lot harder and the burden would have fallen a lot more on me,” he said. “It is far more challenging to do this when your team is just getting started.”\n\nStill, Wiley said Duggan is very involved in everything that’s happening.\n\n“He’s so immersed in details it’s unbelievable,” she said.\n\nWhat's next\n\nMany months before Duggan announced that he would seek a third term, he already was looking past the pandemic.\n\nOne way he planned to promote the city was by pointing to how well the city performed in a crisis.\n\n“Where do you invest in the post-coronavirus world?” he asked. “You look at Detroit and it’s got its act together.”\n\nRather than expect to be rewarded for creating a testing center that became a model for other cities, or for helping Detroit achieve a lower infection rate than the rest of Michigan, Wiley said Duggan wants to be known as the mayor who put Detroit’s dysfunctional past behind it.\n\nWhen Duggan took office in 2014, firefighters were complaining they didn’t have toilet paper, even though there was plenty of TP sitting in a city warehouse. The mayor’s team got the toilet paper to the firehouses — and made sure it didn’t happen again.\n\n“How do we come back stronger in a way that emphasizes our competitive edge, our strength as a city?” Wiley said. “I think that’s one thing he wants to be known for.”\n\nNo matter how much progress the city has made, Wiley said Duggan still isn’t satisfied.\n\n“‘We’ve got to think about the reboot,’” she quoted him as saying. “‘Once we’re out of the crisis, how do we rebuild?’”\n\nOne way the city will rebuild is by tearing down. After Duggan revamped his $250 million bond proposal, the city council voted 5-4 in July to put it on the Nov. 3 ballot. Voters overwhelmingly approved the plan, which also calls for rehabilitating thousands of homes.\n\nRoberson said Duggan rose to the challenge of the pandemic, but will soon have new problems, like potentially higher office vacancy rates and lower income tax revenues as people continue to work from home.\n\n“Detroit’s comeback has always been tenuous,” she said. “And hopeful that no perfect storm happened. And it happened.”\n\n“Can we do it again?” Roberson added. “This will be the challenge of whether Detroit really had a comeback.”\n\n“This ‘after COVID’ will be what Mike is judged on.”\n\nDuggan sounds like he’s comfortable with that — and maybe even encourages it.\n\n“This is the nature of the business, and as the city’s coming back, the expectations are higher and the criticisms grow,” he said. “This is a good thing.”\n\nM.L.

The move is intended to prevent lakes from shrinking too much. But a statement from the utility said that without rain, water levels will still likely fall below normal on lakes including Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Harris, Martin and Smith. Parts of the state haven’t had substantial rainfall in weeks, and a federal assessment shows more than 80% of Alabama is abnormally dry or in a drought. Conditions are worse in eastern and central parts of Alabama. Montgomery is more than 6 inches below normal, and Troy is more than 10 inches below normal rainfall. Totals are more than 3 inches off in Birmingham.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Scientists have confirmed an increasing number of moon jellyfish floating around Juneau waters. The Juneau Empire reported Friday that warm ocean temperatures and plentiful food in the form of zooplankton have contributed to the increased sightings. A marine biology professor said the moon jellyfish known as Aurelia aurita have reached maturity after spawning in early spring. Experts said residents could be stung and urge people not to pick up beached jellyfish. Scientists said the sting of a moon jellyfish is considered less painful than the sting of some others. Experts have recommended watching the jellyfish from a pier for the best views. Scientists said there are concerns that too many jellyfish in the water could throw off the ecosystem because they would eat too many zooplankton\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A major construction project to widen Interstate 17 north of Phoenix is moving closer to its start date, as the Arizona Department of Transportation prepares a request for proposals for construction companies that want to be part of the work. The Anthem to Sunset Point rest area project, which is moving ahead after a $90 million federal grant announced earlier this year, should break ground in 2021 and be done by 2023, according to the department. A host of elected officials gathered at the outlet mall in Anthem on Thursday to highlight how the widening will benefit the estimated 1 million residents and visitors who travel the road annually, particularly those who get stuck in hours-long backups on weekends. Delays lasting several hours are a weekend tradition. Crashes, even minor, clog the roadway as people head north to campsites and cabins on Fridays and Saturdays, and as they head home on Sundays. The plan will add a third northbound and third southbound lane to the road between Anthem and Black Canyon City.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: A casino in Pine Bluff held a surprise “soft opening,” four days before its planned grand opening. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported the Oklahoma-based Quapaw Nation’s Saracen Casino Annex opened at 6 p.m. Friday with about 300 slot machines and a full-service bar. Saracen Casino Resort spokesman Carlton Saffa said the facility is a preview of the 80,000-square-foot casino that will have a 13-floor, 300-room hotel across the street by the end of next year. Saffa said the soft opening was planned to be invitation-only, but those plans were changed because of high interest. The Arkansas Racing Commission in June approved the license for the casino after Arkansas voters last year approved a constitutional amendment legalizing casino gambling in four counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Investigators completed a two-week examination of the charred wreckage of a scuba diving boat and could not determine what ignited the fire that killed 34 people off the Southern California coast, a law enforcement official said Friday. The boat, named Conception, was anchored just off Santa Cruz Island when it caught fire and sank early on Sept. 2. It was raised and brought to Port Hueneme, a naval base northwest of Los Angeles, where specially trained teams from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tried to figure out what sparked the blaze. They completed their work there without finding the cause, but the investigation will continue, said the official, who was not authorized to release the information publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Pieces of the boat have been sent to labs for additional testing, and investigators are poring through hundreds of documents seized from the boat’s operator, Truth Aquatics Inc., the official said. Some parts of the boat washed away when it was submerged.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Gov. Jared Polis, a solar developer, an energy company and a steel plant have announced a large solar project in Pueblo. The Chieftain reported Lightsource BP would build, own and operate the proposed 240-megawatt solar facility on property owned by EVRAZ North America, a steel manufacturer. The project would sell its power to Xcel Energy, which would sell it to the steel plant. The Bighorn Solar Project would be one of the state’s largest. It would give EVRAZ a long-term contract that provides the steel mill price certainty through 2041. EVRAZ North America president and CEO Skip Herald said Friday the solar power makes possible a planned $480 million investment aimed at producing longer railroad rails. The mill employs about 1,100 people. The solar project would create about 300 jobs in construction, operations and maintenance.\n\nConnecticut\n\nLebanon: A generations-old question over who owns the mile-long green at the center of the city has been resolved after two years of negotiations and court hearings. The green, little changed from the days when French troops camped on it during the Revolutionary War, is the center of community life in the town of just over 7,200 people. But several years ago, plans to expand a library on the edge of the green were thwarted because a document dating to 1705 showed the green actually belonged to the “heirs and assigns” of the 17th and early 18th-century investors in the property. This month a judge signed off on the last piece of a plan that awards ownership and control of most of the land to the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Incyte, a Wilmington pharmaceutical company, is preparing to expand its Augustine Cut-Off headquarters. Two years ago, the company opened a 154,000 square-foot office building next to the former John Wanamaker building, which has served as the company’s home since 2014. The latest expansion, consisting of a six-story lab and office building, and a two-story parking deck, is supposed to bring all of Incyte’s employees to one campus. Some of Incyte’s roughly 700 employees work in leased spaces in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington. Since 2014, the company has consistently outgrown its buildings, said Paula Swain, Incyte’s head of human resources of facilities. New Castle County Council approved the expansion project Tuesday. Swain expects construction to begin in October and end in about two years.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Beach Drive has reopened after a major rehabilitation project, WUSA-TV reported. Crews completed the fourth and final section of more than 6 miles of work on Friday. Construction crews kept busy on Beach Drive until the bitter end, using every minute leading up to the noon Friday deadline to ensure the 23,000 tons of new asphalt was ready for drivers. The National Park Service, along with the Federal Highway Administration, oversaw the project, installing new pavement markers, center-line rumble strips, guardrails and road signs. It’s a major improvement from the potholes of before. Crews also installed a new drainage system. Fourteen new retention ponds now prevent runoff into Rock Creek. Because Beach Drive is part of a National Park, the road was not expanded beyond its original footprint.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Buena Vista: Walt Disney World on Friday introduced its newest way to get around the resort: an aerial cable car system that whisks visitors from hotels to theme parks three stories above the ground while going 11 mph. The Disney Skyliner cable cars opening to visitors on Sunday are the latest addition to one of the largest private transportation systems in the U.S. The almost 300 enclosed cable cars join 423 buses, 61 mini-vans (appropriately named Minnie Vans), 30 parking lot trams, 29 watercraft and 12 monorail trains. With the Skyliner air gondolas, visitors get neon-colored cars painted with the images of almost two dozen Disney characters taking them on the three lines to five stations where they can access nine resorts and two parks. Disney World has four theme parks and more than two dozen resorts. No more than 10 people are allowed in each cable car. A car will arrive every 10 seconds, allowing the cabins to handle about 3,000 people an hour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: An ongoing drought has made outdoor burning in Georgia more dangerous than previous years, state officials said. In the past three months, the Georgia Forestry Commission said firefighters have responded to – on average – about 41% more fires. Drought conditions are worsening, affecting more than 11 million people and threatening crops across a five-state area from Louisiana to South Carolina, federal officials said. In Georgia, residents should postpone open burning if conditions are not favorable, Forestry Commission Chief of Protection Frank Sorrells said in a statement. The main cause of wildfires is debris that escapes from a fire, he said. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division has summer burning restrictions in place in 54 Georgia counties to protect air quality. State officials will resume issuing burn permits in these counties once the restrictions are lifted on Tuesday, The Telegraph reported.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Retail firm DFS Hawaii plans to lay off 165 of its 660 employees in three locations across Hawaii’s islands, officials said. Financial losses from decreases in the international travel market prompted the staff reductions announced Thursday, company officials said. DFS Hawaii said positions are expected to be cut at two Oahu locations, including T Galleria in Waikiki and the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, as well as the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport on the Big Island. The affected employees worked in the management, sales, operations and clerical departments. Eligible workers will receive severance packages based on their individual years of service, officials said. DFS Hawaii caters largely to international travelers. The company’s flagship store in Waikiki opened in 1975 and is now the chain’s sixth-largest galleria store worldwide. The first DFS Hawaii duty-free shop in the United States was established at what was previously known as Honolulu International Airport, now the Inouye International Airport.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: KIVI-TV reported The College of Idaho is teaming with local company indieDwell to build new dorms out of repurposed shipping containers. Associate Dean of Students Jen Nelson said the school was eager to find a housing solution that would be quick and affordable. The dorm units will have five single rooms surrounding a common area. Once the shipping container dorms are completed early next year, the school will have 54 new rooms. School officials said that will help alleviate the shortage. At this time, students are even being housed in the vacant President’s House on campus.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Barack and Michelle Obama will speak next month at a summit in Chicago focused on the vision for the Obama Presidential Center. The event will include young leaders from around the world and participants of programs run by the Obama Foundation. It’s the third such summit. Officials said the theme is “Places Reveal Our Purpose.” Organizers said the summit will show how the Obama Presidential Center “connects to a growing global network of leaders.” The center is planned along the lakefront of Chicago’s South Side. It’s near where Obama started his political career and lived with his family. The $500 million center is expected to house a public library branch, house multimedia collections and have community programs, among other things.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Federal officials said an Indiana company is recalling 744 pounds of ready-to-eat pork products which might be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced late Saturday that the products by Fisher Packing Company in Redkey were shipped statewide. They were packaged in late August. The products include smoked ham, smoked ham shanks and Canadian bacon. They have the establishment number “74SEIN” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The products should be thrown out or returned. Federal officials said the problem was discovered when the company found that a sample confirmed positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Consumption of foods contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause a serious infection primarily affecting the elderly, people with weak immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns. There have no confirmed illness reports.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowa now has 24.9 million pigs on farms, a record number and up 6% from last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Friday for the quarter ending Sept. 1. It showed Iowa farms have just over 1 million breeding pigs and 23.9 million market hogs, or those raised for meat. The growth in hog numbers comes as environmental groups are trying to force the state to slow expansion of pig farms. A state court judge on Sept. 10 said two environmental groups may proceed to trial in their lawsuit alleging the state’s policy of expanding hog farms and its voluntary farm pollution controls violate the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River. The USDA said the national inventory of pigs is at 77.7 million, the highest number for Sept. 1 since records began in 1988.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State wildlife officials are working on plans to stop a continuing drop in the number of young people who are interested in hunting, in part because the decline could lead to fewer dollars for conservation. For years, Kansas encouraged young hunters by conducting guided hunts. But those classes are losing participants for a variety of reasons, including more entertainment options, more children living in cities and a lack of public hunting land, Kansas News Service reported. Kansas remains popular for out-of-state hunters, with the number of licenses and permits more than doubling over the past two decades to more than 150,000. But in-state licenses have declined about 14%. Hunting licenses contribute about $28 million to the state’s conservation coffers, which gets about 60% of its funding from the licenses. Because out-of-state licenses cost more, their popularity has offset having fewer Kansas hunters. But 2019 was the first in five years where nonresident sales declined. Hunting advocates said one factor contributing to the decline is a lack of public hunting land. Less than 2% of Kansas land is free for public hunting, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Tourism.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Kentucky’s Division of Water and Department for Public Health are issuing a public health advisory for harmful algal bloom along the Ohio River. The advisory is for people using the waters for recreation. The advisory area is from the McAlpine Dam near Louisville to the Greenup Dam near Greenup in northeastern Kentucky. State officials also issued an advisory for Briggs Lake near Russellville. The advisory means algal toxins have been found at various locations along the water. Swimming, wading, and other water activities are not recommended during the advisory. State officials said ingested water might increase the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. It can also cause skin irritation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The percentage of Louisiana’s people living in poverty has dipped slightly, but the state remains among the poorest in the nation. New data released Thursday from the Census Bureau showed 18.6% of Louisiana residents lived below the poverty line in 2018, compared to 19.7% a year earlier. By comparison, the national average in 2018 was 11.8%. The statistics show more than one-quarter of Louisiana’s children live in poverty. The state remained third-highest in the nation for its poverty rate, behind only Mississippi and New Mexico. Seven states had poverty rates of less than 10%. The census data shows Louisiana’s median income level reached $47,905 last year, well behind the U.S. average of $61,937.\n\nMaine\n\nActon: The devastating toll of ticks on New England’s moose herd has caused the region’s population to shrink, and experts worry it could get worse with climate change. The northern New England states are home to thousands of moose, but the herd has dwindled in the last decade, in part because of the winter ticks. The ticks infest moose and suck their blood dry, and sometimes tens of thousands are found on a single animal. Maine has the largest moose population east of Alaska and was home to some 76,000 animals about seven years ago. Lee Kantar, Maine’s moose biologist, said that number might now be as low as 50,000. Scientists in Maine are entering the final year of a multiyear study of the moose population in its northern and western areas.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An investigation at the U.S. Naval Academy has found it is “unlikely” a rope and knot found over a door in a construction area was meant to be a noose, but the possibility could not be definitively ruled out. The academy announced Friday that the rope resembled a common construction device used to hoist items, although it was draped over a door “for no readily apparent reason.” The academy said the investigation didn’t discover who placed the rope over the door or identify any existing racial animus on the job site. The academy announced an investigation earlier this month after receiving notice from the Caucus of African-American Leaders. The caucus was contacted anonymously about the rope on Aug. 28, the 56th anniversary of the March on Washington.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Starting on Wednesday, the USS Constitution, the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat, will be open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. The ship, berthed in Boston, will be closed on Oct. 22, then open for free public visits from Wednesday until Sunday from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. Guests can walk the ship at their own pace and ask questions to the ship’s active-duty Navy sailors, or listen to sailors give presentations on the ship’s history every 30 minutes. The USS Constitution played a crucial role in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812, defending sea lanes from 1797 to 1855. It earned its nickname “Old Ironsides” during the War of 1812.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State and local health departments will conduct aerial spraying for the first time since 1980 to combat a rare mosquito-borne virus that has killed three people and been recorded across the southern half of the state. The aerial spraying is set to begin Sunday and will include 14 counties where eastern equine encephalitis has been confirmed in humans or animals. The weather might determine the actual spraying schedule. Other states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have recently done aerial sprays. Michigan is encouraging officials in affected counties to consider postponing or rescheduling evening outdoor events until there is a hard frost. The number of U.S. deaths and illnesses from the virus are higher than usual this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Bishop John Francis Kinney, bishop emeritus of St. Cloud, died Friday at Quiet Oaks Hospice in St. Augusta, according to the Diocese of St. Cloud. He was 82. Kinney, the eighth bishop of St. Cloud, headed the diocese from 1995 until his retirement in 2013. He spent 53 years as a priest, with 39 as bishop. During his retirement, Kinney lived at the Speltz House in Sauk Rapids. Kinney presided over the diocese during turbulent times as the Catholic Church became mired in allegations of sex abuse. In a 2016 interview with the St. Cloud Times, Kinney said the revelation of clergy sexual abuse was the most difficult thing he had to work through. Following the revelations, Kinney set up listening and information sessions that he attended in parishes around the diocese. In 1993, the then-National Conference of Catholic Bishops appointed him to chair an Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse. During his tenure as chair, the ad hoc committee published “Restoring Trust,” a document then used by dioceses to address sexual abuse in the church.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will get $1.25 million to evaluate the effects of freshwater from a Louisiana spillway on dolphins and sea turtles in the Mississippi Sound. The money from federal oil and gas revenue-sharing will go to Mississippi State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Gov. Phil Bryant said in a news release Friday. The study will examine the abundance, health and habitat of dolphins and sea turtles in the area. The federal government said at least 310 dolphins have been stranded since February from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, 130 of them in Mississippi. Another 101 were in Louisiana, 42 in Alabama and 37 in Florida. Some have had skin lesions consistent with freshwater exposure, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Army Corps of Engineers opened the Bonnet Carré Spillway twice this year to protect New Orleans levees, sending Mississippi River water into the Mississippi Sound for a total of 123 days. The first opening was from Feb. 27 until April 11 and the second from May 10 to July 27. The number of strandings peaked in May and fell sharply in June, according to NOAA.\n\nMissouri\n\nHannibal: Against all odds, what appears to be Samuel Clemens’ signature has turned up on the wall of the cave he made famous in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” In the mid-1800s, long before he adopted the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens and his young pals romped around the cave on the outskirts of Hannibal. As a group of Twain scholars toured what is known as the Mark Twain Cave this summer, cave owner Linda Coleberd and three other enthusiasts broke off in search of Clemens’ signature. It was long believed to be among the thousands of names signed on the limestone walls. A beam from a lone flashlight glanced along the cave wall and Lovell saw the name “Clemens” written in pencil. Experts said it is almost certainly authentic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A group of history fans saw how ground-penetrating radar can be used to help discover unmarked graves Thursday, which was the first day of the 46th Montana History Conference in Helena. During a trip to the Silver City Cemetery north of Helena, University of Montana Ph.D. candidate Ethan Ryan, an archaeologist and ground-penetrating radar specialist, explained that he uses a 400 megahertz device with an electromagnetic pulse to detect anomalies underground. He can then use surface clues and disturbances to determine whether an unmarked grave might be nearby. Before the group went to the cemetery, Pam Attardo, preservation officer for the City of Helena and Lewis and Clark County, spoke about the ongoing preservation efforts happening there. She said the cemetery dates back to the days of the Wild West and is home to a number of graves, both marked and unmarked. Attardo shared some myths about the location, including a story about a group of outlaws captured in Silver City and eventually buried in the cemetery. However, no historical record of any such event exists, the Independent Record reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium is holding a new Halloween event meant to replace the zoo’s previous long-running Spooktacular trick-or-treat event. The zoo’s Ghouls and Glow event kicked off Friday and will be held Thursdays through Saturdays every week until its last run on Oct. 24-25. The event will feature 400 lantern displays at the Bay Family’s Children’s Adventure Trails. Visitors will encounter dancing skeletons, candy monsters, jack-o-lanterns, ghosts, witches, wizards, spider web arches and a mummy band. A number of bats, vultures, spiders and black cats will also light up the trails. Hundreds of hand-carved pumpkins will glisten along the zoo’s pathways, as well as a nearly 15-foot-tall pumpkin tree. Tickets for the event, ranging from $8 to $18, are available online and at the zoo.\n\nNevada\n\nFernley:A proposed industrial park east of Reno could benefit efforts to protect part of a desert trail used by the Donner Party and thousands of others as they journeyed west in the 1840s, historic preservationists and a federal official said. Known as the Fernley Swales, the deep sand trenches and grooves that are part of the California National Historic Trail were carved by wagons and oxen in the Forty Mile Desert between the Humboldt and Carson rivers just north of U.S. Interstate 80. The mile-long swales on the edge of the town of Fernley were protected in 2001 by a U.S. Bureau of Land Management easement that has remained in place despite changes in ownership. But the site is near a shooting range and often the scene of illegal dumping. Signs marking its historical significance are regularly riddled with bullet holes. Earlier this year, Mark IV Capital bought land in and around Fernley for its new Victory Logistics Center, including the parcel with the easement. Jon Nowlin, a member of the California-Nevada chapter of the Oregon-California Trail Association, said approval of Mark IV’s plans would require the dedication of some land to open space. Victoria Wilkins, acting field manager for the BLM’s Sierra Front Field Office, said it’s rare for the agency to have a historical easement surrounded by an industrial park, but the development could benefit the swales.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: One of two New Hampshire homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is on the market. The Toufic H. Kalil house in Manchester was built in 1955 and is an example the “Usonian Automatic” houses Wright designed as a more moderately-priced option for the post-war middle class. The house made of modular concrete blocks was built for a doctor and his wife who were inspired by the home of a friend whose Wright house was built on the same street. That property, the Zimmerman house, is now part of the Currier Museum of Art. The Kalil house is now for sale for the first time, being offered at $850,000 by the Paula Martin Group. It includes the original furniture and fixtures.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: State attorney general Gurbir Grewal is ordering two counties to end cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities. Grewal’s announcement Friday came a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested more than 50 people in New Jersey. A directive this year limits law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE. But sheriff’s departments in Cape May and Monmouth counties have separate agreements to perform some immigration functions. Critics of New Jersey’s directive said it makes it easier for violent criminals to be released before they can be handed over to immigration authorities. Grewal said Friday the directive gives local authorities the ability to identify dangerous individuals to ICE for detention. Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said Friday he would fight the order. Cape May County’s sheriff didn’t immediately respond to an email.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Flags across New Mexico are at half-staff in honor of state Sen. Carlos Cisneros, who died earlier this month of a heart attack. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered flags lowered Friday in recognition of the long-time lawmaker lying in state. The senator’s casket, blanketed by a white cloth adorned with the state seal, was in place in the Rotunda for a public viewing. A funnel service is scheduled Saturday at a church in Santa Fe. Cisneros had recently announced his bid for re-election to represent a vast district that stretches from the state line with Colorado to the outskirts of Los Alamos, including Taos, Peñasco, Truchas and Pojoaque Pueblo. Cisneros joined the Senate in 1985 and went on to play a leading role in annual budget negotiations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A woman fighting cancer for the third time is thanking police for getting her to treatment after her car got stuck in United Nations-related traffic. Gabriela DeMassi said two officers volunteered to escort her and her parents through Thursday morning’s jam after she and her mother asked officers if they knew a better way to Manhattan’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After getting through traffic, DeMassi, 28, said one officer greeted her with a smile and said: “Keep up the good fight. Never give up! You got this!” DeMassi recounted the experience in an Instagram post that went viral within the law enforcement community. NYPD Chief Terence Monahan left a comment thanking DeMassi for sharing the story. He closed by echoing the officer’s words: “You got this!”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s health agency is urging people to make sure their vaccinations are up to date after several confirmed mumps cases at two private universities. The state Department of Health and Human Services said there have been seven confirmed cases combined at Elon University and High Point University as of Thursday. State and local public health workers are responding in part by vaccinating susceptible groups on campus. Mumps is a contagious virus causing swollen glands, puffy cheeks and fever, and can lead to more serious complications. DHHS said anyone with confirmed or suspected mumps needs to stay home and limit personal contact for five days, or until mumps is ruled out. The agency said vaccinations are the most effective way to prevent mumps or limit complications should mumps still occur.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The remains of a North Dakota sailor who died during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are coming home for burial at the state’s Veterans Cemetery. KFGO-TV reported that the remains of Radioman 2nd Class Floyd Wells were identified in June. His remains are arriving at Hector International Airport on Monday and burial is scheduled for Tuesday. Wells was a native of Cavalier. He was assigned to the USS Arizona, which was struck by torpedoes. The attack on the ship killed 1,177.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: The role of Ohio’s formidable run of early U.S. presidents in establishing lasting national customs like the White House Easter egg roll and West Wing war room is explored in a history exhibition running through late December. “The Ohio Presidents: Surprising Legacies “ opened this month at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio, located in Lancaster about 30 miles southeast of Columbus. Objects include clothing, furniture, personal items and campaign posters of William Henry Harrison, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding. Curator Christine Fowler Shearer said the show features fun facts about the presidents that aren’t common knowledge. The artifacts and photographs were gathered from the Library of Congress, Ohio History Connection and elsewhere.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The new chief of the Cherokee Nation plans to invest $16 million into the tribe’s language preservation program, including a new cabinet-level position focused on its language, culture and community. Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. announced the “Durbin Feeling Cherokee Language Preservation Act” in a statement on Friday. Feeling is a leading Cherokee linguist and one of an estimated 2,000 people the tribe identifies as “first-language” speakers, or those whose native language is Cherokee. The new plan includes a $5 million renovation of the former Cherokee Casino Tahlequah building into a new language center, and a $1.5 million annual appropriation for the next five years for its operation. The largest American Indian tribe in the United States, the 370,000-member Cherokee Nation is headquartered in Tahlequah.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Oregon Supreme Court – the oldest government building on the Capitol Mall – is set to empty out in October for two years of renovations including earthquake reinforcements and safety upgrades. Services at the century-old court building, which includes the Oregon Supreme Court and the Oregon Court of Appeals courtroom, the State of Oregon Law Library, the Oregon Judicial Department and Appellate Court Records, will be spread to different locations throughout Salem. It will cost about $51 million and displace 56 employees, according to Oregon Judicial Department spokesman Todd Sprague. Over the past year, staff members have hauled tens of thousands of volumes from its law library collection to new locations. The second-floor library has been home to historic documents that date to the 15th century.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have been found in six Pennsylvania counties, along with one human case. The state’s West Nile Control Program said the mosquitoes were found Friday in Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster and Philadelphia counties. The human case of West Nile virus was discovered in Chester County. Friday was the last routine surveillance and reporting day for 2019, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection’s website. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne sickness that might cause encephalitis, a brain irritation. Mild infections can produce fever, headaches, body aches, skin rash and swollen lymph glands.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Officials said they have decided to dismantle the city’s first two-way bike lane a month after its installation following public criticism. The Providence Journal reported the city’s recent decision is expected to cost $127,500. Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office said the lane was completed the week of Sept. 9 and cost $63,500. The dismantling process will begin this fall and will cost $64,000. After the lane’s construction, residents began complaining it made the rest of Easton Street too narrow. Louise Ely said cars would have nowhere to move if an ambulance drove by since the lane is on one side of the street. Sarah Mitchell, chairwoman of the Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition, said the city should do more outreach to educate people about how to use these lanes.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCongaree National Park: A timber company is selling some swamp and forest land to a conservation group that hopes to donate the land to Congaree National Park. Friends of Congaree Swamp bought the 214 acres from Weyerhaeuser for $783,000. The State newspaper reported the land is along Running Lake Creek and has trees so thick that areas remain darkened by shade in the middle of the day. Friends of Congaree Swamp used a combination of money from the state and federal governments, private donations and fines from wetland violations. The federal government will have to approve the transfer to the national park near Columbia, which could take some time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Officials at Custer State Park said 25,000 people turned out to watch this year’s annual buffalo roundup. The Rapid City Journal reported hundreds of bison were herded into corrals during the 54th annual roundup on Friday. Park resource manager Mark Hendrix said of the 1,460 animals in herd, 470 will be sent to auction Nov. 6. He said staff attempts to keep the herd at an average of 1,000 animals to maintain the ecological balance in the 71,000-acre park south of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Two Memphis schools won the Blue Ribbon designation this year, one of the highest honors from the U.S. Department of Education, given to just 362 schools nationwide. Campus School and Maxine Smith STEAM Academy were recognized for their high scores on state and national tests. They were among six schools in Tennessee to earn the award this year. The designation does not come with financial awards, but is a coveted label. Campus School is a contract school run by the University of Memphis. The elementary school is known for its high test scores and frequently tops district ratings. This spring, 74% of students scored proficient in reading and writing, compared with 21% of students in the district and 34% statewide. Maxine Smith STEAM Academy is a middle school that Shelby County Schools opened in 2014 to serve high-performing students that pass admission tests.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A county administrator is apologizing for saying Gov. Greg Abbott “hates trees because one fell on him.” The Texas Tribune reports that the comment made Friday by Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat, during a panel discussion was first reported in a tweet by the online magazine The Federalist. Abbott, a Republican, has been paralyzed from the waist down since 1984 when a tree fell on him in Houston while he was jogging. Eckhardt said on her website and in a tweet that she “made a mistake” and apologizes to Abbott. Eckhardt said she “made a flippant comment that was inappropriate.” Eckhardt’s comments came during a discussion about the Texas Legislature overriding local ordinances such one in Austin regarding the cutting down of trees.\n\nUtah\n\nAntelope Island State Park: Authorities said a 22-year-old Utah woman hiking at Antelope Island State Park suffered a broken leg and a laceration on her other leg when she was charged by a bison. Officials said the woman was on an established trail while running toward a companion when the incident occurred Friday night in a remote area and that it’s not clear what prompted the bison to charge. The woman’s identity wasn’t released. Utah State Parks Lt. Eric Stucki said the woman lay still after the bison used its head to throw her into the air and that the animal then nudged her with its nose before moving off. Antelope Island wildlife include hundreds of bison. The state park is connected to the Great Salt Lake’s southeastern shore by a 7-mile-long causeway.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources is beginning to receive the results of tests for a class of chemicals known as PFAS in public water supplies and so far all met public drinking water standards. The testing is part of a state law that requires the testing of an estimated 590 water systems across for the presence of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl levels in public drinking water. So far, the results have come back for 45 system and all met all the state standards with concentrations below 20 parts per trillion. Bryan Redmond of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division said the initial sampling results are encouraging. The deadline for testing is Dec. 1. PFAS chemicals were widely used in firefighting foam, nonstick cookware and other products.\n\nVirginia\n\nLovingston: A vehicle has hit and killed a yak who rose to internet fame by making his great escape in Virginia while on the way to a butcher shop. The Washington Post reported the owner of the yak, Robert Cissell, said on social media that the animal named Meteor died Friday morning on U.S. 29 in Nelson County. Meteor had been on the loose since Sept. 10, when he kicked off the back door of a livestock trailer and ran into the mountains. Nelson County Animal Control officer Kevin Wright said there were no witnesses to Friday’s collision. He said a commercial vehicle might have hit the yak and kept going. The Nelson County Farm Bureau wrote a tribute to Meteor on social media that ended with, “Roam free, Meteor!”\n\nWashington\n\nSnohomish: A multiracial family has raised concerns after Ku Klux Klan symbols were spray painted on multiple trees near their home. KOMO-TV reported that the Anderson family has had tough conversations about race with their four adopted children, but the racially offensive graffiti crossed a line. The family sid the teenage son discovered the KKK symbols on six to eight trees as he walked through the woods right next to their house heading to the lake. Snohomish County deputies said an investigation is underway. Authorities said they have not received any other reports and they do not have any leads. The family said the community is usually friendly and welcoming, but a conversation clearly needs to happen.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s U.S. senators want to make the New River Gorge a national park. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin on Thursday introduced the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve Designation Act. The lawmakers said the move will boost the local economy and tourism in the area, citing a study that said national-park status is shown to increase the number of visitors by 21%. The proposal would allow hunting and fishing at the park. The New River Gorge is the site of the annual Bridge Day festival, where many gather to watch people base jump into the gorge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State utility regulators have authorized the construction of a $500 million power line, despite claims that they ignored complaints, concerns and alternative solutions. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that the Public Service Commission approved the plan Thursday, rejecting accusations of a conflict of interest that were brought by two conservation groups, the Driftless Area Land Conservancy and Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. The groups said the will appeal. The Cardinal-Hickory Creek line would run between Dubuque, Iowa, and Middleton, west of Madison. Construction is expected to start in 2021. Project supporters said it will allow for the transmission of more carbon-free electricity and save customers money. But critics said the state could transition to renewable energy without damaging natural areas along the planned route of the proposed power line.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in northwest Wyoming will use renewable energy to power its lifts and other operations. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reported that resort officials announced that they would enter Lower Valley Energy’s Green Power program for customers and begin drawing energy from the Horse Butte Wind Farm near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Phil Cameron of Jackson-based Energy Conservation Works sid Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is one of only a handful of ski resorts across the country to fully move to renewable energy. Over the last two years hundreds of businesses and residents of Teton County have converted to green power. Among them are Snow King Mountain Resort and Jackson Hole Airport.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/30"}]}

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday to combat bird flu, which has spread to more than a quarter of all the state's dairies in the last month and infected 34 state residents.\n\nThe emergency declaration expands the amount of money Newsom can spend fighting the H5N1 virus, which was first detected in California cows in August, and has swept across the nation’s largest dairy-producing state. As of Monday, 649 dairies have had infections, including 313 in the last 30 days and about 120 just in a week, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.\n\nAll human infections reported so far had been mild until Wednesday when federal officials said a Louisiana resident hospitalized with a presumptive bird flu infection has the first U.S. case classified as \"severe.\"\n\nThe person had been exposed to sick and dead birds suspected of being infected with H5N1, the Louisiana health department said last week. It is the same flu strain that sickened a teen in Canada, but not the one that has infected cattle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe exact cause of the spread among California cattle isn't clear, said Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies, which represents most California dairy farmers. Movement of cattle is thought to have first led to the spread, though later, shared milking equipment and personnel likely drove the infections. Testing has dramatically increased to detect outbreaks earlier, too.\n\nWhat's known is the virus has substantial effects on the cows that produce tens of thousands of gallons of milk each year, the farmworkers who care for the livestock, and farmers trying to keep businesses afloat.\n\n“You do not want this on your herd,” Raudabaugh said. “It’s that bad.”\n\nConsumers shouldn’t see impacts to pasteurized milk, cheese, or yogurt at their grocery stores, said Raudabaugh. The pasteurization process destroys the virus’s ability to live or replicate, making pasteurized milk safe.\n\nHowever, raw milk has been shown to contain the virus. Two raw milk producers in California have had to recall products due to virus present in unpasteurized milk, including one product announced Saturday.\n\nThere have now been 61 confirmed human cases of bird flu in the U.S. during 2024, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat happens to dairies affected by bird flu\n\nOver the long term, Raudabaugh worries about farms' ability to recoup losses in milk production when cows recover.\n\nCalifornia has approximately 1,100 dairies, mostly concentrated in the state's fertile Central Valley, that produce approximately 41 billion gallons of milk annually for an economic value of nearly $20 billion as of 2018, according to a 2019 University of California, Davis, analysis for the California Milk Advisory Board.\n\nBird flu was first detected in Texas dairies in the spring after officials believe one herd was infected by wild birds. So far, 16 states have had outbreaks in cows, with 865 herds affected. Three-quarters of infected herds come from California.\n\nIn California, outbreaks in dairies started in and around Tulare County, before moving up and down the Central Valley and now trekking northward, Raudabaugh said.\n\nWhat does a state of emergency do?\n\nCalifornia’s declaration opens up more funding to respond to the crisis, similar to a natural disaster like a forest fire.\n\nThe proclamation by Newsom, a Democrat, allows the state to streamline and expedite resources to address the rapid spread of bird flu across the state, his office said in a news release.\n\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement. “Building on California's testing and monitoring system ‒ the largest in the nation ‒ we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information.”\n\nOver the summer, Colorado experienced large bird flu outbreaks among poultry and cattle that led to several outbreaks among livestock workers. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, issued a disaster declaration then to help poultry farms.\n\nWhat happens to cows and other animals when they catch bird flu\n\nThe H5N1 virus typically doesn't kill cows the way it does birds and chickens. Estimates have placed mortality rates in cows at no more than 2%.\n\nOnce cows are sick, their digestion process of ruminating stops, they stop drinking water, and they develop a fever, Raudabaugh said. In triple-digit Central Valley temperatures, this may have resulted in some cows dying from heat stress in a hot October. The cool fall and winter months in California have meant fewer cows are getting severely ill and dying, she said.\n\nBefore cows develop these symptoms, their milk shows signs of the virus, Dr. K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, an organization representing veterinarians who treat cows, previously told USA TODAY. Bulk milk testing can help detect bird flu circulating in herds before large outbreaks occur.\n\nAfter a fever breaks, cows resume eating, drinking and ruminating. The milk production then returns over several weeks, but it still levels out about 20% to 30% less than before a bird flu infection, said Dr. Michael Payne, a researcher and outreach coordinator at the Western Institute of Food Safety and Security, a center within the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nCats have also gotten sick with bird flu circulating in cows. When officials first identified bird flu in Texas cows, they did so, in part, from dead cats that likely drank raw milk in barns. Last week, Los Angeles County health officials identified two indoor cats that died from suspected bird flu infections after they drank recalled raw milk.\n\nWhat happens to people with bird flu\n\nSo far, most people infected with bird flu in the U.S. have had mild infections. The risk to the general public remains low, though livestock workers are at heightened risk, officials have said.\n\nOf the 61 identified people infected with bird flu across the U.S., more than half have been in California, CDC data shows.\n\nOnly one of the U.S. cases, a child in the San Francisco Bay Area, has had no connection to a dairy or poultry farm. State officials said the child had only mild symptoms of cold and flu.\n\nThe state’s 33 remaining cases have been in dairy workers. Their symptoms have typically been limited to eye redness and mild respiratory symptoms, and they soon recovered.\n\nOfficials and experts worry about the potential for the virus to mix with the seasonal flu, which could lead it to become more transmissible or severe. The CDC has sought to vaccinate livestock workers against seasonal flu to prevent this.\n\nWhy isn't more being done to contain bird flu?\n\nDespite quarantines of farms, outbreaks continue to occur, which suggests other routes of transmission, Payne, of UC Davis, said in an email.\n\nThese may include potential spread from wildlife such as rodents or birds living on or near farms. Additionally, flying insects and even dust plumes in the wind may are being studied, Payne said. \"As a whole, we still have a lot more to learn about the multiple ways the (bird flu) virus is being spread through our domestic species,\" he said.\n\nIn December, the USDA announced it would begin bulk testing of milk supplies to track the virus.\n\nGiven the rapid spread in California dairies, Raudabaugh said the U.S. needs to pursue a vaccine development “Operation Warp Speed” for cows, on par with the one during the Trump administration that rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines for people.\n\nBird flu “has been so catastrophic for our herds,” Raudabaugh said. “We have to do something really drastic in order to prevent this. Relying on herd immunity is not a good strategy.”\n\nOn Oct. 24, the Department of Health and Human Services announced USDA had started safety trials for vaccines in cows. While research into the vaccines is promising, it's still early, USDA told USA TODAY over email.\n\nFor people, the federal government has stockpiled 10 million doses of vaccine that it believes will be effective against the current strain of bird flu, though because of the mildness of illnesses so far and lack of human-to-human spread, it has not yet made the shots available to farmworkers or the general public.\n\n\"We can’t get either cattle or human vaccines on the market fast enough,\" Payne said.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/04/03/2024-bird-flu-outbreak-what-to-know/73189473007/", "title": "Bird flu outbreak: Questions abound amid 'evolving situation'", "text": "Many Americans are brimming with questions after officials in Texas last week announced the state's first case of bird flu in a human.\n\nOn April 1, Texas health officials said a person became infected with bird flu, or avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, after close contact with infected cows. The week prior, sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said.\n\nThe only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update April 1 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOfficials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves.\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"\n\nBut if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans.\n\nCDC says cases rising:What to know about meningococcal disease\n\nHow does bird flu spread?\n\nBird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.\n\nAvian flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, or mouth or inhale it into their lungs.\n\nPeople who have close contact or unprotected contact for long periods are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that leads to death.\n\nIn the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nOfficials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. The other species caught the virus directly from wild birds: cats.\n\nCornell researchers believe the virus was transmitted to Texas dairy cows through contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology.\n\nIn early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in the testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHow do humans get bird flu?\n\nIt's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease.\n\nThere remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases, officials said.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy:Weight-loss drugs cost $1,000 a month but less than $25 to make. Why do we pay so much?\n\nDo eggs carry bird flu? What about dairy products?\n\nFood production officials have been taking steps to prevent the distribution of milk or eggs from infected animals. Cooked eggs and pasteurized milk, in general, should be safe for consumers.\n\nLast week, the largest U.S. chicken egg supplier reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nThere isn't as simple of a solution to reduce the risk of bird flu since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell.\n\nAmong dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have microorganisms dangerous to human health.\n\nDr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian, said it’s important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, whereas this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren’t getting as sick.\n\nShe said people are at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with intensive dairy production.\n\nThe spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms.\n\n“If that’s the worst we see, then that’s good,” she said. “But we don’t yet know.\"\n\nHow can bird flu be stopped?\n\nThe latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nDetwiler believes consumers should be proactive if they have concerns about outbreaks.\n\n\"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\"\n\nOther ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. This includes contact with animal feces, waste, or materials contaminated by animals suspected or confirmed with bird flu.\n\nPeople working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment such as face masks – ideally approved particulate respirators such as N95 masks, as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. Additionally, they should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head covers or hair covers.\n\nPeople who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 10 days after the exposure.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.\n\nThe bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry.

People contract the virus when it gets into a their eyes, nose or mouth, or when it is inhaled.\n\nThose who contract the virus often experience mild illnesses including an eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms or no symptoms at all, while others can develop a severe sometimes fatal disease like pneumonia.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

An inmate in Colorado contracted the flu after exposure while working at a poultry farm.\n\nStill, public health officials say the risk of transmission in the general public is low.\n\nBird flu's economic impact:Worst bird flu in years drives up egg prices, prompts precautions against spread to humans\n\nWhat is the bird flu?\n\nThe bird flu, also known as the avian flu, refers to the disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted between birds.\n\nThe dominant virus strain circulating currently is called H5N1. It is extremely contagious among birds, who spread it by shedding the virus in their saliva, feces and through nasal secretions. The virus originates in wild birds, but can spread to domesticated birds and lead to rapid, massive outbreaks.\n\nAvian influenza viruses are classified into two groups: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).\n\nLPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high death rates in infected birds, according to the CDC.\n\nBird Flu symptoms in humans\n\nWhile possible, avian flu virus infections in humans are considered rare. The human infection reported in Colorado is only the second confirmed human infection of the present outbreak in the world.\n\nThe first confirmed infection was reported in December in a United Kingdom man who had ducks living inside his home. He presented no symptoms.\n\nThe man infected in Colorado showed mild symptoms of fatigue and was given antiviral medication for treatment. In China, officials confirmed the infection of a 4-year-old boy with a different strain, H3N8, after he reported a fever. Chinese health officials said his close contacts tested negative and that the strain posed little threat of wide spread.\n\nBird flu symptoms have been reported to be largely the same as the seasonal flu.\n\nSymptoms can include cough, a sore throat, head and muscle aches, fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\nSevere infections can lead to pneumonia that requires hospitalizations. Sometimes infection can cause a fever. Less common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nEarlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that 863 H5N1 cases have been confirmed globally in 18 countries since 2003, causing 455 deaths.\n\nBut the H5N1 virus in circulation now is different from prior versions, the CDC said, and the risk posed by bird flu to the public's health is still low.\n\nHuman to human transmission is rare.\n\n“Even when people have been infected with bird flu viruses there has rarely been onward spread from one infected person to another person,” the CDC website reads.\n\nMost people who become infected become so after “close, prolonged and unprotected contact with infected birds.”\n\nBird Flu prevention\n\nThe best personal bird flu prevention is steering clear of prolonged exposure to birds. For those who work in close contact with poultry, hunt, or keep birds of their own, the CDC recommends implementing extra precautions like wearing gloves, mask and eye protection.\n\nCoronavirus watch:Stay safe and informed with updates on the spread of the coronavirus\n\nAnimal migration:Climate change pushing animals to migrate, increasing risks of new pandemics, study finds", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/03/18/coronavirus-timeline-first-case-michigan-first-death/5069676002/", "title": "Coronavirus timeline: From the first case to Michigan's first death", "text": "In just a few weeks, the all-too-familiar coronavirus outbreak, which is causing the deadly COVID-19 illness and wrecking the world's economy, is quickly spreading across America — and now Michigan.\n\nHere's a timeline of how the pandemic has unfolded:\n\nMonday: Harris English tests positive for COVID-19 ahead of Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit.\n\nSunday: Michigan health officials urge caution as the state opens and coronavirus cases rise.

A cluster of infections would mark a significant expansion of the avian influenza virus, indicating that it could transmit from person to person.\n\nOn Friday, Missouri and federal health officials stressed there is no current evidence of human-to-human transmission. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nMichael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he sees no cause for concern unless or until any of those tests comes back positive.\n\n\"At this point we don’t have any evidence that this one case in Missouri has transmitted the virus to anyone,\" said Osterholm, an epidemiologist. \"I’m not saying it couldn’t have happened, but based on what we know so far, we’ve not had ongoing transmission. There’s no crisis.\"\n\nThis time of year, Osterholm said, roughly 2% of Americans have respiratory symptoms, which could be H5N1 or COVID-19 or simply a cold. The blood and DNA test results will tell the story, not symptoms.\n\n\"Just because somebody has symptoms of respiratory illness doesn’t tell me anything about 'is it likely or not likely to be flu,'\" he said. \"At this point, we want to be careful not to become alarmist.\"\n\nSo far this year, 14 people across the U.S. have been infected with H5N1 avian influenza. All but the Missouri person was infected after coming into close contact with poultry or dairy cows known to be infected.\n\nOfficials don't know how that person became infected with H5N1. Their infection was first reported Sept. 6.\n\nEarlier this month, federal health officials had first said the person hospitalized was likely an isolated case that didn’t appear to pose additional risk.\n\nSoon after, Missouri officials identified that a person in the same household developed “similar symptoms” on the same day as the confirmed case, according to Lisa Cox, communications director for the state Department of Health and Senior Services. But neither person had typical “flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis,” Cox said in an email, referring to symptoms seen in the prior bird flu cases across the U.S. this year.\n\nThe timing of the onset suggested common exposure, such as from a wild bird, rather than person-to-person transmission, she added. Another person reported limited contact with the infected patient, but that person reported no symptoms either before or after the visit.\n\nOn Friday, CDC said state officials identified 18 health care workers who had higher risk exposure. Three of those workers reported reported mild respiratory symptoms.\n\nOne person tested negative for influenza A, which includes bird flu. The other two weren’t clinically tested because they passed the 10-day follow-up period when those test results could be connected with a previous exposure, Cox said. Their symptoms also weren’t severe enough for them to seek medical testing.\n\nInstead, those two health workers have provided blood samples for CDC to test for H5N1 antibodies, which show up at least three weeks after symptoms have passed.\n\nBlood samples have been collected from five health care workers, Cox said. The original person and their household contact have already had their samples sent to the CDC. The five workers’ samples are set to be sent to CDC’s laboratory in Atlanta for testing. However, the remnants of Hurricane Helene passing through the American South are delaying shipment of the specimens, Cox said.\n\n“This type of testing is an additional diagnostic test that H5 infection has occurred in the person,” she said. “However, among other limitations, it will not be able to determine either the source or timing of any infection that may have occurred.”\n\nSeeing the results of the tests will be crucial, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infection diseases specialist at Georgetown University.\n\n\"We don’t know yet if any of these other people do have H5 influenza or did get it − that’s really important to investigate,\" he said.\n\nGoodman added public health workers should be more aggressive about testing people with mild or no symptoms, because it's not clear exactly how H5N1 manifests in people. \"It needs to be pursued aggressively,\" he said.\n\nHe also said there should be more widespread testing for H5N1, because he expects more people likely have it than have been discovered. The case in Missouri was caught purely by chance, because the person's flu was tested, which doesn't always happen. When it came back as an unusual type, it was sent for further testing, which also is atypical, Goodman said.\n\n\"We can’t view this with panic, but we need to view this as a warning shot and we need to lean forward with our surveillance and our preparedness,\" he said. \"Most public health threats, people overblow them.

Two cases of the virus appearing in people have been reported despite ongoing testing, said the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and their symptoms were relieved by simple over-the-counter flu medication.\n\nCommercial farming facilities have taken to destroying infected flocks in an attempt to quell the ongoing spread.

Since 2022, about 22.9 million birds from backyard flocks and commercial facilities have been destroyed to keep the virus at bay in Iowa, the nation's top egg producer, according to USDA data.\n\nBird flu infection found in alpacas for first time\n\nBesides the unusual spread to dairy cows in recent months, bird flu has been detected in other animals, including barn cats that were found dead at infected facilities. And now it's been found in alpacas.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories said Tuesday that a group of alpacas tested positive on May 16 on a farm in Idaho where poultry had previously tested positive and been destroyed.\n\nThis is the first known infection in alpacas, said the USDA.\n\nBird flu testing:Farmworkers face high-risk exposures to bird flu, but testing isn’t reaching them\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nBird flu, or avian flu, is a contagious infection that spreads among wild birds and can infect domestic poultry and other animal species. The virus does not often spread to humans but sporadic infections have been reported. There are several strains all belonging to influenza A-type viruses.\n\nThe most common subtypes that may affect humans are A (H5N1), A (H7N9) and A (H9N2), according to the Cleveland Clinic. In humans, symptoms can resemble a typical flu but may advance into more serious respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn birds, avian flu is highly contagious and cases can range in severity from mild to highly deadly. Infected birds shed the viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces, meaning other birds can contract the virus through contact with those fluids directly or via contact with a contaminated surface.\n\nThe CDC has documented two cases of human bird flu infections in 2024, one in a Michigan dairy farm worker and one in a dairy farm worker from Texas. Both infected people showed only symptoms of conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nBird flu virus outbreak in dairy cows\n\nThe current multi-state outbreak of bird flu in cattle likely began late last year.\n\nAt least 67 dairy cattle herds in nine states have been confirmed infected in nine states, including Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota.\n\nIn late April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that dairy product testing had found remnants of the virus in one out of five commercial dairy samples but none that contained a live virus capable of transmitting the disease.\n\nAs long as people consume pasteurized dairy products and cook poultry products to a proper temperature, mass-produced products continue to be safe, the agency said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/07/16/bird-flu-outbreak-colorado-update/74427629007/", "title": "Bird flu outbreak among Colorado poultry workers doubles US cases", "text": "Triple-digit temperatures, industrial fans and carts used to kill millions of sick chickens with gas may have caused the largest bird flu outbreak among U.S. workers to date, federal health officials said.\n\nA commercial egg-laying facility in northeast Colorado now has four workers confirmed infected with bird flu and another presumed to have contracted the virus, pending test results. The sickened Colorado workers, announced over the weekend, doubled the number of human cases in the U.S. since agricultural workers began contracting bird flu this year, first from dairy cows.\n\nWorkers at the poultry farm in Weld County had been in the process of killing 1.8 million chickens, some of which were infected with the dangerous H5N1 influenza, to prevent it from spreading, federal officials said in a briefing with reporters Tuesday.\n\nTheir goggles or N95 face masks apparently slipped as industrial fans blew feathers and other infected items through the sweltering barn, exposing them to the virus, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe workers all suffered some combination of fever, chills, coughing and eye infections, Shah said. They were given the antiviral Tamiflu, and none required hospitalization.\n\nThe virus' risk to the general public remains low, Shah said. The workers' illnesses were relatively mild, he said, and Tamiflu remains effective. Also, the genetic sequence of the virus has not changed substantially since December as the virus moved from Texas to a dozen other states, including Colorado ‒ and from birds to cows and then, apparently, back to chickens, as well as people.\n\n\"We've not seen severe illness, which is reassuring,\" Shah said. \"The other thing we look at, in addition to severity is whether the virus is able to transmit from animals to humans and/or from humans to humans with greater ease or with greater efficiency. We haven't seen changes, particularly on the human-to-human side.\"\n\nThe unfolding route of transmission\n\nOfficials said they don't know for sure how the H5N1 virus arrived at the Weld County poultry farm. In early July, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster emergency after the outbreak at the facility, the largest flock of chickens affected in the state and among the largest across the U.S.\n\nDays earlier, a dairy worker, also in northeastern Colorado, contracted bird flu, the state’s first case, while working with infected cows.\n\nCattle in the same region of Colorado had been known to be infected with the specific variant of the virus, so it's likely, though not yet confirmed, that the virus was passed from cattle to chickens, said Dr. Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s H5N1 Response.\n\n\"Poultry are very susceptible and easily infected,\" Deeble said on the call with reporters. \"It does not take much in order to introduce this into a flock.\"\n\nOnce any poultry on a farm are infected with H5N1, the only way to contain the virus is to kill the entire flock, the USDA has said. Killing all 1.8 million chickens could take up to two weeks, Deeble said.\n\nSweltering barns, feathers flying\n\nAbout 160 workers inside barns at the facility were tasked with pulling out chickens, placing several at a time in a cart that would then be filled with carbon dioxide, killing them in less than a minute and a half, Dr. Julie Gauthier, the USDA's executive director for field operations in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said on the call.\n\nTemperatures in northeast Colorado have hit 104 degrees, though Shah said temperatures inside the barns were even hotter. Workers wore light paper protective suits over their clothes, N95 respirators, goggles, boots and gloves. Industrial fans pushed air through the barns.\n\nThe fans made it uncomfortable to wear PPE, all while feathers ‒ a means in which bird flu virus can spread ‒ blew around. That probably caused the infections in five workers, officials said.\n\nThat suggests risks can be better controlled in the future with more systematic use of PPE, in addition to measures to improve ventilation, Shah said. A 10-person CDC team, which includes bilingual speakers and an industrial hygienist, arrived Saturday in Colorado to monitor and test workers and suggest safety improvements.\n\nIn total, 60 workers were tested for bird flu, and 55 tested negative, though many had symptoms consistent with other respiratory illnesses like rhinovirus, Shah said.\n\nSixteen workers who are symptomatic had been tested Monday, AnneMarie Harper, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email. Testing is still being done, and Shah said more infections might come to light.\n\nWhat preparedness looks like\n\nPart of the virus found on its surface remained unchanged from the first person infected in Texas to the first infected in Michigan and the workers sickened recently in Colorado, Shah said, suggesting the virus has not mutated to become more worrisome.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response is pushing ahead with production of millions of bird flu vaccine doses through July as part of a pre-pandemic stockpile, said David Boucher, director of the agency's infectious disease preparedness and response.\n\nThere is no recommendation yet for people to receive the vaccine, which has not been fully tested or approved for use.\n\nThe agency also distributed 5,000 goggles, 300,000 gloves, 150,000 N95 masks and 528 courses of Tamiflu to Colorado, Boucher said.\n\n\"This is what preparedness looks like,\" Shah said. \"It's making sure they have adequate stocks and supplies in the event that they may need them rather than trying to scurry and scramble at the last minute to acquire them.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/02/13/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-equatorial-guinea/11250717002/", "title": "Marburg virus: Disease outbreak confirmed by WHO: What to know", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nDAKAR, Senegal – The World Health Organization says that Equatorial Guinea has confirmed its first-ever outbreak of Marburg disease, saying the Ebola-related virus is responsible for at least nine deaths in the tiny Western African country.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the U.N. health agency confirmed the epidemic after samples from Equatorial Guinea were sent to a lab in Senegal to pinpoint the cause of disease after an alert from a local health official last week.\n\nThe WHO said there were currently nine deaths and 16 suspected cases with symptoms including fever, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting.

What to expect in legal ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court threw TikTok a potential lifeline on Wednesday when it agreed to quickly hear the company’s challenge to a law requiring it be sold or face a ban in the U.S. next month.\n\nBut the short-form video app and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, still have the tough task of convincing the Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court’s decision that national security concerns outweigh the law’s infringement of free speech rights.\n\n“This is the sort of government regulation of speech that the First Amendment is intended to prevent,” said Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. “But this is the set of facts and circumstances where the court is most likely to nonetheless allow that regulation.”\n\nOpponents of the law say the lower court gave too much deference to the federal government’s national security concerns and not enough consideration of freedom of expression when upholding the law.\n\n“We usually look to courts to stand up to the government when it infringes on the constitutional rights of millions of Americans, and I'm not sure the D.C. Circuit did that here,” said George Wang, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute.\n\nTikTok users are also looking to President-elect Donald Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to “save TikTok.”\n\nBut it’s unclear how he could do so.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 10. This is an expedited schedule because TikTok is up against the law’s Jan. 19 divesture deadline.\n\nTikTok had asked the court to put the deadline on hold while the justices consider the case, or to at least give 13 days' notice that the deadline is firm, which would allow app stores and internet host providers time to comply if the app can no longer be used in the U.S.\n\nInstead, the court deferred a decision on whether to pause the deadline until after the oral arguments.\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court deciding?\n\nThe issue is whether the law Congress passed this year with wide bipartisan support violates the First Amendment. If it does, a majority of justices have to be convinced that the law achieves an important government goal that can’t be addressed in other ways.\n\nThat goal is to prevent China from gathering data on Americans or manipulating the content on TikTok to shape U.S. opinion. About four in ten young adults in the U.S. regularly get news from the app, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nTikTok proposed ways of addressing the government’s concern without a sale.\n\nBut the Biden administration concluded that some data of U.S. users would still flow to China and ByteDance would still be able to exert control over TikTok’s operations in the U.S. The administration also didn’t trust that ByteDance would comply in good faith and didn’t think the U.S. could adequately monitor compliance.\n\nHow did the lower court rule?\n\nIn upholding the law, two of the three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit who heard the case said the statute was “carefully crafted” and is part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by China.\n\n“The Government provides persuasive support for its concerns regarding the threat posed by the PRC in general and through the TikTok platform in particular,” wrote Judge Douglas Ginsburg in an opinion joined by Judge Neomi Rao.\n\nBoth judges were appointed by Republican presidents – Ginsburg by Ronald Reagan and Rao by Trump.\n\nThe third judge – Sri Srinivasan, who was appointed by Democrat Barack Obama – agreed the law should be upheld but wrote a separate opinion.\n\nThat agreement across ideological lines among a respected trio of judges doesn’t bode well for TikTok’s chances at the Supreme Court.\n\nStill, Mary-Rose Papandrea, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said the appeals court’s opinion was “somewhat remarkable in the dramatic amount of deference” given to the government’s national security argument.\n\n“So much on TikTok has nothing to do with China or Taiwan or any other geopolitical issue and has to do more with ridiculous products and cat videos and all sorts of things where I don't see much of any real danger,” she said during a recent discussion of the case on a podcast co-hosted by Lawfare and New York University’s Center on Technology Policy. “Like, `Oh, I'm going to watch too many cat videos?’”\n\nWhat will the Supreme Court do?\n\nLeslie Garfield Tenzer, a professor at Pace University Law School, said the outcome is difficult to predict, in part, because of TikTok’s huge reach.\n\n“It’s become so ingrained in our economy with content providers and selling things,” she said, “that it really will shut down a sector.”\n\nBut other experts think the national security concerns that persuaded the appeals court are likely to resonate with the justices, even though the government presented no evidence that China is misusing the app.\n\n“If you're TikTok, you're going to say, `Look, there's no smoking gun here,’ which is true,” Alan Rozenshtein, associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School said during the podcast discussion. “And if you're the government, you can say, `OK, well, there's no smoking gun, but there's a gun. It's on the table. It's loaded. It's pointed at us. And we know that the shooter has shot the gun in other circumstances. So do you want us to wait?’”\n\nRozenshtein said he’s very doubtful that the court will save TikTok, leaving Trump as a last option.\n\nWill TikTok be banned?Donald Trump says he has a 'warm spot' for app as it faces January deadline\n\nCan Trump 'save' TikTok?\n\nThe most straightforward way for Trump to thwart the law is to get Congress to repeal it, a tall order.\n\nOnce Trump takes office − the day after the Jan. 19 deadline − he could also try to take advantage of ambiguity in the law about whether the president can declare that TikTok is no longer controlled by a Chinese entity, according to Rozenshtein.\n\n“So it's possible, that if Trump wants to help TikTok, he will get ByteDance to shuffle some papers around, sell some assets from here to there,” Rozenshtein said. “And then say that gives them enough legal cover to just announce that a divestiture has happened.”\n\nTrump could also direct his attorney general not to enforce the law. The problem with that is whether Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app will feel that’s enough protection.\n\n“I don’t think that the companies would be willing to take that risk,” Hurwitz said. “The penalties in this law are nontrivial.”\n\nWhat about TikTok's users?\n\nCritics of the law complain that the appeals court barely addressed the First Amendment rights of TikTok users in speaking, sharing and receiving information on the platform.\n\n“The free speech implications of the coming ban on TikTok in the United States are staggering and unprecedented,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley Law School recently wrote in an opinion piece arguing the Supreme Court should strike down the law.\n\nAbout one-third of Americans supported the government banning TikTok in a Pew Research Center survey conducted this summer. Twenty-eight percent opposed a ban and 39% were unsure.\n\nEven if TikTok is taken over by another owner so it can remain in operation, free speech advocates argue that’s not good enough.\n\nDivestiture “would inevitably alter the platform, the user experience, and the community of users,” the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Knight First Amendment Institute told the Supreme Court.\n\n“It's just not true that all social media platforms are sort of fungible, that they all provide the same things, and they all have the same communities,” said Wang of the Knight First Amendment Institute. “The idea that removing a platform’s owner somehow doesn’t have implications for free speech I think woefully misunderstands how social media platforms work.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/business/tiktok-search-engine-misinformation/index.html", "title": "TikTok's search engine repeatedly delivers misinformation to its ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen a TikTok user searches the social media app for information on top news stories, ranging from Covid-19 vaccines to school shootings, nearly 20% of the videos presented as search results contain misinformation, according to a research report published Wednesday.\n\nResearchers at NewsGuard, a journalism and technology tool that tracks online information, searched TikTok and Google this month for information on major news topics such as the 2020 presidential election, the Russia-Ukraine war and abortion to compare the misinfomation delivered by their search engines.\n\nTikTok, whose users are predominantly teenagers and young adults, “repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results, often within the first five,” the report states. “Google, by comparison, provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results, with far less misinformation.”\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNN.\n\nThe researchers searched terms such as “mRNA vaccine” and “2022 election,” as well as controversial news topics like “Uvalde tx conspiracy.” They analyzed 540 TikTok results and found that 105 videos, or 19.4%, contained false or misleading claims, the report says.\n\nAccording to the report, a search on TikTok for information about politics, including the 2020 presidential election and the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection, often included misinformation as well as references to QAnon conspiracy theories. For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia. But this takes it so many levels further.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/tech/social-media-lawsuits-teen-suicide/index.html", "title": "Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive?Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/23/tiktok-possible-ban-congress/11513920002/", "title": "A US TikTok ban is gaining support in Congress.

Several bills introduced recently could ban Americans from using the app.\n\nBut First Amendment advocates say such bans could run counter to a basic principle of American democracy: free speech.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nA First Amendment right to use TikTok, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, \"has, I think, not received the kind of attention that it deserves.”\n\nTikTok has vocally opposed proposals to ban the app in the U.S., where the company claims it has 150 million active users.\n\nBrooke Oberwetter, a TikTok spokesperson, told USA TODAY that an American ban on TikTok would amount to a \"ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.\"\n\nBowman is the most prominent lawmaker to speak out against a ban. He was joined at a press conference Wednesday by Reps. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., and Robert Garcia, D-Calif., who said they supported the message.\n\nBowman said at the press conference he's in favor of privacy and security reforms for social media, but not at the expense of creative expression.\n\n\"But we have to uplift freedom of speech and the creativity that so many content creators are bringing to the American people,\" he said.\n\nFirst Amendment issues\n\nThe First Amendment protects freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or any American's right to speak freely, among other rights.\n\nJames Lewis, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' strategic technologies program, told USA TODAY that restricting TikTok content could be construed as censorship.\n\n“It seems a little silly to say that a bunch of lip-synching 15-year-olds are protected speech, but it's protected speech,\" Lewis said.\n\nBoth the American Civil Liberties Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression have urged against a TikTok ban, suggesting the move would raise serious First Amendment concerns and almost certainly face legal action.\n\n\"(A TikTok ban) is going to prevent people across the country from expressing themselves, from communicating with people, from artistic expression within political expression,\" Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, told USA TODAY. \"And that is in violation of their First Amendment right to free speech.”\n\nContent creators express concern\n\nOf course, TikTok has grown beyond the singing and dancing that fueled its rise in popularity. A few swipes on the app's For You page could yield educational demonstrations, deeply personal testimonies and oddly edited clips that make little sense to those outside the platform's influence, each interacted with by millions of viewers.\n\n\"(TikTok) allows you to express yourself in a very particular way,\" Bowman said. \"To threaten a ban, or to ban, or to give the president the power to ban (the app), you're banning a platform used by 150 million Americans who all operate under the First Amendment, which gives us the freedom to speak.\"\n\nBut not all the app's content is innocuous. The misinformation watchdog NewsGuard said in a September report that TikTok's search results are often riddled with misinformation, finding that nearly 1 in 5 of the videos automatically suggested by the platform when searching major news topics contained misinformation.\n\nTikTok creators at Wednesday's press conference urged Congress to consider the impact a ban could have on American users.\n\nCallie Goodwin launched her greeting card company, Sparks of Joy Co., on TikTok during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 with the goal of spreading happiness during a time of sadness and isolation, she said. Since then, she said she has sold more than 35,000 cards — and 95% of those orders came from TikTok.\n\n\"A TikTok ban wouldn't just put my business at risk; 95% of my livelihood would disappear overnight, along with this entire community of creators and customers that I have built over the platform,\" she said.\n\nFor Tiffany Yu, a disability advocate whose arm was paralyzed more than 25 years ago as the result of a car accident, TikTok has been a \"game changer,\" allowing her to reach new audiences with her cause.\n\n\"A ban takes away the connections we've built, silencing communities that continue to be underrepresented and not given a voice,\" she said.\n\nThe case for a ban\n\nBut many lawmakers and others say the app endangers national security.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray testified in December the agency was concerned about Chinese officials controlling the app’s algorithm and argued the app could be used \"to collect data through it on users which can be used for traditional espionage operations.\"\n\nWhen announcing bipartisan legislation that would allow the commerce secretary to ban TikTok, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said that China can't be trusted with American data.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party has proven over the last few years that it is willing to lie about just about everything,\" Thune said, introducing the bill alongside Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. \"That likely won't end with TikTok, which is why it's important to establish a holistic and methodical approach to the challenges that are posed by technology from foreign adversaries.\"\n\nThe Biden administration, which has signaled support for Warner and Thune's bill, banned the app from all government-issued devices, as well.\n\nTikTok singled out\n\nBowman urged Congress to question why TikTok is the only platform being scrutinized by Congress while most agree that all social media causes some harm.\n\n\"We're isolating TikTok and singling them out,\" Bowman said in the interview. \"And they are no worse or better than any of the other social media platforms who have committed blatant, egregious violations in terms of impact on our society and democracy.\"\n\nBowman pointed to the Russia's interference in the 2016 election via Facebook, and the mis- and disinformation on all social media platforms that led to the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack.\n\n\"It's a larger conversation that we have here, and singling out TikTok moves us away from that conversation,\" he said.\n\nThe platform's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, is testifying Thursday in Congress, where he will likely face aggressive questioning from lawmakers on the app's ties to China and handling of private user data.\n\nIn Chew's prepared testimony, he says TikTok plans to firewall protected U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access, reject manipulation by any government to remain \"a platform for free expression\" and give access to third-party independent monitors for accountability. He also says the app will continue to prioritize safety for its users, particularly teens.\n\nThe legal experts interviewed by USA TODAY agreed that a privacy law addressing data collection would more effectively address the national security concerns raised by lawmakers than a ban while still protecting First Amendment rights.\n\nIn his interview with USA TODAY, Bowman indicated support for data privacy legislation and said his office is \"looking at legislation related to the safety and security risk of all social media, and preventing the harm that it causes.\" But the lawmaker's decision to speak out has less to do with future legislation and more to do with encouraging \"broad, nuanced conversations about social media,\" he said.\n\n\"Banning TikTok isn't going to stop the harm that happens in all of social media,\" he said.\n\nDig deeper:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957187/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-28-june-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 28 June 2022 | The Week", "text": "1.

If the measure ultimately gets approved, ByteDance will have six months to sell off TikTok or face a ban in the U.S.\n\nTo see how your reps voted, click on the state name to go directly to the state or scroll through the list below.\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming\n\nMary Pelota (D-1): YEA\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester (D-1): YEA\n\nRuss Fulcher (R-1): YEA\n\nMike Simpson (R-2): Not voting\n\nKelly Armstrong (N.D.-1): YEA\n\nDusty Johnson (R-1): YEA\n\nBecca Balint (D-1): YEA", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/business/twitter-musk-trump-reinstate/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk restores Donald Trump's Twitter account | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account has been reinstated on the platform.\n\nThe account, which Twitter banned following the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, was restored after Twitter CEO and new owner Elon Musk posted a poll on Twitter on Friday night asking the platform’s users if Trump should be reinstated.\n\n“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted Saturday night. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of God.”\n\nThe final poll results on Saturday night showed 51.8% in favor and 48.2% opposed. The poll included 15 million votes.\n\nThe much-anticipated decision from the new owner sets the stage for the former president’s return to the social media platform, where he was previously its most influential, if controversial, user. With almost 90 million followers, his tweets often moved the markets, set the news cycle and drove the agenda in Washington.\n\nTrump has previously said he would remain on his platform, Truth Social, instead of rejoining Twitter, but a change in his approach could hold major political implications. The former president announced this month that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, aiming to become only the second commander in chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\n\nAsked on Saturday what he thought of Musk purchasing Twitter and his own future on the platform, Trump praised Musk but questioned whether the site would survive its current crises.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Trump said about possibly returning to Twitter 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\n“They have a lot of problems,” Trump said in Las Vegas at the Republican Jewish Coalition meeting. “You see what’s going on. It may make it, it may not make it.”\n\nStill, Trump said he liked Musk and “liked that he bought (Twitter.)”\n\n“He’s a character and I tend to like characters,” the former president said of Musk. “But he’s smart.”\n\nThroughout Trump’s White House tenure, Twitter was central to his presidency, a fact that also benefited the company in the form of countless hours of user engagement. Twitter often took a light-touch approach to moderating his account, arguing at times that as a public official, the then-president must be given wide latitude to speak.\n\nBut as Trump neared the end of his term – and increasingly tweeted misinformation alleging election fraud – the balance shifted. The company began applying warning labels to his tweets in an attempt to correct his misleading claims ahead of the 2020 presidential election. And following the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, the platform banned him indefinitely.\n\n“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said at the time. “In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.”\n\nThe decision followed two tweets by Trump that, according to Twitter, violated the company’s policy against glorification of violence. The tweets, Twitter said at the time, “must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks.”\n\nThe first tweet – a statement about Trump’s supporters, who he called “75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me” – suggested that “he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election,” Twitter had said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump's dilemma: Truth Social or Twitter? 05:11 - Source: CNN\n\nThe second, which indicated he did not plan to attend Joe Biden’s inauguration, could be viewed as a further statement that the election was not legitimate and could be interpreted as Trump saying that the inauguration would be a “safe” target for violence because he would not be attending, according to Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk’s decision, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming suggested on Twitter that “it’s a good time to watch” a public hearing held earlier this year by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\n“It covers each of Trump’s tweets that day, including those that have been deleted, and features multiple Trump (White House) staff describing his inexcusable conduct during the violence,” Cheney, a notable Trump critic who serves on the select committee, tweeted Saturday.\n\nSoon after Trump’s Twitter ban, he was also restricted from Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, which could also restore his accounts as soon as January 2023.\n\nOn November 18, Musk tweeted that he had reinstated several controversial accounts on the platform, but that a “Trump decision has not yet been made.”\n\n“New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,” he said at the time. “Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.”\n\nMusk had previously said he disagreed with Twitter’s permanent ban policy and could also return other accounts that had been removed from the platform for repeated rules violations.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump; I think that was a mistake,” Musk said at a conference in May, pledging to reverse the ban were he to become the company’s owner.\n\nJack Dorsey, who was the CEO of Twitter when the company banned Trump but has since left, responded to Musk’s comments saying he agreed that there should not be permanent bans. Banning the former president, he said, was a “business decision” and it “shouldn’t have been.”\n\nThe Trump decision is the latest in a series of major changes Musk has made at Twitter, including pushing out its top leadership and a significant portion of its staff.\n\nMusk also launched an updated subscription service allowing users to pay to receive verification checkmarks, an indicator previously reserved for authenticated public figures, which was quickly abused and used to impersonate prominent people, businesses and government agencies. Twitter paused the service and plans to reinstate it later this month.\n\nAnd on Friday, he said he would restore the accounts of three controversial, previously banned or suspended users: Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee and comedian Kathy Griffin.\n\nThe chaos has scared off many of Twitter’s major advertisers, who are wary of having their ads run alongside potentially objectionable content, threatening the company’s core business model. Macy’s, Volkswagen Group, General Mills and other large brands have all paused advertising, causing what Musk called earlier this month “a massive drop in revenue.” And restoring Trump to the platform is unlikely to help.\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson called on advertisers still funding Twitter to immediately stop all ad buys.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Will Twitter advertiser dollars affect Musk's promise to Trump? 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\n“In Elon Musk’s Twittersphere, you can incite an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which led to the deaths of multiple people, and still be allowed to spew hate speech and violent conspiracies on his platform,” Johnson said in a statement. “If Elon Musk continues to run Twitter like this, using garbage polls that do not represent the American people and the needs of our democracy, God help us all.”\n\nIn an apparent effort to reassure advertisers and users, Musk previously said he would implement a “content moderation council” to help set policies, and that no major content moderation decisions would be made before it was in place. There is no indication that such a group was involved in the move to restore Trump nor the other users who were returned to the platform on Friday.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the New York Times Friday, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety Yoel Roth, who left the company last week, said that despite the billionaire’s promises to involve others in key decisions, “Mr. Musk has made clear that at the end of the day, he’ll be the one calling the shots.”\n\nAny surge in traffic on Twitter due to Trump’s reinstatement could also put a technical strain on the platform that would coincide with the World Cup, which is typically one of the biggest audience events on the site.\n\n“Twitter servers being out [put] through quite the stress test by @elonmusk right now,” Sriram Krishnan, an investor who is assisting as part of Musk’s Twitter leadership team, tweeted Saturday night.\n\nMass worker exits at the company had prompted users, as well as some employees, to question whether the platform could face outages or other issues. Already, Twitter has experienced some glitches in recent days, including with its feature that allows users to download their data from the site.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Paul Leblanc", "Clare Duffy", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/18/los-angeles-school-district-cellphone-social-media-ban/74144479007/", "title": "Los Angeles school district approves cellphone and social media ban", "text": "Over 429,000 students in the nation’s second-largest school district will be prohibited from using cellphones and social media platforms during the school day after the Los Angeles Unified School District board passed the ban Tuesday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District's Board of Education voted 5-2, approving a resolution to develop within 120 days a policy that bans student use of cellphones and social media platforms during the entire school day. The policy, which will be implemented districtwide, will go into effect by January, according to the board.\n\n\"I think we're going to be on the vanguard here, and students and this entire city and country are going to benefit as a result,\" said board member Nick Melvoin, who proposed the resolution.\n\nThe move is an attempt by educators to curb classroom distractions and protect students' mental health. K-12 teachers in the U.S. have increasingly faced challenges over students' cellphone use with one-third saying phone distraction is a \"major problem in their classroom,\" according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in fall 2023.\n\nOn Tuesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed his support for efforts to restrict cellphone use in schools across the state. Newsom previously signed legislation in 2019 that allowed, but did not require, districts to limit or ban smartphone use at schools.\n\nGoing old school:Flip phone sales are surging as folks seek connection without distraction\n\nThe governor echoed U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy's remarks published Monday in a New York Times opinion essay. Murthy called for safety warning labels – similar to those on tobacco and alcohol products – on social media platforms, citing what he considers a mental health \"emergency\" among young people.\n\n\"As the Surgeon General affirmed, social media is harming the mental health of our youth,\" Newsom said in a statement Tuesday. \"Building on legislation I signed in 2019, I look forward to working with the Legislature to restrict the use of smartphones during the school day. When children and teens are in school, they should be focused on their studies – not their screens.\"\n\nFive reasons kids are missing school.Chronic absenteeism is schools' 'biggest problem.'\n\n'Full-time job being the police of the phone'\n\nThe Los Angeles ban will expand on its existing policy that prohibits \"the use of cellular phones, pagers, or any electronic signaling device by students on campus during normal school hours or school activities, excluding the students’ lunchtime or nutrition breaks.\" The current policy was adopted in 2011.\n\nFor the updated policy, the Los Angeles Unified School District board said school officials will have to consider options for cellphone storage, such as locked pouches or lockers during school hours. Officials will also need to consider age and grade-level appropriate guidelines, along with what exceptions should be made for students with learning or physical disabilities.\n\nThe ban has received mixed reactions from school administrators, parents, and students who have noted concerns over student ownership, safety, and communication, and enforcing the policy on a wide scale, The Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nBoard member George McKenna voted against the resolution and cited concerns that the policy would be too restrictive. Board member Scott Schmerelson also voted against the resolution saying it was unclear whether the ban would be implemented during noninstructional time and questioned who would enforce the policy.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a full-time job being the police of the phone,\" Schmerelson said.\n\nSupporters of the ban said a similar policy at a district middle school has improved the campus' learning environment, according to The Times.\n\nBoard members supporting the ban wrote in their agenda that research \"indicates that limiting cellphone usage and social media access during the school day increases academic performance and has positive effects on student mental health.\" They added that research has shown a correlation between cellphone addiction and increased rates of anxiety and cyberbullying.\n\nSchool cellphone bans in other states, schools\n\nParents and educators across the country have expressed growing concern over the impact of cellphones on young people, including classroom distractions and potential mental health issues. As of the 2021-2022 school year, more than 76% of K-12 public schools prohibit cellphone use in non-academic settings, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nBut in recent years, lawmakers have considered legislation restricting smartphone use in schools. Last year, Florida became the first state to prohibit student phone use during class time and to block student access to social media on school Wi-Fi.\n\nIn March, Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a bill prohibiting students from using phones and other wireless devices in classrooms. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a similar bill in May that requires school districts to establish a policy governing cellphone usage during school hours.\n\nAs of June, lawmakers in at least eight states have considered passing similar legislation, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nContributing: Sara Chernikoff and Kinsey Crowley, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/09/harris-trump-presidential-debate-watching-guide/75019078007/", "title": "Harris-Trump debate: 7 things to watch for at high stakes faceoff", "text": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be a major test – and opportunity – in a presidential campaign that has already been defined by a debate.\n\nDemocrats and their progressive allies are fully aware of the stakes after the last head-to-head showdown led to weeks of internal party turmoil culminating in 81-year-old President Joe Biden's dramatic exit from the race.\n\nMany are eager for Harris, known for her resume and reputation as a prosecutor, to take her Republican opponent to task over his unprecedented criminal record and to draw a contrast on critical issues facing the country in front of a national audience.\n\n\"What happened in June demonstrates just how important debates still are in a presidential election,\" said Christina Harvey, executive director of Stand Up America, a liberal-leaning voting rights group.\n\n\"It will be important because these two candidates have such a different promise and vision for America's future,\" she added.\n\nKeeping up with Election 2024? Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nFormer Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016, agreed that Tuesday's exchange will be \"critically important\" for both campaigns. But he said it will be far more telling how the Democratic nominee performs under the spotlight.\n\n\"My view is that people know almost nothing about Harris,\" Gilmore said of the incumbent 59-year-old vice president, who previously did run for the White House while serving as a senator from California. \"She is going to introduce herself in the debate for the very first time, nobody knows anything about this woman.\"\n\nHere's a look at what each candidate must emphasize and avoid – and how this debate has the power to sway voters.\n\nWith few undecided voters, 'everything matters'\n\nThe debate comes at a critical moment in a race that's going to come down to a sliver of voters.\n\nRoughly 90% of likely voters said their minds are \"firmly made up,\" according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll released this month. The survey found about 8% of respondents indicated they might change their mind with approximately 1% saying they are undecided.\n\n\"In a close election, everything matters,\" said Marc Trussler, director of data science at the University of Pennsylvania's program on opinion research and election studies.\n\nDebates don't typically move the needle among partisans, who are the most likely audience to watch Tuesday's broadcast. But even a small number of voters who are skeptical of both candidates might find reasons to choose differently based on this conversation.\n\n\"So there's a little bit of persuasion,\" Trussler said. \"Even more so, it's going to be them talking to their bases and trying to build that enthusiasm to vote, something that has been lacking for the Democratic campaign, but has been gaining steadily since Harris has taken over as the nominee.\"\n\n'Can I call you, Joe?': How Harris and Trump interact\n\nThe debate rules are the same as they were in June: no live audience, no props and (over the Harris campaign’s objections) muted microphones when the other candidate is speaking.\n\nBut rather than a rematch between two candidates who had tussled for more than four years, this is now an eight-week sprint between two people who've never met in-person. Harris and Trump didn't interact during his State of the Union addresses as president, and he didn't attend her inauguration as VP after refusing to accept the 2020 election results.\n\nRepublican consultant Liz Mair, a former spokeswoman for John McCain's 2008 campaign, said the two having no previous interactions could play a role. She said the last time a national debate of this magnitude took place with two candidates who genuinely did not know each other was when then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin faced off against then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden while both were running for vice president.\n\nAt the start of that debate in St. Louis, Palin asked: \"Can I call you, Joe?\" due largely to fumbling his last name throughout her previous preparations. \"And that did make a big difference,\" Mair told USA TODAY.\n\nPolitical observers will dissect every second of how the two interact in the first few minutes, including how they respond to each other's attacks and the moderators.\n\nMair said she has guided GOP candidates through debates, and will be watching how Trump responds to Harris, who is the second woman to be a major party's nominee for president after Hillary Clinton led the Democratic ticket in the 2016 race against Trump.\n\n\"It's very difficult for male candidates to come off as forceful and authoritative without coming off as being sexist, patronizing (and) condescending,\" she said. \"I think the fact that they haven't met before probably makes that worse.\"\n\nEnding the Harris honeymoon without offending is Trump's test\n\nTrump and his team have an obvious mission: pop Harris' rising balloon without turning off swing voters who have as many concerns about the former president's character as his policy pursuits.\n\nIn the past, the GOP nominee has been known to bring surprise guests to debates and come up with creative insults, but Trump's allies warn against those sort of antics. Instead, he is being urged to focus on the issues that animate conservatives and calling attention to her liberal views rather than vitriolic personal attacks and other ad hominem tangents.\n\n\"If Trump stays on the issues, stays on message – and that's by the way can include criticizing Harris for being a flip flopper – that's OK,\" Gilmore said. \"But he needs to then say, 'We don't know what she's going to do, but this is what I'm going to do.' If he talks about the issues, he's going to be fine.\"\n\nThe trouble is Trump isn't always the most disciplined messenger, and often rambles or revels in slinging personal attacks, which have included questioning Harris' racial heritage. At an August event in Asheboro, North Carolina, Trump said people often advise him to be nicer but, \"sometimes it’s hard when you're attacked from all ends.\"\n\nHarris faces danger in debate too, experts warn\n\nFor some, the televised debate is more perilous for Harris, who is still introducing herself to a large segment of the country who don't fully grasp what she stands for or will do if elected president.\n\nThe VP has reportedly been working on ways to get under Trump's skin by highlighting his repeated false statements while looking for a viral social media moment that could define the race.\n\nBut debate experts warn Harris, who remains a relative blank page to voters compared with her Republican rival, faces a steeper fall should a misstep occur that could halt the momentum her campaign has built over several weeks.\n\n\"The risk for her is that she's still not that well known to a large portion of the American public, and so it is possible she has a weak performance that she undermines the hope that she's brought to Democrats,\" said Robert Rowland, a communication studies professor at the University of Kansas.\n\nHarris has done one sit-down interview, joined by running mate Tim Walz, since winning the Democratic nomination. She has been criticized for giving just a handful of policy-focused speeches on the campaign trail and independent voters in particular will be looking for more details.\n\nHarris could be tripped up by Trump or the moderators on why she's changed positions on a number of issues, specifically hydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, which is a big issue in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2019, Harris called for a fracking ban when running for president but told CNN she believes climate change can be tackled without a prohibition on the oil extraction practice.\n\nIt will be telling to see how much time Harris spends jousting with Trump versus speaking directly to voters about her plans and views.\n\n'Best decision I made': Biden's record will be as central as the issues\n\nPresident Biden won't be at this debate, but he's likely to come up for very different reasons Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans will want to tag Harris as the true incumbent and anchor her to every controversial decision or bad outcome over the past four years.\n\nTrump has been relentless, for example, in bringing up the botched 2021 evacuation ending the war in Afghanistan that resulted in 13 U.S. troops being killed. He has posted videos online of those soldiers' relatives who specifically blame Harris for the outcome.\n\nIn other ads, the Trump campaign calls attention to higher grocery costs with clips of her saying, \"Bidenomics is working.\" That, along with Harris' role in dealing with root causes for the crisis at the southern border and what she knew about Biden's capacity, could all be used against the vice president during Tuesday's debate.\n\nOnly 31% of Americans surveyed in the USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll said the country is on the right track versus to 58% who said it is on the wrong track.\n\nAs Harris threads the incumbency needle, she might look to defend her boss, who is seeing better numbers since bowing out.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk survey found that about 84% of voters think his decision to drop out was right, and 48% of respondents approve of the job he's doing compared to 41% who said the same in late June.\n\nOther pollsters show Biden's numbers relatively unchanged, but as Democrats and their allies revere the president's choice, any improvement benefits Harris.\n\n\"I think that Harris needs to run against Trump, not Biden ... who accomplished a significant amount during his presidency,\" said Harvey, the voting rights leader.\n\nHarvey said instead of playing defense Harris can go on offense Tuesday by reminding voters about the series of controversies and decisions made during the Trump years. She noted how the next president could make multiple appointments to the Supreme Court in the next term.\n\nFour of the nine justices will be in their 70s by the end of next January, which progressive activists say raises the stakes given the high court's 6-3 conservative tilt.\n\n\"They could retire or die or have health issues,\" Harvey said. \"That means that if Trump were reelected, he can ensure MAGA control of the court for decades to come. That would have a huge impact on issues concerning abortion, voting rights and on gun safety.\"\n\n'Prosecutor v. felon' (or reality TV star)\n\nOne thing that infuriated Democrats about the June 27 debate was Biden’s missed opportunity at making a coherent case against Trump on national TV.\n\nWhether it is the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, handling of the COVID-19 pandemic or his various court cases, Harris comes into Tuesday with an expectation by supporters to put Trump's political and personal record on trial.\n\nThe Harris campaign enjoys framing this race as a “prosecutor v. felon.” But a debate stage isn't a courtroom and Trump, a former reality TV star, is experienced in what will be his seventh presidential debate when counting his past White House campaigns in 2016 and 2020.\n\nDebate could break audience records\n\nBiden’s exit, Harris’ entry and Trump's showmanship has given this campaign a cinematic feel that coupled with real world consequences, could make it the most watched presidential debate in U.S. history.\n\nThat title is currently held by the 2016 contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton, who drew about 84 million viewers during their first debate.\n\nThe other top watched debates are roughly 80 million who watched the 1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter; and approximately 73 million who viewed the first 2020 debate between Biden and Trump amid the pandemic.\n\nABC News will host the event, but if you include other platforms and streaming services this could break records.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/23/juul-ban-jan-6-hearings-title-ix-planets-aligning-thursdays-news/7711842001/", "title": "Juul ban, Jan. 6 hearings, Title IX, planets aligning.

It was the example he set on and off screen to help ensure he wasn’t the only one. Or the last.\n\nGene Seymour Jeremy Freeman/CNN\n\nPoitier, whose death at 94 was announced Friday, lived long enough not only to reap full and proper acclaim for his groundbreaking body of work as a film actor, but to also witness wave after wave of Black actors, actresses, writers, directors and craftspeople following the path he helped clear for them to win their own Hollywood niches – and their own Oscars to go along with the one he historically won for lead actor for 1963’s “Lilies of the Field.”\n\nAs far as other Black male film stars are concerned, let’s put it as simply, and starkly, as possible: Without Sir Sidney Poitier, there is no Billy Dee Williams, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Forest Whitaker, Michael B. Jordan or, for that matter, that other Michael Jordan, whose ability to parlay his fearsome basketball skills into a cross-cultural, multi-media hyphenate was at least partly enabled by Poitier, who made it safe for Black culture heroes in all kinds of endeavors to connect with Whites as well as other Blacks.\n\nSidney Poiter in the movie \"A Raisin in the Sun\" in 1961. George Rinhart/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, when you consider Black male presence in cinema before Poitier’s movie debut in 1950’s “No Way Out” up to a present day – with Black actors as diverse as Washington, Whitaker, Jordan, Delroy Lindo, Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, LaKeith Stanfield, Leslie Odom Jr, Brian Tyree Henry, Anthony Mackie, Daniel Kaluuya and Aldis Hodge appearing in comparably diverse screen roles – the full measure of what Poitier managed to achieve, practically by himself, is, saying the least, awe-inspiring.\n\nIn a postwar America moving steadily, if warily, away from racial segregation, Poitier fulfilled Black movie audiences’ desire for an articulate, youthful and physically magnetic embodiment of their aspirations. He did so while appealing to White audiences for those same qualities – along with a disarming reserve, replete with wry mischief and just enough mystery to keep them guessing what lay beneath his cool, dry exterior.\n\nHis stardom emerged from Eisenhower-era “social problem pictures” like “Blackboard Jungle” (1955), “Edge of the City” (1957) and “The Defiant Ones” (1958), where his role as a chain-gang escapee handcuffed to Tony Curtis’s bigoted White convict garnered his first Oscar nomination. With the 1961 adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s play “A Raisin in the Sun,” where he reprised the role of put-upon family man Walter Younger that he created in the stage version, Poitier established himself as the most identifiable African-American leading actor in movies.\n\nAs he was testing the breadth of his mass appeal and, as film historian Donald Bogle writes, giving “Black Americans a significant reason for going to the movies,” Poitier was aware that he was also testing the levels of racial tolerance. Most of his roles from the 1950s through the 1960s, befitting an era shaped by Brown v. Board of Education and the civil rights movement, were linked by varying tensions between his Black characters and Whites’ reactions to them.\n\nIn 1962’s “Pressure Point,” for instance, Poitier’s prison psychiatrist is compelled to check his anger while treating Bobby Darin’s flamboyantly vicious crypto-Nazi convict. In 1965’s “A Patch of Blue,” he was Gordon, a warm-hearted Black man who shows kindness to a poor and blind White girl (Elizabeth Hartman), whose growing love for him is shortchanged, at the end, by him.\n\nThis came three years after the role that won Poitier the Oscar for Best Actor (many, including Bogle, believe he should have won for “Raisin”) for “Lilies of the Field,” in which he played a jovial, if world-weary, ex-soldier who runs into a group of refugee German nuns in the Arizona desert in need of their own chapel. Considered light and fluffy even when it premiered in 1963, the movie nonetheless charmed viewers, and Poitier’s charisma and skills were as dominating as ever. Yet almost as many contemporary audiences wince at what they now see as a paradigmatic, anachronistic exemplar of what is now referred to as the “magical negro” movie, in which Black characters’ only real purpose is to carry out near-miraculous salvation for White characters.\n\nPoitier was aware of the tightrope history had asked him to walk: having to widen the possibilities for both his career and his fellow Black performers and maintain his dignity and artistry without alienating Whites in the perilous years of the civil rights era. He was intent on finding roles where race, as such, didn’t matter to the plot, like 1965’s “The Bedford Incident,” or expanded the masses’ expectations for Black actors, as in 1966’s “Duel at Diablo.”\n\nHis greatest year, in terms of visibility, was 1967, which yielded the trifecta box-office triumphs of “To Sir, With Love,” “In the Heat of the Night” and “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner,” a romantic comedy about an impending interracial marriage where, in the role of a too-good-to-be-true doctor in the running for a Nobel Prize, he achieved apotheosis as a paragon of virtue who Americans at large would have to be insane to lock out of their living rooms. Yet once again, Poitier’s command of the screen and his delicate radar for nuance kept the saccharine from overpowering the enterprise.\n\nSidney Poitier and Rod Steiger on the set of \"In the Heat of the Night\" in 1967. United Artists/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nIronically, as Poitier reached this career peak, his image was under siege by increasing militancy among African American audiences and critics who believed the movement toward racial integration had been overpowered by imperatives for Black nationalism. The late Clifford Mason, a Black cultural critic, wrote a scathing piece for the New York Times that year, “Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?” which, while acknowledging Poitier’s heroic efforts to break down Hollywood’s once-impregnable race barriers and giving him props for being allowed to slap back at a White southern aristocrat in “In the Heat of the Night,” insisted that Poitier has over 20 years, “play[ed] essentially the same role, the antiseptic, one-dimensional hero.”\n\nMore than 50 years have passed and, saying the least, you don’t hear such things being said about Poitier or his oeuvre. That’s partly because Poitier, instead of retreating from or reacting badly to such criticism, continued to broaden both his movie image and his professional palate, giving Black audiences a romantic comedy of their own with 1968’s “For Love of Ivy,” playing a militant revolutionary in 1969’s “The Lost Man,” and directing his own movies, notably with a tandem of comedies written by award-winning playwright Richard Wesley, 1974’s “Uptown Saturday Night” and 1975’s “Let’s Do It Again,” which became “crossover” hits in their amiable depictions of working class Black life.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAfter his last film in 2001, nearly-75-year-old Poitier was given another Oscar for lifetime achievement. He had reached the kind of iconic stature once reserved solely for such male icons as John Wayne, James Cagney and Cary Grant. That same night, Poitier got to watch both Denzel Washington and Halle Berry receive lead acting Academy Awards, with Berry being the first Black actress to receive the award.\n\nYou can’t say for certain, but you have to believe that Poitier believed those latter two events represented a greater, more significant recognition of his long quest for acceptance and achievement than another gold statuette.", "authors": ["Gene Seymour"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/12/14/montgomery-alabama-jeff-davis-high-school-band-leaders-real-story/4398855002/", "title": "Vanilla Funk: Jefferson Davis drum major Justin Heideman faces the ...", "text": "MONTGOMERY, ALA. – It’s dusk and just outside the windows of Room 107 at Jefferson Davis High School in Montgomery, Alabama, the final remnants of the band are leaving practice the same way they came: blaring and filling the now chilled crisp of the December air with the powerful and royal tones of brass.\n\nJustin Heideman, better known as “Vanilla Funk” or “that boy John,” shifts his position in his chair and postures up from a slouch, clutching the ever so familiar mace drum majors wield. There is a calm intensity that covers him as if he is still in front of his band – as if he’s still in control.\n\nThat’s because he is.\n\nHeideman raises his hand, as if to say, “Hold on one second,” reaches for his iPhone and dials the number of his band director Brandon Howard.\n\n“Can you tell the guys outside to be quiet? They are interrupting what’s going on in here.”\n\nHe hangs up, slouches back, tilts his head toward the tiled ceiling and takes a breath before moving his fingers through his hair against the grain. Now, back in his position of comfort, Heideman focuses in; it’s time for another interview.\n\nThis is his life now, but he hasn’t changed a bit, despite the few who misunderstand who he is and what it took for him to be in the position he is in now.\n\nThis isn’t a game for Heideman. It never has been.\n\nMusic is his passion, and before he went viral in October, a white boy leading an all-black band, Heideman carried out his job as head drum major the same way he does now: with discipline, fervor, an intense desire to learn at all costs and a dedication to uphold the legacy of Jeff Davis drum majors who came before him.\n\nBut, Heideman’s existence is not and was not about clicks, laughs, followers or being invited to the proverbial “cookout.” It’s about being a Jefferson Davis “Intermission Magician” from his first breath to his last, and he’ll stand for that in the face of prejudice and those suggesting he’s a talentless token who doesn’t belong.\n\n“They say it’s ‘white mediocrity,’” Heideman said. “I don’t care if I’m white, I don’t care if I’m Asian, Hispanic, black, whatever. I don’t care if I’m in the front, in the back, 5 miles behind ... mediocrity is not the word.\n\n“I don’t care if you call me white. You can call me white all day, you can call me a cracker, but as soon as you call me ‘mediocre,’ don’t come after my craft, because I have worked tirelessly to perfect this craft.”\n\nBroken Pledge:The fraternity hazing and death of Ohio University freshman Collin Wiant\n\nA viral video changed his life\n\nOct. 5, 2019, was the day Heideman’s life changed forever.\n\nIt was Saturday, the day after JD’s band conducted its annual homecoming parade around the school, when social media personality @PubbyLongway released a video commentary of Heideman leading the JD band.\n\nIt went viral.\n\n“The first thing that I thought was, ‘This is hilarious! He’s talking about us!’” Heideman said, without realizing how popular @PubbyLongway was. “When I looked at his profile, he was really popular on social media. I was like, ‘He’s actually really famous on social media; this might go viral!’”\n\nBy the end of the weekend, the video had amassed hundreds of thousands of views on Instagram and Twitter, each.\n\nHeideman’s fellow drum majors, Xavier “Cruise Control” Jackson, Dominic “D-Willy” Williams, and Jaylon “Freak Nasty” Jones, said they had the same reaction.\n\nJackson and Williams reached out to Heideman as soon as they saw the video picking up steam, but he played it cool, Jackson said.\n\n“I saw the video, and I busted out laughing, that’s all I could do,” Jackson said. “Then I went to Justin and said ‘Justin, did you see this video? and he said ‘Yea, I been seen it.’ And I’m looking like, ‘How did you feel about it?’”\n\nHeideman’s response: “I just busted out laughing, I can’t feel no way.” There was a collective feeling of disbelief, Jones said. The group didn’t expect it to “blow up” and when it did, it became “surreal.”\n\nWhen the four got to school on Monday they were met with praises and the most popular lines of the video’s commentary, ‘Slideee, to the Sky!’ and ‘Where that boy John at?’ Williams said.\n\nHeideman was a celebrity.\n\nThe viral nature of the video was exciting, but Howard, the band's director of nine years, said he was afraid his band would be viewed as a joke, among other things. He was concerned about the image of the band and protecting his kids from the horrors of the comment section online – an intuition that became a reality.\n\n“When I saw it, of course it was pretty funny,” Howard said. “But when I was watching the video I was like ‘Man, how are you all going to catch this video?’ This was probably the worst video that I wanted put out there of my group.”\n\nThere were a lot of variables to consider for Howard: His band wasn’t completely dressed, as it was a minor parade JD does every year for homecoming where they march from the school to the elementary school across the street and back; Heideman had a ponytail at the top of his head, put in by his girlfriend, Jenilyn Davis, as a joke, “that no one would notice,\" according to Jackson; and the focus of the video was placed solely on Heideman.\n\n“It’s funny to put them on display like that,” Howard said. “But I don’t want my band to turn into a joke. I don’t want him (Heideman) to turn into a joke.”\n\nThat wasn’t the intention of Pubby Longway’s post. He said he was impressed and that Heideman deserved the attention. However, Longway didn’t account for the seeds of hate that would sprout in response. No one really did.\n\nLongway stumbled across the initial video of Heideman performing, while browsing on Facebook. He said he was thoroughly impressed because had never seen a white drum major lead an all-black band.\n\n“I was just chilling, and I had videos just running,” Longway said. “Next thing you know I left the room, and I heard some band stuff playing, and I like band music, because I was in band myself. So, I said, ‘Let me go back and listen to that.’ I ran back to my room and I saw Justin. I was like ‘What!? It’s a white boy leading the pack.’”\n\nThat was enough for Longway to record one of his famous voice-overs, and the internet took care of the rest. Longway said he expected to get a little more views than he usually does, “50K maybe 100K,\" he said, because of the unique nature of the content.\n\nIt blew up beyond expectations, and today the video sits at 4.4 million views.\n\nEven with the praise and positive social engagement, hate, ignorance, and prejudice countered with a punch of its own.\n\nI'm Sorry!!!..

(Stephen Herron, YouTube)\n\nA slice of the African American community saw Heideman’s lead as a crime. Comments poured in on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and other online forums incriminating Heideman of not being worthy to lead the band.\n\n“They don’t know the full story behind that, you can’t just go off what you see,” Jackson said. “I feel like people are saying that because he's the first person you see and then you got us behind him. No, it should all just be about that one band, because it’s one band.”\n\nOthers suggested there was something heinous about a group of black children following the lead of a white boy and expressed that Heideman took the attention away from the three other drum majors:\n\nYa’ll (sic) the reason we can’t get ahead as people!!! Do not share or praise this fellow ALL THE WHILE IGNORING THE BLACK DRUM MAJORS DOING JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER! I have nothing against him personally but stop praising white mediocrity. (username: tsugraytiger, hbcusports.com forum)\n\n“I saw all the slander,” Longway said. “I even got some slander off of that, because it’s a lot of people that are real pro-black now, and they were like ‘Yea, you’re just helping another white dude get on. He’s just on your back and he gonna ride ya.’ And I saw Justin was getting the lash of a white boy being in that position, while black people been doing it for so long and he’s getting recognition off of it like it’s just something brand new.\"\n\nHowever, “I don’t even think it phased him really,” Longway said.\n\nThat wasn’t the case, the words cut deeper than Heideman let off.\n\nHoward said Heideman ultimately came to him considering quitting, all the while letting on that he was fine. Howard wasn’t having that. Thus, Heideman told Howard if quitting was “too far of a step,” then let's shake up the formation. “Put Xavier in the front, Dom can take his spot, Jalen can take (Dom’s) spot, and I’ll sit in the back, since everybody wants to talk about how I don’t deserve to be in the front.”\n\nThe public backlash from a select group of people was an “eye-opener” for Heideman, Howard said. “He didn’t realize people would approach it that way. But a high school kid, really? This kid is 17 years old, he didn’t ask for this.”\n\nThose commenting saw their words as a protection of the culture – a culture that African Americans fight to preserve daily. Yet many did not give Heideman the benefit of the doubt. Rather, he was viewed as an invader, someone that encroached on a piece of black culture that they weren’t willing to surrender as so many other things.\n\nIn many ways, the opposition that Heideman faced is an age-old story blacks have been up against for years when attempting to enter a space not everyone agreed they belonged in.\n\n“I just feel like he’s in our shoes a little bit, like in a black person’s world,” Longway said. “You know how black people try to get into a sport or something new like hockey or something? Or anything like polo, you know you’re the first black to do something? In high school, I’ve never seen a white drum major do anything like that.\"\n\nWhat’s not understood by some onlookers is Heideman’s journey and the work he put in to achieve this status, as alluded to by Longway. Some have not taken a look beyond the viral nature of the video, or the idea of Justin as just another white person trying to be cool. But the ones closest to Heideman say it’s beyond that.\n\nIt’s about the band and functionality thereof. It’s about Heideman earning his spot just like every other drum major that came before.\n\n“They just think he just gets out there and just dances,” Williams said. “It’s bigger than that.”\n\nRace is not the whole story, they said though the viralization of Heideman’s existence made that his narrative.\n\n“When you get to looking on the internet, everybody is slandering him,” Williams said. “Saying, ‘What is he doing as a white head drum major leading a black band?’ To me, (his race) really doesn’t faze me, but as to see people talk about him, it’s stupid. Justin, all the things he went through, all the trials and tribulations that he took to become the person he is, a lot of people don’t see that side of him, because they just see him on the internet.”\n\nFor starters, Heideman has been the head drum major at JD the past two years, and America is late to the party.\n\nFurthermore, the process of becoming a drum major is a rigorous task. Howard takes those auditioning through a one- to two-month process of punctilious training before auditions start.\n\nThis process starts with about 15 individuals. Practices last hours and extend to the weekends, weeding out the unqualified. The number of participants dwindles with each week, and by audition time there are usually about four or five, “because everybody can’t really hang,” Howard said.\n\nOnce the audition gets underway, those remaining are graded on a 80-point scale by judges on stationary points (detailed body control and executing specific movements), conducting, facial and whistle commands and a small routine they must execute.\n\n“A lot of people think, ‘Oh, you pick your drum majors because they can dance,’” Howard said. “No, we pick them because they are meticulous in the way they do things.”\n\nOf those 80 points, the year Heideman auditioned, he scored a 78 out of 80. The highest score.\n\nEarning his keep: The birth of 'Vanilla Funk'\n\nUnlike most white children in Montgomery and the surrounding areas, Heideman attends one of the city's traditional public schools, instead of one of its magnet or private schools.\n\nDemographically, JD is roughly 91% black and 6% white, according to the Alabama Department of Education report card. So, Heideman was always going to stand out, but his parents didn't think this was an issue.\n\n\"His mother and I both went to public school here in Montgomery,\" Eric Heideman, Justin's father said. \"To this family, color is not an issue. We don't look at race. We look at the quality of the person.\"\n\nHeideman was hesitant about many things his freshman year, which included joining the band. It all was foreign to him.\n\nHeideman attended the first practice but didn’t return at the request of his parents who wanted him to spend the first semester of school focusing on his grades.\n\nWhen he got his shot to join again in the spring, Heideman was still unsure.\n\n“I didn’t know what to expect,” Heideman said, “didn’t know anything about the SWAC or HBCU show style-bands.”\n\nHis hesitancy quickly turned into love, and Heideman made the decision to give all that he had to band: “back-breaking work,” he described it. Nonetheless, there were still some obstacles to be scaled and questions to be answered.\n\nOne of those questions was posed by fellow drum major Jackson and trombonist at the time: “Is he going to be able to keep up? Will he be able to do this how we do this? I wasn’t quick to judge, I gave him a shot,” Jackson said. “I just couldn’t seem to wrap my head around him.”\n\nHowever, Jackson and others soon found the character ultimately unearthed was of an individual who wants to be the best, learn as much as he can, and yearns to lead. Heideman pursues those things unrelentingly, and he meticulously studies his craft.\n\n“He might be one of the most passionate kids I’ve had here at Jeff Davis,” Howard said. “From the time he stepped foot in the door, he was excited about playing his (trumpet). He wanted to be the best player. Then he noticed the drum majors, and he wanted to be the best leader.”\n\nBy the summer of 2016 that's what Heideman set his sights on.\n\n“It was instinctively inside of me saying, ‘If you work hard maybe others will see it, and try to outdo you, and then you can try to outdo them. Iron sharpens iron. So, then I worked harder and harder, and I told myself, ‘I want to be drum major.’”\n\nHe’d only been with the band for a handful of months, but he wasn’t shy about declaring his interest in leading.\n\n“He would come in here every day saying, ‘Mr. Howard, let me show you what I learned,’” Howard said. “Then he would show me a drum major routine that he tried to put together. Everything was kind of shaky, but you could tell he was really driven to get it done.”\n\nHeideman spent hours in his room studying styles and marching sequences. He’d watch videos of HBCU drum majors from around the country, emulating what he saw. Everything was trial and error, he said.\n\nHe mixed styles together, tried moves that didn’t necessarily go with one another. He blazed his own path in the confines of his home and laid the groundwork for the day he’d get his shot. He visualized it and made it a reality for himself in advance.\n\nHeideman remembers the first time he ever attempted to move like a show-style drum major. It was the summer of 2016, before his first band camp with JD. He walked outside into his backyard dressed for the occasion, shirt tucked into pants, the only thing missing was a whistle. “I wanted to dance like a drum major,” he said, “so, I marched like a drum major,” and he used his imagination to fill in the rest.\n\nHe could hear the music, he could see the crowd and the formation of the band he led. He felt his fellow drum majors behind him, and his backyard transformed into welcoming greens of a football field with a roaring sea of people cheering.\n\n“Growing up I always had an imagination,” Heideman said. “I imagined that I was the head drum major alongside whoever was there, and I marched in, and the band started playing and I started throwing some random stand that wasn’t even an actual drum major stand.\n\n“I thought it was actually good, and then I cut off and said, 'Yeaaa, I’m a drum major.'\"\n\nHe prepared for what he knew would come. He led the trumpet section, Howard said, and emerged as one of the best trumpet players in the band.\n\n“(He) marched through the entire year headed toward that drum major goal that he had already set,” Howard said.\n\nWhen the time for tryouts came around as he entered his third year, Heideman told people through the band that he was going to make head drum major.\n\nThey doubted him, not all but some, telling him flat out he couldn’t do it.\n\n“A lot of people thought he wasn’t going to make it because of his color,” Howard said, “and that was definitely something that would be a hindrance for most, but that wasn't for him.”\n\nEntering the audition Heideman competed for the four spots against four other people, including Jones and Jackson. It was muscle memory for Heideman and, “he knocked it out of the water,” Howard said.\n\nThe decision was made.\n\nHoward announced the names third to first, Heideman said, as they waited nervously.\n\nXavier Jackson.\n\n“OK ,OK, good job,” Heideman said to himself.\n\nChris Watts.\n\n“OK ,OK, good job. Either I didn’t make it or I’m head drum major,” Heideman said.\n\nJustin Heideman.\n\nJones said that when they announced Heideman’s name as the head drum major, Heideman was “calm and chill” about it. Jones said they all knew it was going to be him because of how strong he performed, but Heideman’s reaction, though he was excited and in disbelief, was that of a fulfilled expectation.\n\nNow, it was time to lead.\n\nThe news of Heideman’s appointment spread across the band’s Facebook page and left many in shock, including Williams.\n\n“When I saw that, I was like, ‘Wow,’” Williams said. “It was really shocking. It was not bad, I was just thinking of ‘How is it going to be now that we have a white head drum major,’ and how that was actually going to change things?”\n\nWilliams' question represented what a majority of people were thinking: “Will he be able to do his role and play his part? Will people accept him as a drum major and respect him?”\n\nThere was an unspoken sense that Heideman had to prove himself, despite his accomplishment. So, he led with a heavy hand, the trio of Williams, Jackson and Jones said.\n\n“Justin’s approach last year when he first made it was more so taking leadership,” Jones said, “because we all knew this was going to be a totally different squad, like a different group of drum majors, the band is going to try to run over him. So his thing was, ‘maybe if I come in with strong leadership, strong discipline, then they’ll follow me,'\" but that was not the case at all.\n\nThere were some members in the band that did not respect Heideman, Williams said, and he struggled with it at first, but ultimately, “He found ways to overcome that.”\n\n“It took a lot to gain respect,” Heideman said. “Even still I don’t think I’m done with gaining respect from people.”\n\nThough Heideman still has to prove himself, leading this band has become second nature to him. He doesn’t take offense to some of the resistance he’s seen and doesn’t see race as being the factor. He said leading this band, “is just like leading any other band.”\n\n“High school students are going to be high school students,” Heideman said. “Everybody has their own little personality, and the ones that aren’t really disciplined are going to stay undisciplined until you show them that you deserve respect. It’s only then, when they decide. ‘OK, I’ll listen.”\n\nHe’s been able to gain this respect through being a teacher, his peers said. If there is trouble or conflict he knows how to handle it now. If a band member is struggling with some of the music, he has a knack for explaining and breaking things down, bit by bit to them, his fellow drum majors said.\n\n“He earned his spot. He earned the fame. He earned all of that,” Williams said. “He’s been working so long to earn his spot, and he honestly did.”\n\nWhile some feel the black band experience is “for the culture” and protected by the culture, those close to Heideman insists he is not here to steal it. Rather, he has worked hard to be a part of it and lives to honor it. He’s an ally, not an invader.\n\n“Justin came to be a part of this, not to overtake it,” Williams said.\n\nJackson further explained: “We (the black band) keep marching on. I say that because back in the day we used to march for our freedom,\" Jackson said, \"and now today we have that freedom, but we’re still marching on. We’re showing that ‘Hey, it’s about culture now,’ and bringing the nation together as one.”\n\nThat's apropos since according to Heideman and Howard, Heideman is receiving interest from HBCUs and predominantly white institutions (PWIs): Jackson State, Auburn, Alabama State, Texas Southern, Kentucky State and Troy.\n\nThough Heideman said he prefers the HBCU show-style, he remains undeclared and says that it's his dream to introduce the two styles to one another.\n\n\"I'm just another person that happens to be a different race doing what other people have done,\" Heideman said. \"Yea, it's viral because nobody expected somebody like me to actually care about what people a part of this culture do.\"\n\nFollow Montgomery Advertiser reporter Andre Toran on Twitter @AndreToran.\n\nFlorida physical education teacher faces firing:Allegedly threatened to 'kill someone’\n\n'It comes down to pure greed':Insulin prices double, causing many people with diabetes to turn to extremes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2020/02/03/black-history-month-2020-kentuckys-african-american-history-makers/4623876002/", "title": "Black History Month 2020: Kentucky's African American history makers", "text": "Courier Journal\n\nEditor's Note: Each day during February, Black History Month, The Courier Journal is featuring African Americans who impacted Kentucky.

Nicknamed \"The Greatest,\" he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers of all time. Ali began boxing at age 12. As an amateur boxer, he won six Golden Gloves Tournaments in Kentucky and two National Golden Gloves Tournaments. In 1960, Ali won an Olympic gold medal in boxing, then made his professional boxing debut.\n\nBy 1964, Ali was the World Heavyweight Champion. He joined the Nation of Islam that same year. After refusing induction into the U.S. Army in 1967 for religious reasons, he was barred from boxing for three years. During that time, Ali toured colleges and universities addressing civil rights issues. In 1970, a U.S. Supreme Court decision ended his exile from boxing. In 1974 and again in 1978, he regained the World Heavyweight Champion title, making him the first boxer to have held the title three times.\n\nHis autobiography, \"The Greatest,\" was written in 1975. Other books published about Ali include: \"Muhammad Ali: The People's Champ,\" \"Muhammad Ali in Perspective\" and \"Healing, A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding.\"\n\nYou may like:Muhammad Ali gets the Ken Burns treatment in new film\n\nCharles Anderson Jr.\n\nCharles W. Anderson, Jr. (1907-1960), was Kentucky's first African American legislator in the South since Reconstruction. In 1935, after establishing a successful law practice in Louisville, Anderson ran as a Republican for the state legislature. He won and immediately began working to improve educational opportunities and better access to public facilities for Kentucky’s African Americans. Another major political achievement for Anderson was the repeal of Kentucky’s public hanging law.\n\nAnderson resigned his seat in 1946 to become the assistant commonwealth's attorney for the 30th Judicial District. Beginning in 1943, Anderson served two terms as the president of the National Negro Bar Association. In the 1950s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Anderson as an alternate delegate to the United Nations. He was also elected as the president of the Louisville NAACP.\n\nWhen Kentucky Governor Albert “Happy” Chandler provided Anderson with a Kentucky Colonel’s commission, he was the first black Kentuckian to receive that honor. Tragically, Anderson died in 1960 in an automobile/train accident in Shelbyville, Kentucky. However, his example led other African Americans to follow his footsteps and pursue elected public offices in an effort to improve the state for all of its citizens.\n\nSee also:Have black restaurants been left out of Louisville's food conversation?\n\nMary Ellen Britton\n\nMary Ellen Britton (1855–1925) was an African American physician, educator, suffragist, journalist and civil rights activist from Lexington. She attended Berea College, the first institution of higher learning in Kentucky to admit black students. The only profession open to educated women of any race at that time was teaching, and Britton taught in segregated public schools. Britton was an original member of the Kentucky Negro Education Association, which formed in 1877. She was president of the Lexington Woman's Improvement Club and later served as a charter member of the Ladies Orphan Society, which founded the Colored Orphan Industrial Home in Lexington in 1892.\n\nShe wrote commentaries opposing Jim Crow laws and then turned her attention to another problem afflicting her race, the lack of adequate health care. She enrolled in the American Missionary College in Chicago and graduated with a medical degree. In 1902, she became the first black woman in Lexington to be a licensed physician. Her specialties included hydrotherapy and electrotherapy, the use of water and electricity to treat illnesses and diseases. She treated patients in her home.\n\nDespite a busy medical practice, Britton remained active in civil rights and the growing women's rights movement. She retired in 1923 and died two years later at the age of 70.\n\nYou may like:How a Louisville woman helped shape city's civil rights movement\n\nWilla Brown Chappell\n\nWilla Brown Chappell (1906-1992) was born Willa Beatrice Brown in Glasgow, Kentucky. A pioneering aviator, she earned her pilot’s license in 1937, making her the first African American woman to be licensed in the United States. In 1941, she became the first African American officer in the Civil Air Patrol. The U.S. government also named her federal coordinator of the CAP Chicago unit. In 1943, she became the first woman in the United States who possessed both a mechanic’s license and a commercial license in aviation.\n\nInfluenced by the aviatrix Bessie Coleman, Willa started taking flying lessons in 1934. Soon she became a member of the Challenger Air Pilot’s Association and the Chicago Girls Flight Club. She also purchased her own airplane. Willa Brown co-founded the National Airmen’s Association of America in 1937, an organization designed to get African Americans into the United States Air Force.\n\nIn 1940, Brown and Lt. Cornelius R. Coffey started the Coffey School of Aeronautics, where approximately 200 pilots were trained in the next seven years. Some of those pilots later became part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee Institute. They were also known as the legendary “Tuskegee Airmen.” Her efforts were directly responsible for the squadron’s creation, which led to the integration of the military in 1948.\n\nCheck out:30+ events to help you celebrate Black History Month in Louisville\n\nAnna Mac Clarke\n\nAnna Mac Clarke (1919-1944) was a native of Lawrenceburg and a graduate of Kentucky State University. Clarke was the first black woman in Kentucky to enlist in the military during World War II and was a member of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corp, or WACC. Her educational and athletic backgrounds were ideally suited to enter WAAC Officer Candidate School. She attended officer training at the segregated Fort Des Moines military base. In February 1943, she was reassigned as third officer and became the first black WAAC assigned to command an all-white platoon.\n\nWhile stationed at Douglas Army Air Field in Arizona, she led the fight to desegregate the base theater. News of this incident reached the commanding officer of the air field, Col. Harvey Dyer, who proceeded to release a statement in February 1944 that ended segregation and discriminatory practices at the base. Shortly thereafter, Clarke died of a ruptured appendix at the base hospital in 1944.\n\nMarker No. 1970 in Anderson County notes the achievements of Clarke as a pioneer in military leadership and in ending segregation on military bases. A commemorative postage stamp is planned in her honor.\n\nCheck out:Louisville tea shop will be an LGBTQ space for black and sober people\n\nThe Rev. Louis Coleman Jr.\n\nThe Rev. Louis Coleman Jr. (1943-2008) was Louisville’s best-known social justice activist for more than three decades. Using the form of protest to bring about positive change, he picketed and prayed in front of nearly every major Kentucky institution to advance human rights and environmental justice. He was a staunch civil rights activist and a dedicated fighter against injustice as executive director of the Justice Resource Center, which he began in 1975.\n\nColeman’s passion for civil rights and equality was awakened at an early age as he witnessed his family endure the injustices of living within a segregated society. He was raised in the historic Smoketown neighborhood of Louisville. His mother, Dorothy Figg Coleman, and his father, Louis Henry Coleman Sr., along with Jackie Robinson, were his icons. He will be remembered carrying a bullhorn in hand, chanting 1960s-vintage activist anthems such as “We Shall Not Be Moved” along with committed followers who would protest across Kentucky.\n\nOne of Coleman’s major struggles was fighting against environmental racism. He publicly questioned the smokestack emissions in the Rubbertown area in Louisville, prompting state funding for air monitoring. The monitoring revealed excessive levels of chemicals in the air and resulted in a stringent toxic-air control program throughout Jefferson County.\n\nThe Courier Journal newspaper mentioned Coleman in 1,076 stories and letters in the 1990s alone.\n\nBlack History Month:One seat on every TARC bus in Louisville honors Rosa Parks\n\nNellie Conley\n\nNellie Conley (1873-1959), whose stage name was Madame Sul-Te-Wan, was a pioneering stage and film actor who became one of the most prominent black performers in Hollywood during the silent era, with a career that spanned more than seven decades. The Louisville native is best known as the first African American actor who in 1915 was contracted to appear in one of the most controversial films in American cinematic history, D. W. Griffith’s groundbreaking \"Birth of a Nation.\"\n\nConley's interest in performing was awakened when, as a young girl, she would deliver laundry to Louisville’s Buckingham Theater. There, the white female actors, who were her mother’s customers, often invited Conley to watch the shows. Quietly, she studied the entertainers: their dance steps, vocal mannerisms and routines. Conley would rehearse the act in front of classmates, vowing that she too would be an actor someday.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Madame Sul-Te-Wan would establish herself as a publicly recognizable character actress. Despite the motion picture industry’s limitations for African American performers, Conley worked consistently throughout the '30s and '40s. The successful actress once defended what some critics said were demeaning roles for African Americans: “I’d rather play a maid than be one,” she said.\n\nAlice Dunnigan\n\nAlice Dunnigan (1906-1983) was born in Russellville, Kentucky, in 1906. At age 14, she already had a weekly column in an Owensboro newspaper. Although she wanted to write, she began training at Kentucky State University to become a teacher and began teaching in Todd County in 1924. She continued writing and had articles published in the Louisville Defender and other local newspapers. She wrote stories on local African American families and their interests.\n\nIn 1942, she moved to Washington, D.C., and began working for the U.S. Department of Labor. She also became a reporter for The Associated Negro Press. Dunnigan became the first African American female to have a Capitol press pass and the first African American elected to the Women's National Press Club. In 1948, Dunnigan covered the presidential campaign of Harry Truman. In 1967, she was appointed to the President's Council on Youth Opportunity, where she worked until she retired in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, Dunnigan wrote the story of her life, \"A Black Woman's Experience — From Schoolhouse to White House.\" She authored another book in 1982, \"The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians,\" and was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame.\n\nDunnigan's efforts resulted in greater access for African American journalists in every level of government.\n\nMary Ann Fisher\n\nMary Ann Fisher (1923-2004) was born in Henderson, Kentucky. During her childhood, Fisher and some of her eight siblings were placed in the Kentucky Home Society for Colored Children in Louisville. Fisher was adopted after her first year at the orphanage. The orphanage was also home to Jonah Jones, Dicky Wells, and Helen Humes.\n\nHer musical career began in the 1940s when she entered talent contests at Louisville's old Lyric Theatre and the convention center, which later became Louisville Gardens. She won several contests, developed her act and was soon the headliner at the old Orchid Bar downtown. She was 32 and working as a dishwasher in 1955 when she met Ray Charles at the USO club at Fort Knox. She toured with him from 1955 until 1958.\n\nLater, she became a solo act and often performed in revues with such legends as B.B. King, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Percy Mayfield, Bobby Bland and many others. Her first album, \"Song Bird of the South,\" was not released until her death in 2004. She can also be heard on the albums \"Early Girls,\" \"v.4,\" \"What'd I Say,\" and \"Talk'n 'Bout You.\"\n\nLionel Hampton\n\nLionel Hampton (1908-2002) was raised by his mother in Louisville.

Hampton became a renowned jazz vibraphonist, pianist, percussionist and bandleader.\n\nHampton began his early career playing drums professionally while still a teenager living in Chicago. He moved to California, where he worked with Louis Armstrong, which launched Hampton’s career as a vibraphonist. Hampton performed with other jazz legends from Teddy Wilson, Benny Goodman and Buddy Rich to Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus and Quincy Jones, to name a few. Hampton’s resume of musical collaboration is endless. Benny Goodman invited Hampton to join his trio, which soon became the Benny Goodman Quartet, the first racially integrated jazz group to perform before audiences.\n\nIn New York, Hampton recorded with several different small groups known as Hampton's Orchestra, which developed a high profile during the 1940s and early 1950s. Since the '60s, the University of Idaho Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival has honored the music, dance and history of jazz and one of its most honored artists, Hampton. In 1968, Hampton received a Papal Medal from Pope Paul VI. In 1992, Lionel Hampton was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, and he was awarded National Medal of Arts in 1996.\n\nHelen Humes\n\nHelen Humes (1913–1981) was born in Louisville to Emma Johnson and John Henry Humes. She grew up as an only child. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father was the first black attorney in town. Humes started as a teenage jazz and blues singer, then a vocalist with Count Basie's band, and later became an R&B diva. Along with other well-known jazz singers of the swing era, Humes helped to shape and define the sound of vocal swing music.\n\nHer career began with her first vocal performance in an amateur contest, where her talents led to multiple album recording contracts. At the age of 14, Humes went to St. Louis and began recording albums singing the blues. She went on to New York, where she performed and became known all over the world. She toured Australia and performed at the Newport Jazz Festival and the Monterey Jazz Festival. She toured Europe with the first American Folk Blues Festival.\n\nCount Basie approached Humes while she was performing at the Cincinnati Cotton Club, an important venue in the city's music scene.

Humes eventually joined Count Basie's Orchestra and gained acclaim as a singer of ballads and popular songs, while she was also recognized as a talented blues singer.\n\nGrace Marilynn James\n\nGrace Marilynn James (1923–1989) was born in Charleston, West Virginia, to Edward L. James and Stella Grace Shaw James. She became a practicing pediatrician in Louisville when hospitals in the city were racially segregated by law. At the University of Louisville School of Medicine, she was the first African American physician on the faculty. She was also one of the first African American women on the faculty at any Southern medical school. Additionally, she was the first African American woman to serve as an attending physician at Louisville's Kosair Children's Hospital.\n\nJames attended West Virginia State College, and she completed postgraduate work at West Virginia State College and the University of Chicago. She graduated from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, with an M.D. James relocated to New York City and completed a pediatric residency at Harlem Hospital.

She worked for the Jefferson County Health Department and was a pediatrician for the West End Day Care Center. She was the first African American woman to be granted membership in the Jefferson County Medical Society.\n\nLyman T. Johnson\n\nLyman T. Johnson (1906-1997) was best known for breaking the racial barrier at the University of Kentucky, where, in 1949, he became the first African American to attend classes there.\n\nAs an educator at Central High School in Louisville for 33 years, he quickly became the most vocal public school teacher in denouncing discrimination and being involved in social justice and equity issues. Johnson fought to end unequal pay for African American teachers. He also served for nearly 10 years as an assistant principal and school board member in Jefferson County Public Schools. In addition, Johnson headed the Louisville chapter of the NAACP for six years.\n\nDuring the civil rights movement, Johnson piloted the struggle to integrate Jefferson County neighborhoods, swimming pools, schools and restaurants. Always a catalyst for change, he was a grassroots leader who commanded a lifelong fight for equality in educational opportunities.\n\nThere are fellowship programs named in his honor, and a dormitory was renamed Lyman T. Johnson Hall at the University of Kentucky. The Lyman T. Johnson Middle School, commonly known as Johnson Traditional Middle School, was named in his honor in 1980. A biography of Johnson titled \"The Rest of the Dream: The Black Odyssey of Lyman Johnson\" was published in 1988.\n\nAlberta Jones\n\nAlberta Odell Jones (1930-1965) was an attorney and civil rights icon. She was one of the first African American women to pass the Kentucky bar and the first woman appointed city attorney in Jefferson County. Jones’ life was tragically cut short at 34 years old in 1965.\n\nJones graduated from Louisville Central High School and went to the Louisville Municipal College for Negroes, graduating third in her class. She attended the University of Louisville School of Law for one year before transferring to Howard University School of Law for her degree. She began practicing law and represented Muhammad Ali. She was appointed in 1965 to the Louisville Domestic Relations Court, where she was a prosecutor. Just five months after becoming a prosecutor, Jones was abducted from her car, beaten and thrown off the Sherman Minton Bridge. No one was ever arrested for her murder.\n\nBefore her untimely death, Jones was active in the civil rights movement. She formed the Independent Voters Association of Louisville and was very involved with the Louisville chapter of the Urban League, as well as the NAACP.\n\nAn “Alberta’s Louisville” banner now hangs on the River City Bank building downtown at Sixth and Muhammad Ali as part of Louisville’s Hometown Heroes program.\n\nJonah Jones\n\nJonah Jones (1909-2000) was one of the most popular jazz trumpet players of all time, and he blew his first note in the Louisville orphanage that he called home. He was born in Louisville in 1908, and it was Bessie T. Allen, the orphanage director, who encouraged him to nurture his outstanding talent. Allen founded the old Booker T. Washington Community Center at Ninth and Magazine Streets.\n\nJones got his start playing cornet in the community center band before quickly transitioning to trumpet, where he excelled. As a young man, Jones left Louisville to begin his career playing with big bands and jazz groups, which would propel him to stardom throughout the classical jazz era of the '30s until the '60s.\n\nHe played on Mississippi riverboats with smaller triad jazz ensembles and ended up a big-band star early in his career. Jones and bop legend Dizzy Gillespie were both members of the trumpet section of the Cab Calloway Orchestra.\n\nJones won a Grammy in 1959 for the album \"I Dig Chicks.\" He was truly an entertainer who connected with the audience through lovely melodies that he both sang and played on the trumpet. He was sometimes referred to as \"King Louis II,\" a reference to Louis Armstrong.\n\nMae Street Kidd\n\nMae Street Kidd (1909-1999) was a businesswoman and civic leader who had a distinguished career in public relations, serving in the Red Cross during World War II, and serving the 41st Congressional District in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1968 to 1984.\n\nThe first bill she sponsored prohibited racial discrimination in housing. After several of Kentucky's cities passed their local open-housing legislation in 1966 and 1967, Kidd worked with Sen. Georgia Davis Powers and Rep. Hughes McGill to introduce the Kentucky Fair Housing Act to the state's General Assembly. Kidd's bill passed in 1968, making Kentucky the first Southern state to enact such a law on its own.\n\nKidd also sponsored legislation to name Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday a state holiday. She organized the first Louisville Urban League Guild in 1948 and was the past president of the Lincoln Foundation.\n\nKidd also led the campaign for Kentucky to ratify the U.S. Constitution's 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery), 14th Amendment (defining citizenship) and 15th Amendment (granting all men the right to vote regardless of race, color or previous condition of servitude), known collectively as the \"Reconstruction Amendments.”\n\nDuring her many years of activism, Kidd was a frequent presence in civil rights marches and events throughout Kentucky. She was also known for speaking her mind.\n\nMary E. Merritt\n\nMary E. Merritt (1881-1953) was born in Berea, Kentucky. After completing her primary schooling at age 12, Merritt attended Berea College and obtained credentials to teach school. She attended Berea College until 1903 when the Day Law forced segregation of the college.\n\nWhen Berea College added a nursing training program, she returned to school and graduated with a degree in nursing. Merritt continued her training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. Merritt was the first African American nurse to be licensed in Kentucky and was a recipient of the Mary Mahoney Medal for distinguished service in nursing from the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses.\n\nShe was the superintendent of nursing at Red Cross Hospital in Louisville. Louisville’s Red Cross Hospital was founded by African Americans during the Jim Crow era when racial segregation kept most African Americans from receiving medical treatment in the local area hospitals. The Red Cross Hospital was the only place in Kentucky that African Americans could be trained nurses until 1937, and Merritt spent most of her career as a nurse educator at the hospital.\n\nMerritt was awarded a certificate of merit by President Woodrow Wilson for her work in the Red Cross camp during World War I.\n\nAlbert E. Meyzeek\n\nAlbert E. Meyzeek (1862-1963) was born in Toledo, Ohio, the son of John E. and Mary Meyzeek. His early childhood years were spent in Toronto, Canada.

Meyzeek was a member of Kentucky's State Board of Education from 1948 to 1956, and was served as a principal and teacher at several Louisville schools. In 1893, he became the principal of the city's Booker T. Washington Elementary School. He also headed Central High and Jackson Junior High schools.\n\nMeyzeek was also a civil rights activist. He spearheaded drives to desegregate General Hospital's nursing school and Louisville public libraries. His investigation of poor housing for blacks led to the formation of the city's Urban League, where he served as chairman for 29 years. Meyzeek fought for libraries for African Americans in Louisville and for the development of Louisville Municipal College for Negroes. In 1905, the Western Library in Louisville opened. Founded by Meyzeek, it was the first library to serve Louisville's black community, and was one of the first of its kind in America. It was one of eight Carnegie-endowed libraries built in the early 20th century.\n\nThe Albert E. Meyzeek Middle School in Louisville is named in his honor.\n\nGarrett Augustus Morgan\n\nGarrett Augustus Morgan (1877-1963), the son of formerly enslaved Africans, was born in Paris, Kentucky. He was an inventor whose curiosity and innovation led him to develop several commercial products, many of which are still in use today. Morgan is probably best known for inventing the gas mask and the traffic light.\n\nWith only an elementary education, Morgan as a teenager left Kentucky for Cincinnati in search of employment. When he was 37, Morgan invented the gas mask, which was patented in 1914, and was used by the U.S. Army during World War I. In 1920, he started the Cleveland Call newspaper. Morgan became a successful and widely respected businessman. This prosperity enabled him to purchase a home and an automobile. Morgan’s experiences driving through the streets of Cleveland are what led him to invent the nation’s first patented three-position traffic signal.\n\nMorgan later had the technology patented in Great Britain and Canada. This technology was the basis for the modern-day traffic signal and was a significant contribution to the development of what we now know as Intelligent Transportation Systems. Morgan’s original wooden prototype traffic signal is on public display at Cleveland’s African American Museum along with one of the three original safety hoods still in existence.\n\nGeorgia Davis Powers\n\nGeorgia Davis Powers (1923-2016) was born Georgia Montgomery in the small African American enclave of Jimtown in Springfield, Washington County. Powers was the first African American to hold a seat in the Kentucky Senate. She worked alongside giants of the civil rights movement, and was a strong supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. She represented his views of change through peaceful demonstrations throughout Kentucky.\n\nAs a champion of civil rights, she introduced as her first Senate bill a statewide fair housing law, which prohibited discrimination in house. Even before holding office, she was one of the organizers of the Allied Organizations for Civil Rights, which worked for passage of statewide public accommodations and equal employment opportunity anti-discrimination laws. She was the chair of the Senate’s Health and Welfare Committee from 1970-76, and the Labor and Industry Committee from 1978-88.\n\nDuring her 21 years as senator, she sponsored civil rights legislation prohibiting sex, job and age discrimination. She also championed legislation for improved education for those with physical and mental disabilities.\n\nIn 1989, Powers was featured in a national photographic exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., called \"Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America.\" In 2010, the portion of Interstate 264 that runs through the West End of Louisville from Interstate 64 was renamed the Georgia Davis Powers Expressway.\n\nWilliam Benjamin Ray Sr.\n\nWilliam Benjamin Ray Sr. (1925-2019) was born in Lexington. He began singing at age 6 at the First Baptist Church of Lexington and graduated from Dunbar High School. Ray became a world-renowned opera and concert singer, music educator and civil rights advocate.\n\nRay followed in the footsteps of so many other African American performers when he moved to Europe to escape racism in the United States. Ray achieved star status as the leading baritone with Cuivillies Theater in Munich. A rich baritone who was fluent in German, Italian and French, Ray appeared in 14 different German-language roles onstage and on German and Austrian television. He performed in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Rigoletto” and many other productions, which led to television acting roles and music recording contracts.\n\nRay founded Black Theater Productions, which performed sketches highlighting racial prejudice and the dismal treatment of people of color in Stuttgart, Germany. Ray received the National Opera Association’s “Lift Every Voice” Legacy Award, honoring the contributions of African American artists to opera. After retiring from his illustrious career, Ray moved back to the United States and became a professor of voice at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore and eventually became the head of the voice department at Howard University in Washington, D.C.\n\nHarvey C. Russell Sr.\n\nHarvey C. Russell Sr. (1883-1949) was born in Bloomfield, Kentucky. He attended school at Kentucky State Normal School (Kentucky State University), Simmons University (Simmons College of Kentucky), and the University of Cincinnati. Russell had a long, distinguished career as an educator.\n\nHe taught at Bloomfield public schools, Frankfort Normal School, Booker T. Washington Elementary School and Louisville Normal School. He was dean of Kentucky State College (now a university) and president of West Kentucky Industrial College (now West Kentucky Community and Technical College) in Paducah.\n\nRussell was the author of \"The Kentucky Negro Education Association,\" 1877-1946, and he organized the first State Parent-Teachers Association and the first State Inter-High School Athletic Association. Russell lived in the Russell neighborhood — first at 1029 W. Madison St. and then at 2345 W. Chestnut St.\n\nThe neighborhood was named in his honor, as was Harvey C. Russell Junior High School. In 2017, the neighborhood was recognized with a Kentucky Historical Marker. In 2019, the Harvey C. Russell Sr. memorial mural was painted on the railroad overpass on Muhammad Ali Boulevard between 13th and 15th streets in the Russell neighborhood.\n\nBenjamin F. Shobe\n\nBenjamin F. Shobe (1920-2016) was the son of educators born in Bowling Green. Shobe was a circuit judge and one of the civil rights attorneys who helped integrate the University of Kentucky. He received a law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1946. He had wanted to attend the University of Kentucky or University of Louisville law schools, but African Americans were not allowed to attend graduate or professional schools in Kentucky at that time.\n\nShobe became an accomplished trial attorney. Then, in 1949, he, along with Thurgood Marshall (who later became a U.S. Supreme Court justice), James Nabritt and James Crumlin, represented Lyman T. Johnson and triumphed in the well-known case to admit African American students into graduate and professional schools at the University of Kentucky.\n\nIt took nearly seven decades later before Shobe was appointed to the 15th Division of the Jefferson Circuit Court where he served until his retirement. The Louisville Bar Association and the Louis D. Brandeis American Inns of Court developed the Judge Shobe Civility and Professionalism Award recognizing Shobe’s exemplary career.\n\nMoneta J. Sleet Jr.\n\nMoneta J. Sleet Jr. (1926-1996) was the first African American to win a Pulitzer Prize in photography. His major contribution to photojournalism was his extensive documentation of the civil rights movement. Born in Owensboro, Sleet's interest in photography began as a child. He pursued photography at Kentucky State College and received his master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1950. He later joined Ebony magazine as a staff photographer.\n\nIn 1956, Sleet met Martin Luther King Jr. just as he was emerging as the leader of the civil rights movement. He later covered King's acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and the Selma to Montgomery march in 1965. When King was assassinated in 1968, Sleet covered the funeral, resulting in the Pulitzer-winning photograph of King's grieving widow, Coretta, and youngest daughter, Bernice.\n\nHis early career covered the period of African national independence in the 1950s. Sleet photographed in Liberia, Libya and Sudan, and photographed Kwame Nkrumah at the moment of Ghana's independence. Over the years, his work has appeared in exhibitions at numerous museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Sleet received awards from the National Urban League in 1969 and the National Association of Black Journalists in 1978.\n\nMary Cunningham Smith\n\nMary Cunningham Smith (1842-1919) was the daughter of dance master/bandleader James C. Cunningham. Mary became a widely known pianist and organist throughout Louisville.\n\nLouisville’s civil rights movement was happening as early as 1870, when Smith and her 6-year-old stepson, Gustavus, boarded a streetcar on Eighth and Broadway, eight blocks from their house on Green Street. The streetcar operator removed them from the streetcar owned by the Louisville City Railway Company. Mary Cunningham Smith and her husband, Early Smith, a barber and saloon owner, filed a lawsuit against the Railway Company, indicating the company had removed them from the streetcar because of their race. The Smiths were represented by three white attorneys.\n\nThe Smiths won the lawsuit two years later, sparking continued protests by hundreds of African American demonstrators who gathered after church services at Quinn Chapel on Walnut Street in the heart of the Russell neighborhood. These demonstrations led to court cases that resulted in the African American community securing the right to sit and ride on streetcars in Louisville in the 1870s, more than seven decades before 15-year-old Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks refused to surrender their seats to a white passenger on a segregated bus in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nFrank L. Stanley Sr.\n\nFrank L. Stanley Sr. (1905-1974) was born in Chicago, as the only child of Frank and Helen Stanley. In 1912, Stanley moved with his widowed mother to Louisville, where he attended Central High School in the Russel neighborhood. Central High School was an incubator for him to rise to personify high academic achievement and become an outstanding journalist, educator, athlete, diplomat, politician, business leader and civil rights activist dedicated to community service.\n\nStanley was an influential civil rights leader as the publisher of The Louisville Defender. Under his editorship, The Defender became Kentucky’s top African American newspaper. He was a crusading editor whose advocacy for racial justice in employment, education, housing and public accommodations and for integrated military units during World War II predated the civil rights movement.\n\nStanley was received as a leading black publisher by presidents from Harry Truman to Lyndon B. Johnson. Stanley also traveled throughout Africa to conduct journalism seminars, sponsored by the U.S. State Department. Clothe-A-Child and the annual Louisville Black Expo are testimonies to the legacy of Stanley’s commitment to charity and economic development programs. He was a co-founder of the National Newspaper Publishers Association and a jurist for the Pulitzer Prize award panel.\n\nIn 1983, Stanley was inducted into the University of Kentucky's Journalism Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Rev. William E. Summers III\n\nThe Rev. William E. Summers III (1918-1996) was born in Louisville and became a community leader who was active in a number of civic groups. Summers became a noted African American broadcast journalist, making history in 1967 as the first African American in the United States to manage a radio station.\n\nIn 1971, he became the first African American radio station owner in the state of Kentucky when he purchased WLOU, one of five original R&B stations in Kentucky. Summers purchased the station in 1971 and ran WLOU until selling the station to the Johnson Publishing Company in 1982.\n\nSummers was also an ordained minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and pastured churches in Georgetown, Louisville, Shelbyville and Taylorsville. Summers' civic engagement also included working with the Urban League and the Boys Clubs of America. Summers, along with Frank L. Stanley Sr., co-founded Clothe-A-Child, which provided clothing for Louisville’s poor youth.\n\nHe served on the Kentucky Derby Festival Board and served as its first African American chairman in 1984. He was also a board member for the Transit Authority of River City and served as its chair in 1993.\n\nSummers was inducted into the University of Kentucky's Journalism Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nBertha Whedbee\n\nBertha Whedbee (1876-1960) was born in 1879 in West Virginia. By 1900, she and her husband, Dr. Ellis D. Whedbee, a well-known local physician, were living in Louisville. Whedbee was a former kindergarten teacher who joined the Louisville Police Department in 1922 after local officers mistreated her son. She petitioned the department to be appointed as a police officer and was allowed to work only with other African Americans. Whedbee was Louisville’s first African American policewoman to join the Louisville Police Department, decades before the civil rights movement and only two years after women got the right to vote.\n\nHer duties were restricted to “patrolling dance halls, apprehending thieves in downtown department stores, working with children and performing female body searches.\" As was the custom at the time, when the mayoral administration changed in Louisville, many officers left the police force, and Whedbee did so in 1927. Later administrations decided that women were not needed as officers, and in 1938 the four women working for the department at the time were fired. Louisville would not have female officers again until the 1950s.\n\nGen. Charles Young\n\nGen. Charles Young (1864-1922) was born in 1864 into slavery to Gabriel Young and Arminta Bruen in Mays Lick, near Maysville, Kentucky. However, his father escaped from slavery early in 1865, crossing the Ohio River to Ripley, Ohio, and enlisted in the Fifth Regiment of Colored Heavy Artillery near the end of the American Civil War. His service earned himself and his wife their freedom, which was guaranteed by the 13th Amendment after the war.\n\nCharles Young graduated from high school in Ripley, Ohio, at the top of his class at the age of 16. After graduation, Charles became a teacher and taught at an all-black high school in Ripley. He was the third African American graduate of the West Point Military Academy, the first African American U.S. national park superintendent, first African American military attaché, first African American to achieve the rank of colonel in the United States Army and highest-ranking African American officer in the Regular Army until his death.\n\nLater in his life, he returned to his educator roots and taught Latin, Greek, French, Spanish and German as well as military science at Wilberforce University in Ohio. Charles Young was promoted posthumously to Brigadier General on Feb. 11, 2020, by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Young is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2019/02/11/letters-lets-worry-gun-control-not-wall/2812569002/", "title": "Letters: Gov.

Kim Reynolds’ proposal to make birth control more accessible in Iowa irresponsible and politically self-serving [Iowans could have more access to birth control under proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds]. To fulfill this campaign promise, pharmacists would be allowed to dispense birth control pills, vaginal rings and hormone patches. Pharmacists would receive 20 hours of training on how to safely dispense and counsel patients regarding birth control.\n\nThis replicates the process now used to obtain Narcan from a pharmacist without a prescription [2,000 Iowans could get free Narcan spray to revive opioid overdose victims]. The problem with this replication is the vast difference in medication. Narcan is administered to a person in the emergency of a narcotic overdose. Birth control medication, which contains potent hormones, would be dispensed in a one-year supply.\n\nWomen all react differently to hormones. Safe use of hormones should include an evaluation by and recommendation from a physician. In 2017, Reynolds supported a bill that barred a state family-planning program from paying for birth control dispensed by Planned Parenthood or other agencies that provided abortions. The use of pharmacists to dispense birth control demonstrates Reynolds’ thinly veiled desire to dismantle Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn doing so, Reynolds is denying Iowans the right to self-determination and access to comprehensive reproductive health care and education provided by Planned Parenthood. The GOP-controlled Legislature must vote no to this proposal.\n\nMore:Gov.

The United States and our values have been a beacon of hope and prosperity for generations, so why has that changed? Is it because these newcomers are brown-skinned Latin Americans and not white Europeans?\n\nWhat is the role of education of our citizens about their plight? These children and their families are not enemies, they are human beings.\n\nAs educators, we are mandated to report and speak out against the atrocities being perpetrated against immigrant children in the custody of the United States government. They are being abused and subjugated to lifelong trauma. Their minds and spirits are being damaged by inhumane policies.\n\nWe are Elizabeth C. Bulthuis, the Iowa Teacher of the Year 2015 as well as Tisha Carter-Smith, 2014 Iowa Caregiver of the Year. We believe that children fleeing abuse, war, or violence shouldn’t be detained.

The increased corn demand E15 brings would help strengthen rural Iowa communities. Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) arbitrarily restricts the sale of E15 during the summer months.\n\nThe president, along with the acting EPA administrator, has promised to lift these restrictions, but the recent government shutdown placed a wrench in the process. There are real concerns that we’ll miss the June 1 deadline.\n\nIowa farmers like myself need access to growing markets, especially when trade disputes are heating up. We also need the EPA to enforce the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which is designed to stop oil companies from blocking real competition in the fuel market.\n\nIt is my hope that our leaders in Washington will make rural America a priority in 2019. Year-round E15 is a great place to start. We must keep pressuring the EPA to issue a final ruling before another busy summer driving season is lost.\n\nMore:Trump EPA pick Andrew Wheeler faces Democrats angry at environmental agenda rollback\n\n— Richard Harves, Dickens\n\nYou should know that blackface is wrong\n\nA recent letter depicting \"blackface\" condemnation as an inconvenience to white people must be addressed.

When I hear white folks talk or complain about where does appropriation begin and end, I have a real simple solution. Ask.\n\nAsk a black person. Ask a Native American. Ask or at the very least think about it before you do it.\n\nWe live in a society where white people have had the privilege to set the narrative about what is acceptable when it comes to just about everything.

I am alarmed and angry, and you should be too.\n\nHaving read about extreme abortion policies/laws in two countries, China and Romania, I know that attempting to legislate abortion away or to mandate it doesn’t work.\n\nIn our country that boasts about freedom, the right to ownership of one’s body ought to be a given. Therefore, decisions to have an abortion ought to be made solely by the woman, her faith, her physician and family and friends she loves and trusts.\n\nThe “pro-lifers” promote their position by offering support through the pregnancy but also attempt to make it difficult for a woman to obtain an abortion. The pro-choice folks have offered any assistance the pregnant woman feels she needs.\n\nThe solution is not an amendment to our constitution but a compromise in the area of prevention. Expand and improve sex education in schools. Make sure contraception is accessible, affordable or free — even in our high schools.\n\nMore:Successful plan to save infants from stillbirth still needs to reach more minority moms\n\n— Johanna Anderson, Osage\n\nWhat about fathers in the abortion discussion?\n\nThere’s a reason that people join the March for Life and vote for people who profess they will legislate to give rights to the unborn. The unborn cannot rally for themselves, they cannot hire lawyers, come up with catchy slogans, vote or speak about how abortion affects them.\n\nI have yet to read a single article on pro choice/abortion that mentions the father. Apparently all babies to be aborted are fathered by immaculate conception or by the infamous “healthcare provider.” He/she along with the mother are the sole abortion decision-makers.\n\nMy guess is that many of the fathers are happy to be absolved of the responsibility. Maybe if they were made to share in the abortion decision, or share in the support, we would have fewer unwanted pregnancies.\n\nWe don’t need more discussion on abortions and when they can be performed. What we need is a discussion between intimate partners on preventing unwanted pregnancy.\n\nMore:Anti-abortion activists, stung by recent court rulings, use defeats as rallying cry at Iowa Capitol\n\n— Steve Lame, Des Moines\n\nHOW TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\nLet's all stop bickering before 2020 race\n\nI had to reflect on my initial reaction to the latest claim of disrespect demonstrated by our elected leaders [Pelosi's attitude toward Trump is disrespectful]. Of course, at first, I saw red and thought about the numerous occasions our morally bankrupt president has said something disrespectful.\n\nBut then I thought, where is this getting us? Another tally for our side versus their side? After reading this letter, and thinking about the reactions people may have, we are no more ahead in the issues that matter.\n\nObjectively, our president has behaved disrespectfully on numerous occasions, and the optics of Pelosi mock-clapping at President Trump at the State of the Union address can be perceived as childish.\n\nThe bottom line is, I'm tired. Aren't we all tired of the bickering? There is so much noise and so little substance coming out of Washington these days. Lets not add to it by calling out when the other side does something bad. It has been done. After all, a wise woman once said \"When they go low, we go high.\"\n\nInstead of adding to the noise, let's dig deeper.

It’s their extraordinary leadership that has created better policies for all Iowans, including women.\n\n\n\nGOP leaders have shown their commitment to making it easier to find a job in our state by installing more skilled training programs and focusing our tax dollars on increasing education funding. They have also made it easier to be a small business owner by reining in out-of-control spending and keeping taxes low for all of us, including entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nIt seems that for Celsi, the tired rhetoric of the campaign has continued on to the legislative session.

My only wish is that it had been directed to every man and woman in this country and not just the politicians.\n\nAbortion rights should not be a political football. Abortion is a personal decision between the woman and her health provider. For those of you who are opposed to abortion rights, here are a few questions:\n\nAre you prepared personally to support the unwanted fetus? What will you do to to help feed, clothe and educate the young person?\n\nAs Rekha points out, we have so many problems facing us as a country. Here are a few more — drug addiction, poverty, immigration, education, wars on many fronts and the health of our veterans. Why must we debate abortion in the public arena?\n\n— Judith Nicholson, Waukee\n\nWe need to increase mental health access\n\nThe mental health crisis facing our state is a top priority for Iowa’s family physicians. Contrary to the Jan. 24 editorial [Iowa needs much more than a few additional psychiatrists to address mental health crisis], we do not need to “rethink the role of the family physician.”\n\nWe are trained, experienced and currently providing mental health services to Iowans, but we must increase access to care so that more Iowans can get the treatment they need.\n\nAccess to mental health services is especially a problem in rural areas and areas with vulnerable populations. The Iowa Academy of Family Physicians promotes policies that grow family medicine — and we actively recruit and train family doctors to practice in these areas. We also promote coordination between medical specialties and concur that providers should be adequately paid for providing these services.\n\nData published by the American Psychiatric Association on primary care training demonstrates that family medicine residency programs, which include at least seven years of postgraduate training, provide the most extensive psychiatric training of all primary care specialties.\n\nIowa already has about 2,000 family physicians on the front lines, treating the whole patient, providing provide mental health services and prescribing medications. The IAFP will continue to care for our patients’ mental health while fighting for Iowans to have access to the care they need.\n\nMore:Science Center of Iowa exhibit provides better understanding of mental illness\n\n— Jim Bell, President, Iowa Academy of Family Physicians\n\nHOW TO SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE EDITOR\n\nLet's worry about gun control, not a wall\n\nI wish I could figure out what concerns Republicans.

While Republicans want to spend great sums to build a wall, they will not even consider limiting the ability for mentally ill and criminals to obtain guns and assault rifles.\n\nWhy do they quake in their boots over immigrants, and yet think that thoughts and prayers are all we need to do to address the gun problem, which is statistically a much greater danger to each one of us?\n\nMore:Yes, Trump can declare an emergency and build a wall\n\n— Doris Render, West Des Moines\n\nWould changing judicial selection provide accountability or inject politics?\n\nI am insulted, as all Iowans should be, by the flimsy excuse being used by politicians to justify the bill to change Iowa's judicial nominating system [Gov. Kim Reynolds calls proposed judge selection process a 'good step forward'].\n\nSome politicians are claiming the legislation will depoliticize the system, but it does the opposite. Iowans are smart enough to see the hypocrisy and recognize this legislation for what it is: an attempt to control the judicial branch of our government by a political party.\n\nOur current system for nominating judges is nationally recognized as a fair and impartial system, a system Iowans approved via a state constitutional amendment. The proposed legislation will put the nomination process under increased political control.\n\nOur democracy is based on three independent branches of government as laid out in our constitution. So whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, you should be concerned about this attempt by one branch of government to limit the influence of another branch.\n\nMore:Garrett: Rewriting how Iowa selects its judges\n\n— Barb Wheelock, Ames\n\nMontessori education should be more attainable\n\nAlthough disappointed, I was not surprised to read about the halt on the new Montessori school [Des Moines shelves plans for new Montessori School].\n\nIgnoring for a moment Iowa’s year-by-year shrinking financial contribution to education at all levels and our ongoing decline as a model of educational excellence, let me praise Des Moines’ flirtation with the Montessori method.\n\nMaria Montessori recognized that kids want to be engaged, to “work.” Their work contains all the important elements of what we call “play.” Montessori student-centered education recognizes “sensitive periods” of child development, windows of opportunity to self-initiated learning while nurturing autonomy within multi-age grouped classes that encourage peer interactions and mentoring. The students are not tied to desks and spoon-fed didactics increasingly tailored to standardized testings. Montessori kids thrive.\n\nDespite Montessori’s successes and growing popularity, Des Moines Public Schools offers Montessori at Cowles School to only 400 of 32,000 students.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn “The Wizard of Oz,” a tornado sends Dorothy and her Kansas home spinning into the “Merry Old Land of Oz.” Last week it was what Politico called a “political earthquake” in Kansas that sent the national debate over abortion into a new phase with many unknowns.\n\nFor decades, the anti-abortion movement worked to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a national right to abortion. But their long-sought goal, finally achieved in June, may turn out to be a case of “be careful what you wish for.” By a vote of 59% to 41%, the people of Kansas rejected an amendment to the state constitution that would have eliminated the right to an abortion.\n\n“It’s a huge victory for abortion rights,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “The result in Kansas confirms that Americans simply do not want an extreme anti-abortion movement regulating women’s bodies. Kansans have said what most Americans believe: abortion is an issue best left to women and their doctors.”\n\nBut she added that this was a vote which should never have happened. “Fundamental rights – and it doesn’t get more fundamental than sovereignty over one’s own body – should not be up for a vote, even if the righteous side is likely to win,” Filipovic argued.\n\nWriting for Politico, John F. Harris suggested that the vote in Kansas, along with others that may follow, could scramble the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe. He may go down in history as the “the justice who facilitated a national consensus on behalf of abortion rights. Quite unintentionally, today’s hero of the ‘pro-life’ movement could end up being a giant of the ‘pro-choice’ movement.”\n\nTuesday’s vote in Kansas, which “mirrors polling showing solid majorities of people supported leaving Roe v. Wade intact, suggests that opponents of legal abortion do better when the prospect of an abortion ban is hypothetical, while abortion-rights supporters do better when the issue is tangibly real,” wrote Harris.\n\nA moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent, noted that “the overturning of Roe v. Wade has energized a previously demoralized Democratic base and could galvanize college educated suburban women in particular … If the GOP can’t win an abortion fight in Kansas, imagine the difficulty it will face in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”\n\n“Coupled with Trump’s stolen election obsession, mass shootings and a growing number of extreme GOP candidates in competitive races, the unpopularity of the Roe decision may mitigate Democratic losses in November, despite vulnerabilities on a number of other fronts (namely, the economy).”\n\nDent also faulted Democrats for running ads that backed extreme, election-denying candidates in the GOP primaries in the hope that Democratic candidates could more easily defeat them in the general election. In Michigan, “the courageous freshman Congressman Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump just days after being sworn into Congress, fell to an election-denying candidate, John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who was backed by the former President,” Dent wrote.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $300,000 on ads touting Gibbs’ “conservatism and fidelity to Trump,” wrote Dent. “I’m sure plenty of Democratic operatives are cackling over their success meddling in the GOP primary, but any smugness may turn into deep regret if Gibbs ends up prevailing in November. Those who play with fire often get burned.”\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nFor more:\n\nMary Ziegler and Elizabeth Sepper: The coming state-federal showdown over abortion\n\nAziza Ahmed and Ji Seon Song: Protecting patients’ privacy is paramount in time of uncertain abortion access\n\nJoel Pett/Tribune Content Agency\n\nNick Anderson/Tribune Content Agency\n\nNancy Pelosi drops in\n\nChina fired off missiles, flew jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and called off talks with the US on issues such as climate change and military relations. The reason: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which China sees as part of its territory.\n\nWhile Pelosi’s visit sparked apocalyptic warnings and fevered headlines, Taiwanese-American journalist Clarissa Wei wrote that the people of Taiwan are mostly unfazed. “What’s most frustrating about the reaction to Pelosi’s visit is not the prophetic declaration of imminent doom, but the expectation of fear and the surprise that follows when people realize that we aren’t all panicking in Taiwan – as if the calm we exude in light of unprecedented threats is a symptom of our ignorance of the facts before us.”\n\n“Threats from China are nothing new. They have been a part of my life, my parents’ lives and their parents’ lives for as long as almost anyone in my family can remember. In fact, Taiwan has been under threat by the People’s Republic of China for nearly 70 years. The three Taiwan Strait crises are proof of that.”\n\nAlex Jones\n\nA Texas jury ordered incendiary radio host Alex Jones to pay a combined $49.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting 10 years ago. Jones’ legal troubles aren’t over by any means: he faces two more such trials.\n\nOne of the parents, Scarlett Lewis, even had to testify that her son “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.”\n\n“It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make,” wrote Nicole Hemmer, “testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality.”\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\n“After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves.”\n\nBut as Hemmer noted, Jones is not a lone fringe player in the media world. He is “part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.”\n\n“More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.”\n\nIn Dallas, the Conservative Political Action Conference gave a warm welcome to Hungary’s autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\n“The audience cheered him on during his blistering attacks on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and more,” Julian Zelizer observed.\n\n“The illiberal and anti-democratic elements of Republican politics, which flared during the Trump presidency, are alive and well. As Orban’s popularity indicates, the profoundly anti-democratic strains that have been shaping the GOP keep getting stronger, not weaker…”\n\n“The talk comes on the same week that several election deniers, as well as participants in the January 6 insurrection, won in the primaries. The assault on the 2020 election continues to be a unifying theme in Republican circles. Even if some Republican voters are tiring of Trump, his rallying cry animates much of the electorate.”\n\nTerrorist leader killed\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nEleven years after then-President Barack Obama announced the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in a US raid, President Joe Biden described the tracking down and elimination of bin Laden’s former associate, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\n“The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice,” wrote Peter Bergen.\n\nStill, some of the claims about al-Zawahiri’s impact were overblown. “While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.”\n\nBergen added, “Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.”\n\nFamilies in turmoil\n\nGuy Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, the longest penalty meted out so far to insurrectionists who took part in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His son Jackson Reffitt had reported his father to the FBI on Christmas Eve 2020.\n\n“The Reffitts’ story is tragic, but hardly unique,” observed SE Cupp. “Chances are, you probably do know someone who’s been sucked into the cult of Trumpism, as Guy was.\n\n“Maybe it’s an aunt or uncle posting about rigged elections on Facebook, spreading Trump’s lie that the election was stolen…\n\n“Maybe it’s a father, or a mother, or a brother, who’s gone down a QAnon rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, and is no longer attached to reality.”\n\n“The carnage from Trump’s divisive rhetoric, lies, and conspiracy theories is incalculable. Trumpism is a powerful drug, one that can even cause a father to threaten his own child.\n\n“This was, incidentally, all by design. Trump stoked the fears and grievances of his base, turned Americans against each other, spread lies and conspiracy theories, undermined our faith in democratic institutions – all so that he could keep his supporters rabid, angry, willing to do whatever he asked. And sadly, many of them did.”\n\nFor more:\n\nPeggy Drexler: Loving your family even when they make horrible choices\n\nBill Russell and Nichelle Nichols\n\nOn and off the field, Bill Russell was a leader. On and off the screen, Nichelle Nichols was an inspirational role model. Both died last weekend.\n\nPeniel Joseph recalled Russell’s contributions as an athlete and a crusader against racism. “Russell was a 6-foot-10 center whose defensive prowess, rebounding skills and all-around leadership propelled the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years,” Joseph wrote. “As if appearing in a news reel of the most significant events of the civil rights era, he was present, time and again, at key moments for the movement, from the March on Washington in 1963 to his visit to Mississippi that same year following the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers…”\n\n“Over the years, he never lost his willingness to call out racism, or a perceived indifference to it. In recent years, he chided White Americans for their incredulity – in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and the racial and political reckoning that followed – about the existence of systemic racism.”\n\nWhen “Star Trek” premiered in 1966, one of the cast members “was the cool, sultry, supremely self-possessed Lt. Nyota Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, still a relative newcomer to television,” Gene Seymour recalled. In an era when the civil rights movement achieved its biggest successes, Nichols’ role had a symbolic significance. Yet “she was discouraged by her lines being cut from some of the episodes and was ready to move on to the Broadway stage. And she would have left if she hadn’t met a die-hard ‘Trek’ fan at an NAACP fundraiser in Hollywood: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.”\n\nKing “told her that he and his family enjoyed watching ‘Trek’ and rooted for her playing a non-stereotypical Black character. She thanked him but said she was on her way out,” Seymour wrote.\n\n“‘You cannot and must not!’” Nichols recalled King saying in her autobiography. “’Don’t you realize how important your presence, your character is? Don’t you see? This is not a Black role, and this is not a female role… You have broken ground. For the first time, the world sees us as we should be seen, as equals, as intelligent people – as we should be.’”\n\nNichols stayed with the show for its remaining two seasons and later would embrace “her importance as an inspiration and role model for young Black people whose dreams of space science and travel were emboldened by her character’s futuristic adventures.”\n\nDon’t miss\n\nSteve Breen/Creators Syndicate\n\nDean Obeidallah: There’s a good reason Jon Stewart is angry at Ted Cruz\n\nKara Alaimo: What petrifies me about sending my kids to school this year\n\nDavid A.

Alex Drueke, 40, and Andy Huynh, 27, had gone missing June 9 in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border. The Alabama residents were released as part of a prisoner exchange. The pair had traveled to Ukraine on their own and bonded over their shared home state. “It’s them!” a family member shouted as the pair appeared at the top of an escalator at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. Smiling but looking tired, the two were pulled into long, emotional hugs by family members after their connecting flight home, then whisked to a waiting car. “Surreal. I still have chill bumps,” said Drueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw. “I always imagined this day. I always held not just hope but belief in this day. But I thought it was going to be two or three years from now at best.” The families of the two men announced their release Wednesday. They were among 10 prisoners released by Russian-backed separatists as part of a prisoner exchange mediated by Saudi Arabia. “I had to get my hands on him to actually believe it,” said Darla Black, whose daughter is engaged to Huynh. “I’m just overwhelmed with gratitude. We got our miracle.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman was killed when the plane she was piloting crashed into Whiskey Lake near Skwentna, Alaska Wildlife Troopers said. The pilot was identified as Janell Rude, 67, of Anchorage, troopers said. An Air Force rescue team was deployed Sunday and found the plane submerged in the lake. She was the sole occupant onboard the Cessna 180A, troopers said. Troopers and military rescue swimmers recovered the body, which was then sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy. The National Transportation Safety Board said in a tweet that it was investigating the crash. Skwentna is located about 65 miles northwest of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Planned Parenthood asked a judge Monday to put on hold a ruling that allowed prosecutors to enforce a Civil War-era state law banning abortion in nearly all cases. Arizona’s largest abortion provider said the ruling issued late Friday has created confusion about the status of the law. Its lawyers cited conflicts created by the abortion ban dating to 1864, a more recent law banning abortions after 15 weeks, and a variety of other laws regulating the processes and paperwork when terminating pregnancies. “This confusion has forced Planned Parenthood Arizona to pause abortion services and cancel appointments scheduled this week – meaning that members of our community once again have been and will continue to be denied medical care that they deserve and need while this decision is in effect,” Brittany Fonteno, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson’s ruling lifted a 50-year-old injunction blocking enforcement of the 1864 law, which allows abortion only when the mother’s life is in danger. The injunction was imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed a right to abortion on 1973. Planned Parenthood asked Johnson to put her ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Pharoah Sanders, the influential tenor saxophonist revered in the jazz world for the spirituality of his work, has died, his record label announced. He was 81. Sanders, who launched his career playing alongside John Coltrane in the 1960s, died early Saturday, said the tweet from Luaka Bop, the label that released his 2021 album, “Promises.” It did not specify a cause. “We are devastated to share that Pharoah Sanders has passed away. He died peacefully surrounded by loving family and friends in Los Angeles earlier this morning. Always and forever the most beautiful human being, may he rest in peace,” said the label’s message on Twitter, accompanied by a heart emoji. Among the saxophonist’s best-known works was his two-part “The Creator Has a Master Plan,” from the “Karma” album released in 1969. The combined track is nearly 33 minutes long. Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1940, Sanders began his early musical life by playing drums, then the clarinet in church. In high school, he began renting out the school saxophone. After high school he moved to Oakland, California, where he intended to attend art school. But he soon moved to New York to join the city’s avant-garde jazz scene. He hitchhiked his way across country, he told The New Yorker magazine in 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A prominent law school named for a 19th-century rancher who sponsored deadly atrocities against Native Americans has a new name after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation approving the change. It was among several bills concerning indigenous people that the Democratic governor and former San Francisco mayor signed into law Friday, which he declared “Native American Day” in the state. The University of California’s Hastings College of the Law will be known as the College of the Law, San Francisco. The school’s graduates include former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. The school was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings, a wealthy rancher and former chief justice of the California Supreme Court who helped orchestrate and finance campaigns by white settlers in Mendocino County to kill and enslave members of the Yuki Indian tribe. The legislation also lays out restorative justice initiatives to be pursued by the college, such as renaming a law library with a Native language name, according to a statement from the governor’s office. Newsom also signed legislation to remove an offensive term for a Native American woman from all geographic features and place names in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A suburb’s plan to show a nearly 50-year-old movie at its arts center has officials scrambling to revamp the town’s indecency laws. The Denver Post reports the city of Parker plans to show the 1975 cult classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” at the Parker Arts, Culture & Events Center in October. But because the event center holds a liquor license, and the movie includes a momentary glimpse of a woman’s breast, the showing is prohibited under a town ordinance prohibiting “lewd and indecent” displays. “ ‘Lewd or indecent displays’ include the display of the female breast,” town staff said in a memo to Parker’s elected leaders. “Thus, the definition of ‘lewd and indecent displays’… would prohibit the screening of a movie, such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which displays the female breast.” Parker’s town council is considering two ordinances on the issue that officials say will bring the indecency code into compliance with a recent federal court ruling by no longer singling out female breasts – but not male breasts – as indecent. The council is expected to cast a final vote on the measures next month, potentially paving the way for the movie showing to continue as planned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nOld Saybrook: A 76-year-old man died Saturday when his SUV plunged into the water at Saybrook Point Marina and Resort in Old Saybrook, police said. Wedding guests at the nearby Saybrook Point Inn jumped in, pulled the man to shore and performed CPR but were unable to save him, police said. The man, identified as Steven Mark Wahle, of Old Saybrook, was pronounced dead at Middlesex Medical Center Shoreline in Westbrook. The incident happened about 10:15 p.m. The marina is located between the Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. A fire department dive team determined Wahle was the only person in the SUV. Police pulled the vehicle from the water and impounded it, pending an ongoing investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit against Democratic Gov. John Carney over the state’s requirement for political balance on its courts. Friday’s ruling is the latest in a long-running legal battle over a “major-party” provision in the Delaware Constitution under which judicial appointments to the state’s three highest courts are split between Republicans and Democrats. The Delaware Supreme Court, Court of Chancery and Superior Court are subject to a separate “bare majority” provision that also applies to Family Court and the Court of Common Pleas. That provision says no more than a bare majority of judges on those courts can be affiliated with a single political party. The result of the major-party provision is that any person not affiliated with either the Republican or the Democratic Party is unable serve on any of those courts. Wilmington lawyer James Adams, a former Democrat who is now an unaffiliated voter, claims that the provision violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by barring him from being considered for a judgeship on the Superior Court, a position for which he has twice applied and been rejected. Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Friday that Adams had legal standing to challenge the major-party provision and denied Carney’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police during the Jan. 6 siege has a book deal. Steven A. Sund’s “Courage Under Fire: Under Siege and Outnumbered 58 to 1 on January 6” will come out Jan. 3, just shy of the two-year anniversary of the riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. “It’s time to break my silence and reveal everything that I know happened,” Sund said in a statement released Monday by Blackstone Publishing. Sund resigned under pressure soon after the insurrection and testified the following month that he hadn’t seen an FBI field report warning of potential violence. He said the overrunning of the U.S. Capitol was the result of widespread failures. “No single civilian law enforcement agency – and certainly not the USCP – is trained and equipped to repel, without significant military or other law enforcement assistance, an insurrection of thousands of armed, violent, and coordinated individuals focused on breaching a building at all costs,” he testified. According to Blackstone, Sund will provide “a detailed and harrowing minute-by-minute account of the attack.” He will include a “never-before-heard accounting of a call from the White House” during the siege and “never-before-detailed conversations” between himself and congressional leadership.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz will begin their rebuttal case Tuesday, challenging his attorneys’ contention that he murdered 17 people because his birth mother abused alcohol during pregnancy, a condition they say went untreated. Prosecutor Mike Satz’s team is expected to call experts who will testify Cruz has antisocial personality disorder – in lay terms, he’s a sociopath – and fully responsible for his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. According to the National Institutes of Health, people with antisocial personality disorder commit “exploitive, delinquent and criminal behavior with no remorse.” They usually have no regard for others, don’t follow the law, can’t sustain consistent relationships or employment, and use manipulation for personal gain, the NIH says. Prosecutors will want to reemphasize Cruz “understood exactly” what he was doing during the massacre and could “formulate and carry out a plan,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A district attorney said he may revisit a decades-old case in which the state Supreme Court overturned three murder convictions of a Black sharecropper in the killing of a white man, aiming to determine whether the sharecropper deserves to be formally but posthumously exonerated. Weaknesses in the case were detailed in a book published this year, “The Three Death Sentences of Clarence Henderson.” Carroll County District Attorney Herb Cranford has launched a review of the case and could ask a judge to formally clear Henderson’s name, as charges against him were never dismissed, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. He was tried and convicted three times for the 1948 killing of 22-year-old Carl “Buddy” Stevens Jr., a Georgia Tech student who was shot while on a date in Carrollton, a town about 40 miles west of Atlanta. Henderson was arrested more than a year after the killing, and defense lawyers, including a biracial team funded by the NAACP, repeatedly poked holes in the prosecution’s case. Those questions, including some focusing on the alleged murder weapon at a time when forensic science was in its infancy, weren’t enough to persuade jurors to acquit Henderson. But they helped persuade appeals courts to repeatedly overturn the conviction. In January 1953, Henderson was allowed to post bail and leave jail, but the charges were never dropped.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A 52-year-old man has been indicted on multiple counts after he allegedly forced a 15-year-old girl to tie up her boyfriend, then kidnapped and sexually assaulted her, as well as forcing her to smoke meth. Authorities say Duncan Mahi walked up to the girl and her boyfriend at Anaehoomalu Beach on the Kona side of the Big Island on Sept. 16, put a knife to her throat, and took the girl’s money and her boyfriend’s cellphone. Court documents allege Mahi told the girl to tie her boyfriend’s legs and hands together using zip-ties and tape that he provided. He forced her to put the boyfriend’s shirt in his mouth, cover his head with a towel and secure both items with the tape, the police booking sheet said. Mahi told the girl she would die if her boyfriend got loose, according to the police account. Once at his property, he shackled her to a yellow bus behind the main house by putting a fabric cuff around her left ankle that was attached to a cable. Police said the girl managed to get free the next day after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat. A witness saw them scuffling outside Cafe Pesto and stopped Mahi from running after the girl. A homeless man sitting on the sidewalk said, “That’s the girl in the news,” after which Mahi ran to a car. Police found Mahi in Hilo about two hours later.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge has banned cameras from the courtroom in the high-profile triple murder case against a mother and her new husband, saying he fears the images could prevent a fair trial. Seventh District Judge Steven Boyce made the ruling Friday, saying news organizations will no longer be able to shoot still photography or videos inside the courtroom in the criminal case of Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell. The couple are charged with conspiring to kill Lori Vallow Daybell’s two youngest children and Chad Daybell’s late former wife, and the strange details of the case have drawn attention from around the world. Both Vallow Daybell and Daybell have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry a potential death penalty. Late last month, Vallow Daybell’s attorneys asked the judge to ban cameras from the courtroom. They contended that one news organization abused the privilege by repeatedly zooming in on Vallow Daybell’s face during an Aug. 16 hearing. The attorneys, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, also claimed the cameras and microphones could potentially be used to overhear private conversations or to view private notes on the defense table, though they did not suggest that the equipment had ever actually been used in that way.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man climbed five stories of a fire escape to infiltrate a police facility Monday while officers were undergoing a SWAT training exercise and grabbed at least two guns before he was shot and wounded by police, the chief said. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the suspect was taken to the hospital with injuries not considered to be life-threatening. One officer was taken to the hospital with a sprained ankle. Brown said the suspect was seen on video leaving the facility and then returning to infiltrate it. He asked where to go to retrieve personal property at the facility in Homan Square on Chicago’s West Side. Then he came back to the building and climbed the fire escape to the fifth floor, where a door had been propped open for ventilation because there are no windows on that floor. Brown said it has not been determined if the man went to the building to retrieve property, saying that the man had an extensive record. It wasn’t immediately clear if property taken from the man was stored in the building. He had no other information about the man, other than to say he was a resident of Waukegan, a suburb about 42 miles north of Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state could face a growing number of extreme heat days in the next 30 years, affecting the number of heat-related illnesses as well as seasonal energy costs in the state. The extreme heat designation is characterized by the National Weather Service as days on which the heat index reaches above 125 degrees. A recent study from First Street Foundation found that most counties in Indiana will continue to see high heat day hikes, with the southern portion of the state seeing the largest increase in what are called extreme heat days. Martin, Harrison and Clark counties are expected to see the greatest increase. Greenhouse gas-induced climate change is a driving factor for the rising number of high or extreme heat days in the 21st century, according to a 2020 Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences study. Urban development and population growth are also contributing to the growing number of extreme heat days. Low estimates show a minimum temperature increase across the U.S. of 2.5 degrees over the next 30 years, but since warmer air has a greater capacity to hold water, humidity will increase as well. This will have a compounding effect on heat indexes, the study says.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: The city is bucking a decades­long Beggars’ Night tradition by setting a new day for trick-or-treating. The Bondurant City Council in January passed a resolution that sets the trick-or-treat holiday, known as Beggars’ Night, to the last Saturday of October. That means this year, trick-or-treating is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Oct. 29 in the Des Moines suburb. In future years, trick-or-treating could be as early as Oct. 25 or on Halloween itself. Since the 1940s, cities across the Des Moines metro have held Beggars’ Night on Oct. 30 to avoid what had become some Halloween-night mischief. Most communities in the Des Moines metro will stick to that this year. In Bondurant, the idea to change to the last Saturday of October came from a community Facebook post. The city later conducted a survey to gauge interest. Of the 141 people who participated, 65% said they supported holding Beggars’ Night on a Saturday. City staff identified pros of setting a permanent day of the month, which included consistency, less rushing for families to enjoy the celebration, and kids not having school the next morning. Some possible cons included an impact on households with nontraditional work schedules, confusion about being the only metro community with that date, and a possible influx of people from outsiders.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After the state paid out up to $466 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits, an oversight council tasked with ironing out issues doesn’t know the status of correcting critical cybersecurity issues. “I just don’t have a lot of confidence right now in the security of the system,” said state Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, “and I’m afraid for Kansas citizens.” Contractor FORVIS performed a cybersecurity audit, broken down into a risk assessment report and a penetration testing report. The firm also performed a forensic audit of unemployment insurance, estimating up to $466 million in fraudulent payments. The council released a redacted version of the penetration testing report this month. The risk assessment report hasn’t been publicly released. Officials said the risk assessment identified 31 recommendations, including six of a high priority, 11 medium and 14 low. The agency didn’t disclose an update on any of the six high priority recommendations, telling lawmakers the information could only be discussed in secret. “It’s got to be noted that there are 206 vulnerabilities listed in this report, of which 43 of them are critical, 74 are high and 89 are medium,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, in apparent reference to the confidential risk assessment report from April.\n\nKentucky\n\nGreenville: A park in western Kentucky is being renamed after singer-songwriter John Prine. A dedication ceremony for the John Prine Memorial Park at Rochester Dam in Muhlenberg County is scheduled for Oct. 1, news outlets report. The project is part of updating an existing county park, said Karen Harper Lain, a spokesperson and committee member for the John Prine Memorial Park. The project includes a new boat ramp, more parking, a picnic pavilion, new playground equipment and landscaping improvements. Prine, who died in 2020, wrote “Paradise” for his father about the small town of Paradise on the banks of the Green River. Now a ghost town, the Muhlenberg County site became the home of a coal plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority from the early 1960s to 2020. Prine attributed the town’s demise to strip mining, with a father telling his son, who asks to return to the county and Paradise: “Mister Peabody’s coal train has hauled it away.” After his death, Prine fans began to visit Rochester Dam, which is also mentioned in the song, to leave memorials to the musician. Lain and others approached Muhlenberg County Fiscal Court about renaming the park after Prine’s death and said officials were “immediately on board.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has decided not to block the state’s plan to move two dozen troubled juvenile offenders from a suburban New Orleans detention center to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. In a 64-page ruling issued late Friday, Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick denied a motion to immediately halt the plan to move the teenagers to the adult maximum-security facility despite calling it “untenable” and “disturbing,” The Advocate reports. The state’s Office of Juvenile Justice proved in a three-day court hearing this month that it could provide the youth constitutionally required levels of care at the Angola facility, Dick wrote. “The prospect of putting a teenager to bed at night in a locked cell behind razor wire surrounded by swamps at Angola is disturbing,” the judge said in the ruling. “Some of the children in OJJ’s care are so traumatized and emotionally and psychologically disturbed that OJJ is virtually unable to provide a secure care environment.” But she also wrote: “While locking children in cells at night at Angola is untenable, the threat of harm these youngsters present to themselves, and others, is intolerable. The untenable must yield to the intolerable.”\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Clammers will once again be permitted to dig for soft-shell clams, quahogs, oysters and mussels at Brave Boat Harbor. With the nod of approval from the state Department of Marine Resources, the town is reopening a long-closed tidal flat now deemed safe for shellfish harvesting. A limited number of licenses to harvest shellfish from Brave Boat Harbor will be sold by the town starting in October to both residents and nonresidents, as approved by the Kittery Town Council. Chuck Moran, the town’s deputy harbormaster and shellfish warden, told the council that the Department of Marine Resources found Brave Boat Harbor to be safe for clamming close to a year ago. Since that time, the town has been working with the Department of Marine Resources to prepare for the tidal flat’s reopening and the rollout of shellfish harvesting licenses. “We are now ready to look to sell licenses and open up the clamming season,” Moran said. Department of Marine Resources spokesperson Jeff Nichols confirmed the state found Brave Boat Harbor, which had been closed for a number of years due to higher levels of fecal coliform, to be safe to reopen last October.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The official portrait of retired Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera has been unveiled. The depiction was destined to be highly symbolic, as it would be the first of 24 such drawings of the state’s top jurists going back to 1778 to feature a woman. But contained in the portrait are a host of symbols chosen to depict a dedicated judge, accomplished appellate attorney, fierce advocate, proud Marylander, and loving wife, mother and grandmother. Barbera stepped down from the high court last September upon reaching Maryland’s mandatory judicial retirement age of 70. Current Chief Judge Matthew J. Fader hosted the unveiling ceremony at the high court and said a young girl visiting the Court of Appeals might reasonably ask where the women are upon gazing at the portraits of all the men circling the atrium outside the courtroom. “After this afternoon, never again,” Fader said. “We will finally have a portrait of a female chief judge.” In the portrait, Barbera is seated in the red judicial robe she wore for the eight years she served as chief judge, and on her lap are legal briefs of a case pending before the high court. On the table beside her is a gavel, which she said represents not only the job of a judge but a note of thanks to her dozens of law clerks.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The city’s fire department has been awarded nearly $15 million in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hire 60 new firefighters and purchase new equipment. “This funding from FEMA will assist our department in accomplishing its mission to protect the lives and property of the community by increasing daily staffing for a safer and more effective fire and emergency response,” Acting Fire Chief Martin Dyer said in an announcement. “We have a growing community, and that requires increased resources to ensure we have the personnel and equipment needed.” The city received two grants. The Staffing for Adequate Fire Emergency Response program awarded $14.1 million for the salaries of 60 new firefighters over the next three years. A second grant of $806,000 from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program will increase the fire department’s inventory of self-contained breathing apparatuses, personal radios and turnout gear for new recruits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state loosened regulations on staffing levels this spring and allowed for more frequent lockdowns at Wayne County’s juvenile jail amid understaffing and overcrowding so severe it has been operating under a “temporary disaster” plan. Complaints have grown that the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Facility has confined residents to their rooms for long periods and deprived them of basic care, including daily showers, recreation time and vital medication. In a move described as “rare,” the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, which is charged with overseeing the facility, first approved the jail’s request for a temporary waiver of licensing rules at the end of April because of its staffing problems. The rules variance allows the jail to operate with fewer staff and lets them lock residents in their rooms facility-wide when there aren’t enough workers. A month after the rules were relaxed, police were called to control a group of 18 residents who had gotten out of their secure rooms, destroyed property and fought each other, after one boy may have popped a lock and snagged a staffer’s set of keys. The juveniles blamed their breakout, in part, on not being let out of their rooms. “We are tired of not getting our showers. Nothing against you,” a youth told a staffer, according to an internal county investigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: In-person voting for the midterm elections opened Friday, kicking off a six-week sprint to Election Day in a landscape that has changed much since the pandemic drove a shift to mail balloting in the 2020 presidential contest. Twenty people voted in the first hour as Minneapolis opened its early voting center, taking advantage of generous rules that election officials credit with making the state a perennial leader in voter turnout. First in when the doors opened was Conrad Zbikowski, a 29-year-old communications and digital consultant who said he has voted early since at least 2017. “I like to vote early because you never know what might happen on Election Day,” Zbikowski said, displaying his civic pride with a T-shirt that bore the sailboat logo of the City of Lakes. “You might get sick; you might get COVID; you might get in a car crash – there’s many things that can happen. But what you do have control over is being able to vote early and getting that ballot in.” Minnesota’s ballot includes races for governor and other statewide offices, with control of the Legislature at stake, too. Zbikowski said he doesn’t take the right to vote for granted, given that his family came to America from Russia when it didn’t have free elections. As a part-time poll worker – he was off duty Friday – he said he’s seen Minnesota’s safeguards firsthand and has full confidence in the integrity of the process.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: After the state spent millions of dollars in welfare money on Brett Favre’s pet project, a university volleyball arena, the retired NFL quarterback tried two years later to get additional cash from the state’s welfare agency for another sports facility, new court documents show. The governor at the time, Republican Phil Bryant, texted in 2019 with Favre, who wanted to build an indoor practice facility for the University of Southern Mississippi’s football team. Bryant told him federal money for children and low-income adults is “tightly controlled,” and “improper use could result in violation of Federal Law.” Text messages between Bryant and Favre are in court documents filed Friday by Bryant’s lawyers that seek to show the governor was willing to help Favre raise private money for the volleyball facility starting in 2017 and was unaware for more than two years that welfare money was going to the project. Mississippi’s largest-ever public corruption case has ensnared several people, including a pro wrestler whose drug rehab was funded with welfare money. The state has filed a civil lawsuit against Favre and others to recover more than $20 million in misspent welfare money intended to help needy people in one of the country’s poorest states. Neither Bryant nor Favre is facing criminal charges.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The speaker of the state House is urging the U.S. attorney in Kansas City to shut down Agape Boarding School, accusing the Christian school of “what amounts to organized crime against children.” Republican House Speaker Rob Vescovo sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore that was made available to reporters Monday. In it, Vescovo said state efforts to close the school have failed, and the local prosecutor has failed to take action to protect the boys who attend the school in the southwestern Missouri town of Stockton. “Right now in Missouri we are faced with the horrifying truth that a network of immoral individuals have engaged in what amounts to organized crime against children,” Vescovo wrote. But he said the situation is “more far-reaching and contains more deeply-rooted corruption than we are able to address solely at the state level.” Vescovo didn’t immediately respond to an interview request to explain his concerns about corruption. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City declined comment. Agape’s attorney, John Schultz, called the allegations against the school “100% false.” “There’s no evidence to support closing down Agape,” Schultz said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest is seeking outdoor enthusiasts to spend the spring or summer working to preserve and protect one of the landscapes that they love. “Positions are available in multiple fields, including fire, recreation, natural resources, range, timber, visitor services, and archaeology,” park officials said in a statement about the more than 150 seasonal jobs for next spring and summer, with a weeklong application window opening Thursday. “Whether you want to work outside next summer or help visitors plan their trips, working for the Forest Service is an excellent way to build lifelong skills and connections. You will have the opportunity to enjoy a challenging adventure while contributing to an important mission.” The forest encompasses 2.8 million acres across central and north-central Montana. It includes island mountain ranges bisected by the Continental Divide and Missouri River and portions of 17 Montana counties, extending from the border of Glacier National Park to the southern tip of the Crazy Mountains and east across the Big Snowy Mountains south of Lewistown. “This forest provides timber for people, forage for cattle and wildlife, habitat for fish, plants, and animals, and some of the best recreation opportunities in the country,” the news release said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A mining company that wants to extract an assortment of rare elements from southeast Nebraska has announced an agreement that will provide up to $285 million to help cover the roughly $1.1 billion cost of building the mine. In addition to a merger with a special purpose acquisition company called GX Acquisition Corp. II that NioCorp announced Monday, the Colorado-based company also signed letters of intent to borrow up to $81 million more from Yorkville Advisors Global. So NioCorp could get as much as $366 million to finance the project. NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said that “these transactions have the potential to put NioCorp on the fast track to obtain the required project financing.” The main element NioCorp plans to produce at the mine about 80 miles south of Omaha near the town of Elk Creek is a heat-resistant element called niobium, along with scandium and titanium. The company has said analysis of samples from the site shows there is also a significant amount of rare earth elements there like the ones President Joe Biden wants to produce more of domestically. But it’s not yet sure whether it will be economically feasible to also produce some of those elements that are used to create the strong magnets used in a variety of high-tech products such as electric vehicles and cellphones.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Gov. Steve Sisolak says the state is launching a prescription discount card, a method of softening the rising costs of medications. The digital card, called ArrayRX, saves an average of 80% on generic prescriptions and up to 20% on brand-name drugs and is free for Nevadans, Sisolak said. For those without health insurance, the card is set to lower costs significantly, the Democratic governor said at a Thursday press conference in Las Vegas. Those with health insurance will be able to compare their costs with ArrayRX and can opt for whichever option is cheaper, he said. “Taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health shouldn’t leave you bankrupt,” Sisolak said. State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said the digital card is “another tool in our toolbox to ensure that Nevadans can continue to afford the health care that they need and to take care of their families.” Sisolak announced in February at his State of the State address that Nevada would join Oregon and Washington in the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium, a program to reduce prescription costs through state discount systems. There is no cost to the state, Nevada’s Health and Human Services spokesperson said. Instead, a small transaction fee built into the price paid by the consumer helps cover the cost of the program.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSeabrook: The state Department of Safety’s report on the July 12 false alarm sounding at the NextEra Seabrook nuclear power plant finds that because there was no procedure in place for an inadvertent siren activation, it took almost an hour to start notifying the public there was no emergency at the nuclear plant. The result, according to officials in the beach communities, was a certain degree of panic from many beachgoers and local residents who had been told to leave the area by the sirens’ verbal broadcasts at 10:50 a.m. That panic was made worse by a few well-meaning but problematic good Samaritans who drove around Hampton telling people to evacuate because there was a problem at the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant. Although many could accept human error at the power plant caused the 10 alarms to be sounded by mistake, it was the lack of proper public notification that frustrated authorities and the public. It wasn’t until 11:49 a.m., according to the report’s timeline, that state officials transmitted information to the public of the inadvertent alarm activation via social media. WOKQ, the radio station listed in the Seabrook Station Emergency information brochures to get updated information in case of an emergency, was never notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Former Gov. James Florio, who championed a plan that substantially raised the state’s sales and income taxes, leading to his reelection defeat in 1993, died Sunday. He was 85. His law partner Doug Steinhardt and current Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed Florio died in statements Monday. “Governor Florio was a fighter who never backed down. He was a leader who cared more about the future of New Jersey than his own political fortunes,” Murphy, a fellow Democrat, said in his statement. Florio was a longtime public servant who held numerous posts on the local, county, state and federal levels. A Democrat, he made three unsuccessful gubernatorial runs before finally succeeding in 1989, when he defeated Republican Jim Courter and became the first Italian American to serve as the state’s chief executive. Florio drew sharp criticism in 1990 when he pushed a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature that extended a sales tax to, among other things, toilet paper. It spawned massive voter resentment and spurred the formation of Hands Across New Jersey, an anti-tax grassroots group that used rolls of toilet paper as its symbol. Florio was ousted after one term by Republican Christie Whitman, who tapped into voter anger over the tax hike and won the race by about 26,000 votes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has granted funds to pay for possible prosecutions connected to last year’s fatal film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The state Board of Finance greenlit more than $317,000 to cover the cost of investigating potential charges in the shooting on the set of “Rust” outside Santa Fe. First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies made an emergency request for the funds to go toward a special prosecutor, special investigator, several experts and other personnel. As many as four people could face charges, according to a copy of the request obtained by the newspaper, though Carmack-Altwies did not say anyone definitely would. “One of the possible defendants is well known movie actor Alec Baldwin,” she said. When reached for comment by the newspaper, she declined to say which crew members or cast could face charges. The possible charges at which her office is looking range from homicide to violations of state gun statutes. Carmack-Altwies said she is expecting to receive the final investigation report from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office soon.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City officials are appealing a judge’s ruling that they lacked the legal authority to fire members of the city’s largest police union for violating a COVID-19 vaccination mandate. State Supreme Court Judge Lyle Frank in Manhattan ruled Friday that the city health department’s mandate couldn’t be used to fire or put on leave members of the Police Benevolent Association. Frank said it was “undisputed” that city officials could issue vaccine mandates. But the judge said officials overstepped their authority by unilaterally creating a new condition of employment, as opposed to going through collective bargaining. Frank ordered the reinstatement of union members who were “wrongfully” terminated or put on unpaid leave for refusing to get vaccinated. The city immediately filed a notice of appeal, freezing the judge’s decision until the appeal is heard. “This decision confirms what we have said from the start: the vaccine mandate was an improper infringement on our members’ right to make personal medical decisions in consultation with their own health care professionals,” PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. A spokesman for the city’s Law Department said the ruling “is at odds with every other court decision upholding the mandate as a condition of employment.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: After years of anticipation, a collection of rarely exhibited drawings by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn is now on display at the Ackland Art Museum. The Ackland’s newest exhibit, “Drawn to Life: Master Drawings from the Age of Rembrandt in the Peck Collection,” includes dozens of 17th and 18th century drawings by Dutch and Flemish artists, including five sketches by Rembrandt, who died in 1669. They’re all from the Peck Collection, which the Ackland received in 2017. It was the largest-ever gift for the UNC-Chapel Hill art museum, courtesy of the late UNC alumnus Sheldon Peck and his wife, Leena Peck. This vast collection, valued at $17 million, included 134 Dutch and Finnish drawings. “Drawn to Life,” with 70 pieces of work, marks the first time many of these drawings will be on view to the public since the donation. The museum notes that many can only be on display for short periods of time because they’re sensitive to light. While Rembrandt’s paintings and portraits from the Dutch Golden Age famously strike viewers with awe and a radiant glow, these drawings tell a vastly different story. This collection features more understated works that are meant to be looked at for longer periods of time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There is little indication that an 18-year-old who died after being struck by an SUV was a political extremist as the driver claimed. Investigators say none of the witnesses they have interviewed support the idea that there was a political argument before authorities say Shannon Brandt struck Cayler Ellingson with his vehicle Sept. 18 in McHenry, and a family friend who knew the teen said he wasn’t active in politics. Court documents said Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that he felt threatened after having a political argument with Ellingson and believed the teen was part of a “Republican extremist group.” North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said Friday that authorities have talked to dozens of witnesses and plan to talk to more as they try to get a better picture of exactly what happened before the crash. “I can’t get into details about what the witnesses are describing to us. But what I can tell you is that this is not political in nature at all,” he said. “There is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim on the 911 call that Mr. Ellingson was a Republican extremist. There is no evidence to support that all through our continued investigation.” He also said there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was calling others to come hurt Brandt.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Teachers barricaded classrooms, kids texted their parents, and police rushed to high school campuses across the state Friday as a rash of hoax reports of school shootings were made. Legislators are trying to make it a felony to knowingly make a false emergency report. State Rep. Kevin Miller, R-Newark, and state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, have introduced companion bills to increase the penalties on “swatting” − making bogus reports to bring about a big police response, usually to a residence. The legislation would make it a third-degree felony and elevate it to a first-degree felony if anyone is seriously injured as a result of the false report. Those convicted could also be ordered to pay the government for resources spent on the hoax call. “I’m appalled by this type of behavior. It especially sickens me that they’d do this to schools. Think of the emotional impact that these types of incidences have on all those involved,” said Miller, a retired state trooper. He said currently such calls are prosecuted as misdemeanors under inducing panic or making a false alarm. Brenner said in testimony that swatting started as a prank among online gamers who would call in a report to get a SWAT team to show up while someone was streaming their video game play. Brenner and Miller both said they hope their bills gain momentum when lawmakers return to voting session after the elections.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A church with a distinctive white, egg-shaped dome was torn down early Monday after the congregation’s attorney previously said recent asbestos removal was not part of any plan to destroy the First Christian Church building. The property, which also includes the former home of Jewel Box Theater, was home to one of the city’s biggest churches when it opened in the 1950s. The property was put up for sale in 2017 with a dwindling congregation still worshipping there. Preservationists thought they had a savior for the building when Crossings Church signed a purchase contract for the landmark in 2019. But that deal fell through when the congregation’s leadership concluded the costs of renovation exceeded their budget for a new location. A local developer, Andy Burnett, was among the latest to make an offer for the property. When contacted by phone Sunday night, Burnett confirmed he offered $2 million, all cash, with a closing in 45 days, to buy the property and keep the buildings standing as part of indoor and outdoor sand volleyball and sports complex. Burnett said he had not gotten a response but was hopeful and willing to continue the conversation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Some parks officials say high demand for crowded campsites is leading to arguments, fistfights and even so-called campsite pirates. Brian Carroll with Linn County Parks and Recreation said park rangers had to play mediator this summer as would-be campers argued over first-come, first-served campsites at Sunnyside County Park. “People were literally fighting over campsites,” Carroll said. “What we experienced this year was certainly a general level of increased frustration and anxiety of people not being able to get their campsite. There seems to be less general common courtesy going on.” Tensions also escalated over reserved campsites, with some recreationists wrongly claiming already-reserved sites by tearing off the reservation tags and replacing them with their own, prompting the nickname “campsite pirates.” The original parties end up angry and confused when they arrive to find their campsite occupied. The practice isn’t common, but it’s happening more than it used to, Carroll said. “In the past, it was extremely rare,” he said. Earlier this year, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said it would seek legislation to give rangers added protection because of the increasing level of assaults and harassment targeting rangers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers at the Philadelphia Museum of Art began a strike Monday, citing wage and health care issues, as the institution said it would remain open during the walkout. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the union representing about 180 of the museum’s approximately 350 workers set up picket lines Monday at entrances to the main building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and at the nearby Perelman Building and the Rodin Museum on the parkway. The museum posted a notice on social media saying it was open as usual Monday, with officials saying managers and nonunion employees would run the operation. “We are committed to serving our community as we continue to negotiate in good faith toward a fair and appropriate new labor agreement,” the museum said. Museum workers voted to unionize in July 2020, and leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 47, Local 397, said Friday that they had been in talks with the museum on a new contract for two years without success. Union officials said higher wages and reducing health care costs are among the important issues outstanding. “Our members will not accept a contract that does not bring wages and benefits at the museum up to an acceptable standard,” DC47 President Cathy Scott said in a statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With his Republican challenger nipping at his heels and calling him “out of touch,” Gov. Dan McKee on Monday scaled back, for now, the raises of up to 43% his administration was proposing for his Cabinet members. In a statement read aloud at a public hearing by Brian Daniels, the head of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, McKee said he was unaware of the state law dictating flat salaries for high-level agency directors when his administration submitted the original salary package. Among the proposed moves: a $60,000 pay hike for the state’s health director that would raise the salary for the position – held by a series of temporary replacements since Dr. Nicole Alexander Scott’s resignation last winter – from $140,000 a year to $200,000 a year. When first talking about that and other double-digits pay hikes, McKee said he envisioned them as new salary maximums to be phased in over time, not all-at-once increases. “However, it is now my understanding that, by statute, the proposals represent flat rates and not salary caps,” he said. “With that in mind, I conducted a balancing test between what is best for talent development in the civil service and what is the most fiscally responsible path forward for Rhode Island taxpayers.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 20 people were arrested and more than 300 dogs rescued as authorities raided dogfighting kennels in the state, federal prosecutors said Monday. The sting started when state and federal agents interrupted a dog fight in Richland County on Saturday, U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said in a statement. That led agents to serve 23 warrants Sunday at what were known to be places where dogs fight or are trained to fight in Clarendon, Lee, Orangeburg, Richland, Sumter and York counties, investigators said. Twenty people face state charges of animal cruelty and dogfighting, authorities said. Investigators also seized about 30 guns and $40,000 in cash, prosecutors said. Officials said 305 dogs were rescued, with about 275 of them believed to be part of the dogfighting ring. The Humane Society of the United States and Bark Nation are helping to take care of the dogs. Some of the dogs had severe scars, open wounds and cuts, the Humane Society said. Some of the dogs were unusually thin, chained to trees with no way of getting food or water, the agency said. The arrests over the weekend are the first steps in a broader investigation that could include federal charges, Boroughs said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State Rep. Linda Duba, D-Sioux Falls, shared her abortion story for the first time in public during a reproductive justice rally organized by the South Dakota Democratic Party on Sunday. Standing on a stage and speaking to a crowd of people dressed in green – the international symbol for abortion access – at Fawick Park in Sioux Falls, Duba told the story of a young college girl in the winter of 1976 who found herself pregnant. Although abortion had been legal in the United States for nearly three years with the passage of Roe v. Wade, abortions were still not provided in South Dakota. “She came from a family who was pretty strict. She was worried about what people would think of her if they found out that she was pregnant, and that young girl was me,” Duba said. Duba was one of five speakers, four of whom are running for office this November, who spoke about the importance of abortion access. Because of a 2005 trigger law tied to the U.S. Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe in June, abortions in South Dakota are banned, even in cases of rape and incest. Duba said that women today must travel out of state, similar to what she had to do 47 years ago when she was a sophomore at South Dakota State University and went to Minneapolis on a Saturday for a 15-minute abortion procedure. “It was probably one of the scariest times in my life, and then I came back home, and I never told a soul,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are being asked to cement a right-to-work law into the state constitution at the ballot box in November – a move touted by pro-business leaders but adamantly opposed by labor unions. The state’s right-to-work law allows employees to opt out of joining a union and paying the dues even if the workforce is unionized. Tennessee’s major unions are against Amendment 1 and criticized the right-to-work law for creating a “free-loader situation.” “It makes unions the only entity that has to provide services to people who did not pay for them,” said Jason Freeman, the political director with Service Employees International Union Local 205, based in Nashville. “A majority of workers in a place can choose to unionize, and then the people who have not joined are entitled to the benefits and services their co-workers are paying for, while they are not.” Supporters of the amendment said they believe the right-to-work law bolsters Tennessee’s business-friendly economic climate and provides workers with a choice. “Through unions, employees can be forced to join something that they disagree with,” said Justin Owen, the president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a conservative think tank. “That violates their freedom of association and should ultimately be left up to the individual.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A year after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott defended the state’s new abortion law – which makes no exceptions in cases of rape – by assuring that Texas would get to work eliminating sexual assaults, Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston. “The numbers have stayed consistently high,” said LeBlanc, executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan, near Texas A&M University. Despite hiring two additional counselors in the past six months, she still has a waitlist for victims. “We are struggling to keep up with demand,” she said. Overwhelming majorities of voters think their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including rape, incest or if the health of the pregnant person is endangered. Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape, spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs, a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources, and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue. More than 14,000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year, according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Two women survived a mountain lion attack over the weekend when they were running in a canyon east of Salt Lake City. They came upon the mountain lion as they came around a corner on a trail run Sunday morning in Millcreek Canyon, said Faith Jolley, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The mountain lion leapt at the woman closest to the animal, leaving two puncture wounds on leg, she said. They were able to get away and down the mountain after the uninjured woman threw a rock at the mountain lion. The woman’s injuries aren’t considered life-threatening, Jolley said. Wildlife officials later found the mountain lion they believe was the one in the attack and euthanized the animal. Jolley said mountain lion attacks are quite rare in that part of Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The retail sale of adult-use marijuana becomes legal in the state Saturday, ushering in a new source of revenue for Vermont, as well as satisfied customers, advocates hope. But in reality, hardly anyone will be ready to start selling Oct. 1. As of Friday, only three businesses had their licenses from the Cannabis Control Board: Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland, FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury and CeresMED in Burlington. And only three businesses had their licenses from the city of Burlington − Ceres, Grass Queen and Green State Dispensary − making CeresMED the only business in the city with both state and city licenses in place. Russell Todia, chief operating officer of CaresMED, said in an email that the downtown Burlington store is “tracking to begin adult-use cannabis sales in Vermont on October 1.” Nellie Marvel of the Cannabis Control Board said Friday the board will likely approve at least one more retail outlet at next week’s board meeting. “I cannot say at this time which those might be, or how many will be presented to the board for approval,” Marvel said. “Those numbers are subject to change pretty much until the last minute as we continue to have communications from applicants.” A total of 30 businesses have applied to the Cannabis Control Board for retail licenses.\n\nVirginia\n\nMcLean: The CIA has revealed a model of Ayman al-Zawahri’s safe house, used to brief President Joe Biden about the al-Qaida leader’s whereabouts before the agency killed him in a drone strike in Afghanistan. Shortly after al-Zawahri’s death, White House officials released a photo showing Biden talking to CIA Director William Burns with a closed wooden box on the table in front of them. Now, the contents of the box – a model depicting a white-walled home with at least five stories and three partially obscured balconies – are on display at the CIA Museum inside the agency’s Virginia headquarters. The museum is closed to the public, and access is generally limited to the agency’s employees and guests. The CIA allowed journalists to tour the museum, newly refurbished in time for the agency’s 75th anniversary, as part of a broader effort to showcase its history and achievements. Most of the exhibits took years or decades to declassify. The al-Zawahri model home is the rare artifact that had been used by intelligence officers just weeks beforehand. Al-Zawahri was killed in late July, nearly a year after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ending a two-decade war in which the CIA had a central role. The agency sent the first American forces two weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the greater Seattle area will be asked to approve as much as $1.25 billion in new taxes to improve the mental health system and build five regional crisis care centers. The Seattle Times reports King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and others on Monday said they would put the tax plan on the April 2023 ballot. The King County levy would begin in 2024. The median-value homeowner would pay about $121 that year and continue through 2032. Officials did not say where the new five crisis facilities would be located. The tax package would also maintain and invest in residential treatment beds at long-term facilities that provide youth and adults with addiction and mental health treatment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeaver: A federal civil rights lawsuit has been filed against a jail on behalf of current and former inmates who have described conditions at the facility as inhumane. The complaint filed last week about conditions at Southern Regional Jail in Beaver references a lack of access to water and food, as well as overcrowded conditions and fights that were allowed to continue until someone was injured, WVVA-TV reports. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the station that the agency could not comment on ongoing litigation, but an investigation of conditions at the jail earlier this year found no evidence of inhumane treatment. Republican Gov. Jim Justice ordered the investigation in March after WVVA reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in an April statement.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative news outlet sued the Wisconsin Parole Commission on Monday, alleging that it has refused to comply with open records requests made earlier this year. Wisconsin Right Now has been publishing a series of articles highlighting violent offenders who have received parole under Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration. A reporter for the outlet in May requested lists of all offenders who have been granted parole, release or early release since 2019, when Evers appointed John Tate as chairman of the commission. The commission sent a list of offenders released through 2021 and said in June that it would provide more recent information as it became available. According to the lawsuit, the commission did not respond to further communications or provide that information. The commission and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to messages left Monday. Tate stepped down from his role in June at Evers’ request after the decision to parole a man who served less than 25 years of an 80-year sentence for stabbing his wife to death angered the victim’s family and drew criticism from Republicans in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state’s Department of Transportation wants to use 23 acres of federal land to house temporary laborers as construction ramps up on a highway project, but conservationists are pushing back, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The parcel, under U.S. Bureau of Land Management control, isn’t “an appropriate site” and would be better turned into a public park, a proposal first made in the 1990s, said Jared Baecker, director of the nonprofit Snake River Fund. Bob Hammond, an engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation, told the newspaper that while he understands the desire to preserve the land for recreation, “there’s no funding to do it in the next five or more years.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/bicentennial/2024/03/04/tlh-200-the-200-people-who-shaped-tallahassee-ahead-of-bicentennial/72795474007/", "title": "TLH 200: The 200 people who shaped Tallahassee ahead of ...", "text": "James Call and Greg Tish\n\nTLH 200 writers\n\nThe TLH 200: Gerald Ensley Memorial Bicentennial Project is proud to present our rolling list of 200 people who laid the foundation and contributed to the growth of the civil society we find today in Tallahassee.\n\nAs the city commemorates the 200th anniversary of its founding, the Tallahassee Democrat and Real Talk 93.3 have cast a wide net to find artists, educators, civil rights leaders, politicians, athletes, builders, business titans and neighborhood icons who have earned a spotlight.\n\nBut we need your help.\n\nYou can email your suggestions of candidates to be profiled and other suggestions to history@tallahassee.com. And listen to Greg Tish’s morning show on Real Talk 93.3 where we'll discuss the legacy of these history makers.\n\nThe only condition is that those featured below must be deceased. Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 90 names.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nRecipe:How to remember Tallahassee cookie whisperer Wally Amos? Try his original recipe\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues:Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camellias, ligustrum, palms, and Pyracanthas to landscape the roadway as part of the project – creating 45 additional jobs.\n\nThe 26-mile long project from the east side of Tallahassee to the Monticello courthouse would take 15 years to complete.\n\nWhen it was completed in 1948 and Mahan recognized with a marker then-state senator and future Gov. LeRoy Collins called Fred Mahan Drive “a corridor of goodwill\" that connects the two cities.\n\nIt is said during his life Fred Mahan donated nearly 400,000 trees, shrubs, and flowers, to schools, churches, cemeteries, hospitals, parks, squares, and public thoroughfares.\n\nCalvin Jones (1938 - 1998)\n\nCalvin Jones would say, “The dirt don’t lie.” Jones would know. He made some of the most important discoveries of ancient humans in Florida during a 30-year career at the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research.\n\nJones had an uncanny ability to look at a piece of land and predict whether artifacts would be found.\n\nWorking in advance of interstate construction near Tampa, Jones discovered the earliest tangible evidence of humans on the peninsula, dating to 12,000 years ago.\n\nAcross north Florida he uncovered a prehistoric site at Lake Lafayette, found the sites of nine Spanish era missions, and discovered the Apalachee burial mounds at Lake Jackson – which at the time was called the American pyramids.\n\nJones was a Texan, descendant of Creek and Cherokee natives.\n\n“I can’t talk mythology, but I know what's in the ground,” Jones told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley in 1997.\n\nFor years on his morning commute to work Jones had eyed a hillside opposite the State Capitol, suspecting it had a story to tell.\n\nHe got permission to poke around in 1987 and made his most heralded discovery – the 1539-40 winter encampment of Hernando de Soto.\n\nJones unearthed pottery, coins, and chain mail, to link the land to De Soto’s expedition – the first verified DeSoto camp from his exploration of the continent.\n\n“You cannot disturb the earth without leaving imprints,” Jones said.\n\nDaniel Dale Green (1955 -2002)\n\nTallahassee Police Department Sergeant Daniel Dale Green was shot and killed in an ambush while responding to a home-invasion on Melody Circle.\n\nGreen was a 13-year veteran with TPD, having served as an expert sniper, trainer, field supervisor, and a K-9 patrol officer.\n\nAs he approached the scene, Green observed a suspicious car with its engine running. He called in the vehicle’s description and tag number. The dispatcher then heard gunshots.\n\nA second officer rushed to the scene; Green had been shot four times in the back of the head.\n\nThe suspect fled north, Green was rushed to the hospital, and law enforcement swarmed into the northwest sector where they sealed off Sharer Road near the Fun Station.\n\nGunfire was exchanged with the suspect who then surrendered.\n\nAt Tallahassee Memorial Hospital TPD officers, sheriff deputies, and Highway Patrol troopers stood watch. About 21 minutes after the suspect was taken into custody, Sgt. Dale Green’s death was announced.\n\nGreen left behind a wife and three children.\n\nA Tallahassee native, Green was remembered as a “lover of music, fishing, and camping.”\n\n“Everybody just loved him,” said then-city commissioner John Paul Bailey the night of the shooting.\n\nBailey, a retired police officer, had served with Green before Bailey's 1996 retirement.\n\nIn May 2014, Desoto Street was renamed Sgt. Dale Green Way\n\nJune Fouts Strauss (1930 - 2010)\n\nJune Fouts of Jacksonville arrived at the Florida State University campus in 1948 where she met Buddy Strauss, from a pioneer Tallahassee family.\n\nThe two married in 1950, raised six children, and June became Tallahassee’s volunteer extraordinaire.\n\nA 1998 Tallahassee Democrat profile concluded no one had done as much to promote art and theater in Tallahassee or help as many abused children get a new start than June Fouts Strauss.\n\nBusinessman Mark Goldman said a photograph of Strauss should be listed in the dictionary with the definition for “superlative.”\n\n“And I’m not prone to superlatives,” Goldman told the Democrat’s Dorothy Clifford.\n\nStrauss served as a homeroom mother at Blessed Sacrament School (now Trinity Catholic) for 17 consecutive years (1957 – 1975).\n\nAnd she helped organize iconic Tallahassee organizations and clubs. Strauss was a founding member of the boards for the LeMoyne Art Foundation, the Southern Shakespeare Festival, Florida State University School of Theatre’s Patrons Association, and the Governor’s Club.\n\nIn 1985, she established the first Boys Town USA campus outside of Omaha, Nebraska, where the 106-year-old residential care facility for youths was founded. She would serve on the organization’s National Board of Trustees for six years.\n\nIn 1986, Strauss played a key role in raising money to create the Tree House emergency shelter for abused and neglected children.\n\nStrauss was the Tallahassee Democrat Volunteer of the Year for the Arts in 1980 and the Department of Children and Families nominee for the social services Volunteer of the Year in 1998.\n\nShe deflected any credit for accomplishments sent her way, saying the accolades belong to others.\n\n“I'm a facilitator - someone else had the original idea,\" Strauss said.\n\nThe second Tree House site, established in 1989 is named the “June Strauss Tree House.”\n\nDr. Eva Wanton (1935 - 2014)\n\nIn remote west Africa you will find a library named for a Tallahassee language professor.\n\nDr. Eva Wanton of Thunderbolt, Ga., accepted a one-year appointment as a Florida A&M University foreign language teacher in 1964 and then decided to make Tallahassee home.\n\nAt FAMU she would go on to become a full professor, a dean, an associate vice president, and a special assistant to interim president Castell Bryant.\n\nShe described her relationship with the school to Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley as a “love obsession.”\n\nStudents loved her back.\n\nIn 1997 when a university reorganization plan eliminated Wanton’s position, they launched a petition drive and held rallies on her behalf. Wanton was promoted to Vice President of Academic Affairs.\n\n\"I was kind of in awe of her brilliance,\" Eddie Jackson, the late FAMU communications director, said at her passing.\n\n\"Her control and mastery of English was so great and so graceful. It was a joy to hear her speak. Whenever I saw she was going to speak (at an event), I knew I was in for a treat.”\n\nWanton loved to travel. One trip took her to Ghana where she came across a village where animals and children shared the same water supply.\n\nBack home she told her church what she had seen. The Africare Ministry at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church dug the village a well and adopted their school.\n\nIf you go to Mampong, Ghana and stop at the Bong Rong School you can visit the Dr. Eva C. Wanton Library and Computer Laboratory.\n\nIt was dedicated in 2017 to the professor who connected the village to a Tallahassee church that helped raise the money to build, equip and staff the school.\n\nJudge Joseph Woodrow Hatchett (1933 - 2021)\n\nJoseph Woodrow Hatchett of Daytona Beach came to Tallahassee to study at Florida A&M University and became a man of many firsts.\n\nHatchett was the first Black Florida Supreme Court Justice, the first and only Black man to win a statewide election, and the first Black federal appeals court judge in what was once the Confederacy.\n\nHe accomplished this after Jim Crow prevented him from having lunch or staying overnight in the hotel where the Florida Bar examination was administered.\n\nHatchett passed the bar and today the federal courthouse in Tallahassee is named in his honor.\n\nA FAMU and Howard law school graduate, Hatchett was remembered by former clerks, and colleagues as a jurist who never lost faith in law as an instrument of justice.\n\nA former clerk said in Hatchett’s 600 opinions you find a deep compassion for protecting the rights of people, especially the oppressed.\n\nGov. Reubin Askew appointed Hatchett to serve on the Florida Supreme Court in 1975. The next year he stood for reelection and became the first Black man since Reconstruction to win a statewide election in the South, and remains the only Floridian to do so.\n\n“I wonder if Judge Hatchett could have imagined ..., the United States Courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida’s Capitol, just blocks from his alma mater, would be named the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building,” former Hatchett clerk and now Eleventh Circuit Judge Charles R. Wilson said at the courthouse designation ceremony in 2023.\n\nRomulus Thompson (1906 - 1996)\n\nAfter Leon schools decided to form a Leon High School Redcoats Marching Band in 1939 a statewide search found Romulus Thompson, the Crestview High School band director and a former assistant director at DeFuniak Spring schools.\n\nThe 34-year-old Thompson moved to Tallahassee, rallied the community to help outfit the unit and recruited 89 \"students interested in learning how to play band instruments.\"\n\nThomas designed the Redcoats uniform in the style of the West Point Military Academy, substituting a rich red for West Point gray – and placed an order with the Fitchheimer Company, West Point’s supplier.\n\nDuring the 1940s, under Thomas’ direction, the Leon High School Marching Redcoats became one of the highest rated and most well-traveled bands in the state.\n\n“Of course, we had the finest students you ever saw, absolutely outstanding. There was no reason it couldn’t be a great success,” Thompson said at the 50th reunion/anniversary of Leon’s first band.\n\nThompson's leadership style, enthusiasm, and success both in Crestview and Tallahassee drew comparisons to Professor Harold Hill from the musical “The Music Man.”\n\nAt both locales, he had a band ready to march in parades and entertain at halftime of football games.\n\nThe Redcoats performance at the Northwest Florida Music Festival in the mid-1940s led a judge from Northwestern University to proclaim “I have never seen a more ingeniously planned performance on the field. This performance would be a sensation at any contest in the United States.\"\n\nThompson stayed at Leon until 1950 when he accepted the band director position for Jefferson County High.\n\nIn 2000, the state honored Thompson as a Great Floridian and installed a plaque at Leon High School at Meridian Road.\n\nLydia Smith (circa 1820- 1885)\n\nLydia Stout was the free, well-educated mulatto cousin of George Proctor son of Antonio, a scout on the mission to find a location for a state Capitol. Sometime in the 1840s, George persuaded Lydia to leave the Bahamas and come to Tallahassee and be the governess for six children.\n\nJohn Proctor told the Federal Writers’ project his father George set off to California to look for gold and Lydia apparently came to town to help his mom Nancy.\n\nOnce here Lydia would marry the Rev. James Smith.\n\nLydia and James would embark on careers in teaching; they opened two schools. And the couple did missionary work through the Methodist Church in post-war Tallahassee.\n\nHistorian Lee Warner in \"Free Men in the Age of Servitude,\" a three-generation account of the Proctor family, finds an 1850s Floridian editorial by Charles Dykes that praised Lydia's teaching skills and called on the community to encourage this “well-known colored lady” in her church work.\n\nWarner is convinced that Lydia also was the subject of a Freedmen’s Bureau inspector’s 1865 report from Tallahassee that described a school of “interesting girls” with a “mulatto woman of education,” who announced she intended “to make ladies of these girls.”\n\nThe Smiths would open a school known as The Academy in post-war Tallahassee with about 100 students.\n\nTheir last known residence was 314 West Park Avenue.\n\nBill Peterson (1920 - 1993)\n\nA Toronto, Ohio native, Bill Peterson coached FSU football from 1960 through 1970. He inherited a club that went 4 – 6 before his arrival and 3-6-1 in his first season.\n\nPeterson then introduced the country to FSU football. He recorded the program's first victory over the University of Florida in 1964, beat an until-then-undefeated and top-ranked Kentucky, and had a breakthrough season in 1967 for a football program that began playing in 1948.\n\nThe Seminoles went 7-2-2 that year with stunning performances against Joe Paterno's Penn State University and blue-blood programs like Texas A&M, and the University of Florida – again.\n\nBefore the largest television audience the team had ever performed, the Seminoles fought the Nittany Lions to a 17 – 17 tie in the Gator Bowl.\n\nSeminole faithful say that day on Dec. 30, 1967, FSU, the football team and the university, landed on the national stage.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers offered Peterson a job.\n\nHe turned down the NFL, telling the Tallahassee Democrat his family liked Tallahassee and it was a good place to bring up children.\n\n“I’m going to stay right here and work toward one more objective – a national championship for FSU,” Peterson said.\n\nThe newspaper responded with an editorial that “Coach Pete already is number one in the eyes of Tallahassee.\"\n\nWill Peterson, a grandson, said the coach uncharacteristically clipped and saved the piece.\n\nHe also signed FSU's first Black football player. He hired Bobby Bowden as an assistant, he introduced a pro-type passing game to college football, and he posted a 60% winning percentage.\n\nTwelve of his former assistants went on to become head coaches, including Super Bowl winners Joe Gibbs, and Bill Parcells – and two-time NCAA National Championship coach Bobby Bowden.\n\nAnd there are the Petersonisms that delighted Tallahassee.\n\nOne day he told his players “to line up alphabetically by height” for photos. Another time he announced to friends that, “The greatest thing just happened. I got indicted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame.”\n\nPeterson's relationship with the city was such that when Will did a search of the Tallahassee Democrat 1960 archives Coach Bill Peterson was mentioned more times than governors Claude Kirk, Leroy Collins, and Farris Bryant.\n\nAt his passing, legendary sportswriter Steve Ellis wrote Peterson is “one of the single most significant contributors to the success of Florida State Athletics.”\n\nSharyn Heiland Shields (1946 - 2023)\n\nAtlantic City native Sharyn Shields earned a Master of Arts in dance at Florida State University. She met her husband John, taught at Tallahassee Community College, the University of Florida and Hunter’s College in New York, and then returned to Tallahassee where she became a fervent scholar of archaeology.\n\nShields worked as a Historic Preservation Grants supervisor for the state of Florida, and as an exhibit manager for the Institute of World War II in the FSU history department.\n\nWhile a FSU masters student, Shields began to research Benjamin Chaires' Verdura plantation, which was in east Leon County. Her thesis provided the first historical overview of the three-story, 15-room, 10 column mansion that sat on a 9,000 acres farm maintained by 300 enslaved people.\n\nThe thesis led to \"Whispers from Verdura: The Lost Legacy of Benjamin Chaires,\" published in 2015.\n\nChaires had brought the railroad to Tallahassee, established the city’s first bank, and was a delegate to the Florida Constitution Convention. He died in 1838.\n\nAfter the Civil War, through mismanagement and family scandal his heirs lost the plantation. The mansion burned in the 1880s; only rubble and a couple of columns remain today, along with Shields' account.\n\nTallahassee Community College history professor Bob Holladay said 20 years of research enabled Shields to illustrate “the grandeur of the Old South, the horror of slavery that accompanied it, and the ultimate tragedy of hubris that befell it.”\n\nNathaniel (1932 – 2000) and Julian “Cannonball” Adderley (1928 - 1975)\n\nJulian Edwin Adderley and older brother Nathaniel Carlyle were the sons of Florida A&M University professors who grew up to be Florida’s music ambassadors to the world. In middle school, Nat and Julian played for what would become the FAMU Marching 100, and in high school they jammed with Ray Charles in Tallahassee night clubs.\n\nAfter college and military service the brothers moved on to New York City in the 1950s and became international jazz legends.\n\nTrumpeter Nat joined the Woody Herman sextet, Julian, a saxophonist known as “Cannonball,” landed with the Miles Davis sextet.\n\nThe two also formed The Cannonball Adderley Quintet, and in 1960 scored a national hit with the “Work Song,” inspired by a chain gang at work on Tallahassee’s Pensacola Street.\n\n“They used convict labor to pave the street.

Sealey arrived in Tallahassee from Fort Myers in 1916 to become principal of Leon High School and over the next 12 years would shape the course of Florida public education for much of the 20th century.\n\n“Few men have had such an overwhelming and beneficial impact on a city [Tallahassee] in such a short amount of time,” Florida State College of Women President Edward Conradi wrote upon Sealey’s death in 1928. “His accomplishments as both a leader and a friend are truly unparalleled.”\n\nIn Fort Myers, Sealey led the Gwynne Institute and had solicited Thomas Edison and Henry Ford as supporters to build that city’s first high school.

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/31/synagogue-fight-celebrity-burglaries-fast-food-workers-news-around-states/50663237/", "title": "Synagogue fight, celebrity burglaries: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Corrections officials apparently botched an inmate’s execution last month, an anti-death penalty group alleges, citing the length of time that passed before the prisoner received the lethal injection and a private autopsy indicating his arm may have been cut to find a vein. Joe Nathan James Jr. was put to death July 28 for the 1994 shooting death of his former girlfriend. The execution was carried out more than three hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request for a stay. “Subjecting a prisoner to three hours of pain and suffering is the definition of cruel and unusual punishment,” Maya Foa, director of Reprieve US Forensic Justice Initiative, a human rights group that opposes the death penalty, said in a statement. “States cannot continue to pretend that the abhorrent practice of lethal injection is in any way humane.” The Alabama Department of Forensic Science declined a request to release the state’s autopsy of James, citing an ongoing review that happens after every execution. Officials have not responded to requests for comment on the private autopsy, which was first reported by The Atlantic. At the time of the execution, Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm told reporters that “nothing out of the ordinary” happened. Hamm said he wasn’t aware of the prisoner fighting or resisting officers. The state later acknowledged that the execution was delayed because of difficulties establishing an intravenous line but did not specify how long it took.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Police in the city are trying to get DNA samples from people with certain past convictions to help fulfill the governor’s push to reduce a backlog of missing evidence across the state, Alaska Public Media reports. The ACLU of Alaska has raised concerns about DNA collection efforts and said it’s monitoring the situation.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democratic attorney general candidate Kris Mayes is calling to investigate and potentially cancel the leases the State Land Department signed with a Saudi Arabian company that is pumping from Phoenix’s backup water supply in western Arizona. Mayes is also calling for the company to pay the state approximately $38 million for using the water in La Paz County, which sits in a basin that could be tapped as future water source for the Phoenix metro area. Mayes said the leases should be put on hold while they are investigated because they potentially violate the Arizona Constitution’s gift clause, as well as a clause that requires state land and its products to be appraised and offered at their true value. The Arizona State Land Department gave a sweet deal to a Saudi Arabian company called Fondomonte to farm areas in Butler Valley near Bouse, growing alfalfa to ship it back to the Middle East to feed its cows. Fondomonte pays only $25 per acre annually, which is about one-sixth of the market price for farm land in that area, according to experts and the state’s own mass appraisal for areas in and around Butler Valley. In addition, the water that is being pumped by Fondomonte is located in what’s called a transfer basin, meaning water sucked from the ground can be shipped to areas of the state where groundwater is regulated.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A man who was beaten and held down by law enforcement officers during an arrest that was caught on a widely circulated video has filed a federal lawsuit against the officers. Attorneys for Randal Worcester filed the lawsuit Monday over the Aug. 21 arrest outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry that’s prompted state and federal criminal investigations. A bystander’s video shows one officer hold Worcester down as a sheriff’s deputy repeatedly punches and knees the 27-year-old man in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. At the same time, a third officer also kneed Worcester repeatedly. All three officers – Mulberry Officer Thell Riddle and Crawford County deputies Zachary King and Levi White – are white. Worcester is also white, according to jail booking information. Worcester’s lawsuit accuses the officers, all of whom have been suspended, of violating his constitutional rights. The lawsuit also names the city of Mulberry, its police chief, Crawford County and its sheriff as defendants. “Any reasonable law enforcement officer should have known that his conduct violated clearly established federal law and was a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” the lawsuit said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers on Monday approved a nation-leading measure that would give more than a half-million fast food workers more power and protections, over the objections of restaurant owners who warn it would drive up consumers’ costs. The bill will create a new 10-member Fast Food Council with equal numbers of workers’ delegates and employers’ representatives, along with two state officials, empowered to set minimum standards for wages, hours and working conditions in California. A late amendment would cap any minimum wage increase for fast food workers at chains with more than 100 restaurants at $22 an hour next year, compared to the statewide minimum of $15.50 an hour, with cost of living increases thereafter. “We made history today,” said Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry, calling it “a watershed moment.” “This legislation is a huge step forward for workers in California and all across the country,” she said as advocates offered it as a model for other states. The Senate approved the measure on a 21-12 vote, over bipartisan opposition. Hours later the Assembly sent it to Gov. Gavin Newsom on a final 41-16 vote, both chambers acting with no votes to spare.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two minors and an adult face charges after a teenager was fatally shot in the head while filming a video for the popular social media platform TikTok earlier this month. Three minors were filming dance videos to post on TikTok in the southern Colorado town of Monte Vista when a Glock 19 pistol discharged Aug. 7, according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by KRDO-TV. The victim’s identity has not been released. Emiliano Vargas, 21, has been arrested for allegedly permitting or providing a minor with a firearm. The two other minors who were at the scene were arrested for alleged reckless manslaughter and possession of a handgun by juveniles, according to a statement by the Monte Vista Police Department. According to the affidavit, one of the minors told police that she saw the other juvenile point and shoot the gun at the victim before throwing the pistol on a nearby bed. When asked if it seemed like an accident, the girl said to police that “it could be.” Vargas told police he was not at the scene when the shot was fired, according to the affidavit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: A high school assistant principal this month was charged with bringing a handgun onto campus – more than a year after the incident occurred and three months after state police were directed to reopen the case. Rolando Navarro, 43, was charged Aug. 16 with possession of a weapon on school grounds, a felony, and released on a $1,000 non-surety bond pending his scheduled arraignment Wednesday at Danielson Superior Court, according to a state police criminal information summary. Navarro and Principal Rafael Calixto were placed on administrative leave in February, weeks after the state Department of Children and Families and state police announced an investigation into a report of a gun discovered at Harvard H. Ellis Technical High School last year. State police from the Central District Major Crime Squad in August interviewed a former student who said he was tasked June 8, 2021, with performing a tire rotation on Navarro’s personal vehicle inside the school’s automotive shop. The student and his shop teacher said they found a gun box in the vehicle’s rear tire well containing an unloaded semi-automatic pistol and magazine. Soon after the weapon was reported, Navarro retrieved the gun box and left, police said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State health officials announced Monday that they will soon include fentanyl test strips in naloxone overdose-reversal kits distributed to the public. The effort is aimed at preventing accidental overdoses due to fentanyl consumption, the Division of Public Health’s Office of Health Crisis Response said in a news release. Fentanyl is now the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in Delaware, found in more than 80% of fatal overdoses, officials said. There were 515 overdose deaths in Delaware last year, an increase of 15% from 2020, according to Division of Forensic Science data. Fentanyl was found in 83% of those deaths. The test strips are highly sensitive, and marijuana, cocaine, meth, ecstasy and other substances can be tested for the presence of fentanyl, officials said. Most overdoses are unintentional, officials said, and people may not realize how strong a drug is or that it contains fentanyl, which cannot be detected by sight, taste, smell or touch. The Division of Public Health also distributes 10-pack fentanyl test strip kits through a free mail-order program.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: During her show at The Anthem concert hall Monday, New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde caused a stir by telling the crowd she swam in the Potomac River, WUSA-TV reports. “The crowd is in SHAMBLES,” concertgoer Natalie Escobar said in a tweet. Escobar said the Grammy-winning artist told fans she did it to get a feel for D.C. Another Lorde fan said many in the venue booed. In video from the show, Lorde says she was lying in the river contemplating what to say to the crowd. “I love swimming in water where I’m playing,” said Lorde, 25. “It makes me feel like I know you a bit better.” The reaction on social media has been mixed. “She did what?!” one user wrote. Another joked that the musician is going to grow an extra limb. Others praised her gutsiness. Earlier this year, local leaders celebrated the progress made in cleaning the Potomac. “I think a lot of people still think that this river is not clean enough to swim, but we’ve been doing the testing for three straight years, every single week,” Potomac Riverkeeper Dean Naujoks said back in March. “And we’re finding that there’s plenty of days, and a lot of places more than 85% of the time, where it is safe to swim in this river. I swim in this river; my daughter swims in this river.” Swimming in the Potomac without a permit has been banned since 1932.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Four school board members appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in one of the state’s most Democratic counties were sworn into office Tuesday. They replace the elected Broward County board members DeSantis suspended after a grand jury investigating the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School found widespread wrongdoing. The Florida Department of Education on Monday voiced “significant concerns” about the school system’s actions before, during and after the shootings of 17 people by Nikolas Cruz, a troubled former student who attacked the high school’s campus on Valentine’s Day in 2018. In a letter sent to Superintendent Vickie Cartwright, the state cited the grand jury’s finding of mismanagement of the $800 million voter-approved bond to renovate schools, the underreporting of criminal activity to the state, the district’s “almost fanatical desire to control student data” and use it to manipulate public perception, and the practice of allowing students with serious felonies back on school campuses. “Due to the gravity of the issues outlined above, the Florida Department of Education and the Office of Safe Schools will contact you to arrange an in-person meeting this week to investigate these major concerns,” wrote Tim Hay, who directs the state’s Office of Safe Schools.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A prosecutor on Monday announced a sprawling indictment against members of what she said is a violent street gang that has been targeting the Atlanta-area homes of famous athletes, entertainers and others who flaunt expensive possessions on social media. Singer Mariah Carey, Marlo Hampton of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” Atlanta United player Brad Guzan and the Atlanta Falcons’ Calvin Ridley all had their homes broken into, the indictment says. The 220-count indictment filed Aug. 22 charges 26 people, most of whom are accused of violating Georgia’s anti-gang and racketeering laws. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said the crimes alleged in the indictment – carjacking, kidnapping, armed robbery, shootings, home invasions – were committed by members of the Drug Rich gang, which she said began to emerge in 2016 in a neighboring county. In addition to the celebrity targets, social media influencers were also victimized in home invasions and burglaries, Willis said. “What they do is target people who show their wealth on social media,” she said. “So I do have a message for the public: Where it is kind of fun to put your things on social media and show off, unfortunately these gangs are becoming more savvy, more sophisticated in the way that they target you.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii State Capitol remained closed Monday after a power outage over the weekend. On Saturday morning, one of three high-voltage circuit breakers at the Capitol shorted, officials said. The cause is unknown. The Department of Accounting and General Services has been working with contractors to restore power as soon as possible, officials said in a statement Monday. Until the damaged equipment is repaired, the downtown Honolulu building will remain closed. The Hawaii Legislature adjourned in May. The 2023 session starts in January.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho wants to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm in south-central Idaho, the geographical heart of the sector. University President Scott Green and school officials said in a presentation to Gov. Brad Little and other members of the Idaho Land Board this month that the proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment will help support growth of the dairy and other industries. “CAFE will be a leader (for) water usage and environmental quality challenges while supporting the continued growth of the dairy, livestock, cropland and food processing industries,” Green told the board. The dairy industry is Idaho’s top agricultural sector and ranks third in the nation behind California and Wisconsin. Idaho’s main dairy products are milk, cheese and yogurt. The school wants the Land Board to use $23 million from the 2021 sale of 282 acres, in Caldwell, of endowment land benefitting the University of Idaho’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in Minidoka County north of Rupert. The $23 million is in a fund controlled by the Land Board. The presentation was informational, and the board is expected to take action on the plan in September.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A federal judge sentenced a man to 55 years in prison Monday for the shooting death of a deputy U.S. marshal serving an arrest warrant for a series of downstate burglaries. U.S. District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly imposed the sentence on Floyd E. Brown, 43, of Springfield, for his April 8 conviction on charges of second-degree murder of a federal officer, attempting to kill additional federal officers, assault of federal officers and multiple firearm counts. Brown was acquitted of first-degree murder. Special Deputy U.S. Marshal Jacob Keltner, 35, was a McHenry County deputy working with a Marshal’s Service fugitive task force when he was killed March 7, 2019, at a Rockford hotel. When task force officers attempted to gain access to Brown’s third-floor hotel room, he fired 10 shots through the door and nearby walls, narrowly missing three deputy marshals, U.S. Attorney John Lausch said. Brown then jumped out a window and fired a shot that killed Keltner, who was positioned outside. Brown was arrested several hours later near Lincoln after a high-speed pursuit.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Abortion clinic operators filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block the state’s near-total ban on abortions. The lawsuit filed in a Monroe County court claims the ban, set to take effect Sept. 15, “strips away the fundamental rights of people seeking abortion care” in violation of the Indiana Constitution. It argues the law “will infringe on Hoosiers’ right to privacy, violate Indiana’s guarantee of equal privileges and immunities, and includes unconstitutionally vague language.” Indiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature approved the tighter abortion restrictions Aug. 5, making it the first state to do so since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections for abortions by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The Indiana law includes exceptions, allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest within 10 weeks of fertilization; to protect the life and physical health of the mother; and if a fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. Under the law, abortions can be performed only in hospitals or outpatient centers owned by hospitals, meaning all abortion clinics would lose their licenses. Any doctors found to have performed an illegal abortion would be stripped of their state medical licenses and could face felony criminal charges punishable by up to six years in prison.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Police are investigating a burglary from some unusual victims – endangered primates. Bonobos are considered humanity’s closest living animal relative, and a wooded research site in southeast Des Moines is home to seven of them out of only 250 alive in captivity. On Saturday morning, a staff member at the Ape Initiative reported an overnight burglary to Des Moines police. According to the organization’s Facebook page, the burglars did extensive damage and took a “considerable amount of tools and equipment that we use every day to keep the bonobos safe and healthy.” The investigation is active, and neither the group nor Sgt. Paul Parizek, the Des Moines Police Department’s spokesman, could share specifics of what was taken or how burglars gained access. Neither the bonobos nor the institute’s human staff were put at risk, and the animals remained safe, said Jared Taglialatela, the group’s director. The bonobos seem to be unaffected, Taglialatela said. As for the reported break-in, he said none of the scientific equipment or data on site was taken. Staff are now working on cleanup, repairs and paperwork, away from their normal responsibilities.\n\nKansas\n\nBurlington: Builders of a proposed electric line taking nuclear energy from Kansas to Missouri now have eminent domain power, but they will have to wait to use it until the final route is approved. Regulators say electricity consumers in the state will be better off in the long run from cost savings, despite having to help foot the bill for sending Kansas-produced electricity out of state. The Kansas Corporation Commission granted public utility status to NextEra Energy Transmission Southwest, which plans to build a 94-mile, 345-kilovolt transmission line from the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant, near Burlington, to the Blackberry Substation in Missouri, north of Joplin. Now that NextEra has a certificate of convenience and necessity, it has eminent domain powers. But it can’t use them until it gets approval for the route, expected to run through Coffey, Anderson, Allen, Bourbon and Crawford counties. Instead of a longer route following highways in southeast Kansas, the proposal crosses large swaths of farmland, making it a shorter distance to the station. Several landowners objected to the power lines, which would require a 150-foot easement, during the regulatory proceedings. Anderson County farmer Mike Welding testified that he has no intention of allowing NextEra agents onto his property or to sign the easement contract.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state has received a $5million federal grant to help prevent wrong-way crashes on interstates, officials said. The funding will go toward implementing a pilot program that will use new technology to detect when someone goes the wrong way and then alert the wrong-way driver, other drivers and emergency responders, according to a statement Monday from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. “Wrong-way driving is a major safety challenge,” Gov. Andy Beshear said. “These funds will allow us to use innovative video technology to help monitor and bolster safety on corridors prone to these types of incidents.” Kentucky’s Wrong Way Driving and Integrated Safety Technology System will include digital and roadway signs, cameras and sensors. Locations in Fayette and Jefferson counties – home to Lexington and Louisville, respectively – will be chosen based on crash history and interstate ramp designs, and the system could expand into other counties, officials said. “In addition to implementing this new technological system, we’ll continue researching statewide opportunities to address wrong-way crashes, such as striping and signage,” Transportation Secretary Jim Gray said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly 100 calls to report rapes this year have been quickly downgraded from emergency status, leaving survivors to wait hours for police – and, increasingly, to leave before officers arrive, a New Orleans newspaper and TV station report. The change is highlighted in a report that City Council crime analyst Jeff Asher plans to present to the council this week, WWL-TV and The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate report. Other serious crimes, including armed robberies, carjackings, aggravated assaults and domestic disturbances, are also often being shifted from high to low priority before police arrive, Asher wrote. Advocates and officials are worried that the long waits raise the emotional cost for rape survivors and the chance that the reports won’t be investigated. The changes come at a time when the department has fallen from 1,300 officers to about 950. The reasons are not clear, but authorities appear to be trying to keep lights-and-siren treatment for still-unfolding emergencies, the news agencies report. So far this year, 98 aggravated rape reports – 40% of the total – have been reclassified from emergencies to nonemergencies while the call was being dispatched. The same happened with 1,486 domestic disturbances, 431 domestic batteries, 252 aggravated assaults and 74 armed robberies or carjackings, Asher wrote.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Parents of children enrolled in religious schools fought for years – all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court – for the state to treat tuition reimbursements the same as other private schools. But only one of the religious high schools that stood to benefit has signed up to participate this fall, after Maine’s attorney general warned that the schools would have to abide by state anti-discrimination laws, including those that protect LGBTQ students and faculty. That development has frustrated the families who sued. “Their hands are tied. The state said you can take the money, but we’ll tie your hands,” said David Carson, whose daughter was a sophomore at Bangor Christian Schools when his family and two other plaintiffs sued in 2018. The Supreme Court ruled in June that Maine can’t exclude religious schools from a program that offers tuition for private education in rural towns where there are no public schools. Last year, 29 private schools participated in the tuition reimbursement program, enrolling more than 4,500 students, officials said. Those schools that meet the state’s criteria can get about $12,000 per student in taxpayer funding. So far, only one religious school has signed up to participate, and that application will go through a review process, said Marcus Mrowka, a state education spokesperson. Mrowka declined to identify the school. The deadline for applications is Thursday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Eva Cassidy may be the most famous musical artist ever to live in Annapolis, but it took 26 years and a mural dedication for the city to mount a tribute concert in her honor. Cassidy died in 1996 of metastatic melanoma. She was 33, beloved locally, with one solo album and countless gigs at Annapolis bars to her name. That album, “Live at Blues Alley,” has since sold more than 12 million copies, landing atop record sales charts around the world. No other artist who spent her recording career in the Washington area has enjoyed that level of success, with the caveat that Cassidy did not live to see it, the Capital Gazette reports. “That’s the thing about Eva: All of her success was posthumous,“ said fan Doug Gibson, who attended the recent dedication along with his girlfriend, an artist who knew Eva Cassidy through Annapolis art circles. Acquaintances, co-workers, friends, family, bandmates, roommates and even ex-boyfriends all were among the crowd of several hundred who attended the official dedication of “Maryland Songbird,” a portrait of Eva Cassidy painted on the rear of a Cathedral Street building in Annapolis. The mural was created by artists Jeff Huntington and Julia Gibb with help from local students and supported by their nonprofit Future History Now. More than 30 musicians performed at a tribute concert in the Eva Cassidy Lot.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The Worcester Housing Authority held a groundbreaking Monday for “A Place to Live,” a $7.7 million, 24-unit building that will provide permanent, supportive housing and wraparound care for people experiencing homelessness. “This will not only help people to achieve long-term housing,” Alex Corrales, executive director of the WHA, said during the ceremony Monday morning at the building site. “It will improve residents’ wellness.” The building is the first of its kind in the state and is based on the “A Place to Live” model first developed by the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance. The model offers permanent, supportive, micro-housing units for those who have been chronically homeless. The three-story, 13,340-square-foot building will include 24 fully furnished studio apartments – two of which are wheelchair accessible – as well as a unit for a resident manager and space for group meetings and individual meetings with service providers. Residents will be selected through a lottery system. “This is a sacred moment in which we are announcing and groundbreaking a project and, even more than that, a home,” Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said at the ceremony. “This supportive housing is loving and beautiful.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: A judge began hearing evidence Monday to determine if five men will face trial for their alleged roles in a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The proceedings in state court came six days after two men who were described as leaders of the scheme were convicted in federal court. Michael Null, William Null, Eric Molitor and Shawn Fix, all from Michigan, are each charged with providing material support for terrorist acts as well as a gun crime. Brian Higgins, of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, faces the same material support charge. Judge Michael Stepka must decide if there is probable cause to send the men to trial in Antrim County, a low bar at this stage of the case. The county is the location of Whitmer’s Elk Rapids vacation home. Fourteen people – six in federal court, eight in state courts – were arrested in 2020 and charged in relation to the kidnapping plot. Federal authorities said there was support to abduct Whitmer and spark a civil war, known as the “boogaloo, before the 2020 election. It’s a “version of anarchy,” FBI agent Hank Impola testified Monday. The Null brothers, Higgins and Molitor participated in trips to see Whitmer’s home, according to evidence.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Preparing for an unprecedented strike, hundreds of University of Minnesota service workers protested on campus Tuesday to demand an end to what they called poverty wages and abusive employment practices. “It’s shameful that the University of Minnesota has a billion dollars left over at the end of the year, coming off the backs of workers who are homeless and don’t have enough money for food,” Brian Aldes, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 320, said in a statement. “The State of Minnesota, UMN President Joan Gabel, and the Board of Regents need to understand that if our brothers and sisters at the university are forced to strike, the Teamsters are ready to take up this fight, no matter the cost.” The protesting service workers were joined by student and environmental groups, faculty members, community leaders and elected officials, including Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman. Local 320 represents 1,500 workers at UMN who clean buildings, service dormitories, maintain grounds, prepare food, maintain HVAC systems, care for research animals, drive trucks, and perform other activities across the university’s five campuses. Many of the workers are Black, including immigrants from Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and other East African countries.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Hunters have set a new state record after killing a female alligator that measures more than 10 feet long, state wildlife officials said Monday. A pair of hunters killed the gator Sunday on the Pearl River near the Ross Barnett Reservoir northeast of Jackson, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks said in a news release. It measured 10 feet, 2 inches long from head to tail, making it the longest female alligator harvested on record in the state. The catch would have tied a 1984 world record, but that record fell last year after a female alligator taken in Florida measured 10 feet, 6.75 inches, said Ricky Flynt, the department’s alligator program coordinator. Flynt said it’s possible the Mississippi alligator was 75 to 100 years old. The hunting season for alligators in public waters opened Friday and ends Sept. 5.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday reprimanded St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner for mistakes made in the 2018 prosecution of then-Gov. Eric Greitens but agreed with an advisory counsel’s decision that suspension of her law license or disbarment was not merited. The brief ruling from the state High Court echoed a “joint stipulation” agreement reached in April by Gardner and the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In that agreement, Gardner conceded that she failed to produce documents and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers in the criminal case that played a pivotal role in the Republican’s decision to resign in June 2018. The agreement, stating that Gardner’s conduct “was negligent or perhaps reckless, but not intentional,” called for a written reprimand, but it was ultimately up to the Missouri Supreme Court to issue a ruling. In addition to the reprimand for violating rules of professional conduct, the court fined Gardner $750. Messages seeking comment from Gardner’s office weren’t immediately returned. She told the disciplinary panel in April that the mistakes were due to the fast-moving nature of the Greitens case. “Yes, we had a process. But unfortunately, that process came up short,” she said at the time.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities say a man shot two people, killing a woman and seriously injuring her husband, during a weekend altercation at a bar near Glacier National Park. Whisper Dawn Mari Sellars, 28, of Hungry Horse, died at the scene of the shooting outside of the South Fork Saloon in Martin City, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office said. A 40-year-old man from Kila was arrested at the scene and booked into the county jail for suspected deliberate homicide and attempted deliberate homicide. He was due to make an initial appearance Tuesday afternoon in Flathead County Justice Court, officials said. Deputies responded early Saturday morning to a reported shooting at the saloon and found a woman had been killed and a man injured, the sheriff’s office said. Just before the shooting, Sellars and another woman allegedly got into an argument with the suspect after he found them taking pictures in a golf cart that he’d driven to the bar from a nearby party, the Hungry Horse News reports, based on accounts from witnesses. After the suspect pushed Sellars, her husband pushed the suspect, who fell, got up and allegedly started shooting, the newspaper reports. The victims had five children. Martin City has about a population of 460 people and is located about 20 miles northeast of Kalispell.\n\nNebraska\n\nTecumseh: A death row inmate who strangled his cellmate after complaining he talked too much died Monday at the state prison in Tecumseh. Officials said they have not determined how Patrick Schroeder, 45, died. Schroeder died about four years after he was sentenced to death for the strangulation death of his prison cellmate, Terry Berry. Schroeder admitted to killing Berry in 2017, saying his cellmate was too talkative. After Berry’s death, the state paid his family $479,000 to settle a lawsuit that alleged the state was responsible for Berry’s death because officials put in him a cell with Schroeder, who had been convicted of murder in the 2006 killing of a 75-year-old farmer from Pawnee City. Berry, 22, of Scottsbluff, was nearing parole after being convicted of forgery. As is the case whenever an inmate dies in state custody, a grand jury will conduct an investigation of the death.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The historic Sinai Mansion – also called the Howell House – will likely be torn down despite a proposal made last November to move it to a new location on the Truckee River. The Nevada Museum of Art, which owns the 106-year-old building, has started construction on a $60 million, 50,000-foot expansion that requires a commitment to move the house by October. It can be moved anywhere, but it can’t stay where it is next to the museum. “We know people who lived here and who grew up here at the Sinai Mansion – the Howell House – and I can tell you there’d be a lot of broken hearts in this community if this didn’t end up on its feet somewhere else,” museum executive director David Walker said by phone from the Sinai Mansion, where administrative staff are temporarily located during construction. One proposal to save the mansion comes from Reno attorney Nancy Gilbert, who submitted it to the city Nov. 2. Gilbert’s proposal would move the building 1.5 miles from its current spot to a city-owned property that’s been abandoned for over a decade. The plan is supported by the museum, the Historic Reno Preservation Society and the 1200 Riverside Drive Community Association. Gilbert envisions a coffeehouse, restaurant and event space incorporating both old buildings.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: City officials have received a number of complaints from residents about supporters of ex-President Donald Trump who have been appearing regularly at Prescott Park. The complaints have prompted at least two City Council discussions about the issue, an investigation by the city’s Legal Department, and plans to implement more rules about the designated public forum area of the city-owned park that has long been dedicated to freedom of speech and expression. Robert Sullivan, an attorney for the city, said the complaints from citizens started last summer but “have been continuous all summer long” in 2022. He emphasized the group’s First Amendment rights to free speech, but there are questions about rules regarding the park’s designated public forum area. The pro-Trump group has also appeared downtown in front of North Church – a traditional public forum area that has seen countless political speeches, rallies and protests over the years. “We have been led to believe they are in the park nearly every day,” Sullivan said. “There’s a public forum area at Prescott Park in which constitutionally protected speech is not only allowed but encouraged. John McCain announced his candidacy for president in that very same location.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state is using $6.5 million of federal aid to help collect and digitize school blueprints for first responders, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. The American Rescue Plan funds will help the state’s Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness and the state police devise maps for about 1,500 schools public and private schools. An additional 1,500 schools already have such digital graphics available, according to the administration. The maps are critical to help police and other responders react to emergencies in what could be unfamiliar environments, officials say. “With the epidemic of gun violence reaching every part of our communities, including our schools, we offer our families not empty promises, but concrete investments in tools and resources that will keep our students safe,” Murphy said in a statement. The announcement comes nearly a month after Murphy signed legislation requiring the state’s nearly 600 school districts to set up threat assessment teams aimed at stemming any violence in schools. The bill was introduced two days after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting. That measure goes into effect in the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday pardoned six people for convictions ranging from fraud and larceny to burglary and drug trafficking. The pardons represent another round of clemency decisions for the first-term Democratic governor who is seeking reelection. She has pardoned 56 people overall. The governor’s office said nearly all of the pardoned offenses stem from crimes committed a decade or more ago, and all but one involved nonviolent offenses. Among those pardoned was Cynthia Jaramillo, who escaped from serial killer David Parker Ray in 1999. The governor’s office said Jaramillo, who had a drug trafficking conviction on her record, has since dedicated her life to supporting women facing homelessness and addiction. The others were Bridgette Yvette Tabor, Jack Ferguson, Travis Earl Gatling, Randall E. Johnston and Kathleen Woerter. The governor’s pardoning power extends to all crimes committed under state law except for impeachment and treason. A pardon restores certain rights, such as the right to vote and the right to hold public office.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Amid the bright lights and electronic billboards across Times Square, city authorities are posting new signs proclaiming the bustling crossroads a “Gun Free Zone.” The sprawling Manhattan tourist attraction is one of scores of “sensitive” places – including parks, churches and theaters – that will be off limits for guns under a sweeping new state law going into effect Thursday. The measure, passed after a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June expanded gun rights, also sets stringent standards for issuing concealed carry permits. New York is among a half-dozen states that had key provisions of its gun laws invalidated by the high court because of a requirement for applicants to prove they had “proper cause” for a permit. The quickly adopted law, however, has led to confusion and court challenges from gun owners who say it improperly limits their constitutional rights. Under the law, applicants for a concealed carry permit will have to complete 16 hours of classroom training and two hours of live-fire exercises. Ordinary citizens would be prohibited from bringing guns to schools, churches, subways, theaters and amusement parks – among other places deemed “sensitive” by authorities. Applicants also will have to provide a list of social media accounts for the past three years as part of a “character and conduct” review.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley pitched herself Monday as a bridge between law enforcement and the Democratic Party, appealing to moderate voters in one of the nation’s most competitive races for a seat in the narrowly divided chamber. Joined by more than a dozen current and former law enforcement officers at a news conference in Durham, Beasley announced new legislative priorities to strengthen public safety and mend the frayed relationship between her party and the police force. The Democrat committed to working with Republican lawmakers to secure funding for local law enforcement to train officers on deescalation techniques, mindful responses to behavioral health crises and alternatives to using force. She also told sheriffs she would fight for federal funding to help rural departments address officer shortages and the ongoing opioid crisis. With the Senate in a 50-50 deadlock, North Carolina is one of the few states where Democrats have strong potential to flip a seat this November. Beasley, former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, will face off this fall against Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump. Beasley distanced herself Monday from the “defund the police” movement – a progressive push to divest funds from police department budgets and reallocate them to social services and other community resources.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A Fargo police officer was justified in fatally shooting a man at an apartment complex in July, state Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Monday. Wrigley said Officer Adam O’Brien, a more than 10-year veteran of the department, fired his gun at 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown, after Netterville ignored commands of officers and sped out of a garage in a stolen van, narrowly avoiding officers. Netterville suffered a chest wound and died at a hospital several hours later. The shooting came after a citizen report of three “possibly deceased” people in the van, Wrigley said. The men were alive and may have been sleeping in the van. When police arrived, Netterville “failed to company with lawful orders,” he said. Wrigley said the two passengers in the van said they heard police commands and were trying to convince Netterville to comply. Wrigley and Fargo police Chief David Zibolski showed dash and bodycam video of the incident during a press conference in Fargo. Wrigley previously rejected calls to release camera footage of the shooting. O’Brien was placed on paid administrative leave while the case was being reviewed by the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Zibloski said O’Brien will return to full duty Sept. 7.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would not take up an appeal of a $25 million judgment against Oberlin College in a business’ lawsuit claiming it was libeled by the school after a shoplifting incident involving three Black students. The court did not say why it would not hear the appeal. The 9th District Court of Appeals in Akron upheld the judgment in late March. Oberlin College said in a statement that officials are disappointed the high court did not hear the school’s appeal. “The issues raised by this case have been challenging, not only for the parties involved, but for the entire Oberlin community,” the statement said. Store owners Allyn Gibson and his son, David Gibson, sued Oberlin College in November 2017 claiming they had been libeled by the school, and their business had been harmed. The lawsuit was filed a year after David Gibson’s son, also named Allyn, chased and tackled a Black male student he suspected of having stolen a bottle of wine. Two Black female students who were with the male student tried to intervene. All three were arrested and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges. The arrests triggered protests outside Gibson’s Bakery, where flyers were handed out, some by an Oberlin College vice president and dean of students, accusing the Gibsons of being racist.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has reinstated the murder conviction and life sentence of a man featured in the book and television series “The Innocent Man.” The court overturned a lower court decision that said prosecutors and police withheld evidence that could exonerate Tommy Ward, 61, of the 1984 murder of Donna Denice Haraway in Ada. The ruling, dated Friday, said the withheld evidence, which included witness interviews and police reports, had been available to Ward’s defense since 2003 and was not included in Ward’s direct appeal after his 1999 conviction. “Raising the same general categories on post-conviction that one raised on direct appeal, even if the basis is different, will result in a procedural bar,” according to the state court’s opinion. “He’s very disappointed that he’s still in prison for a murder he didn’t commit,” Ward’s attorney, Mark Barrett, said Tuesday. “We are pressing forward… exploring the possibility of going to federal court” with additional appeals. Barrett noted that the appeals court ordered the lower court to consider an additional claim regarding new evidence discovered in 2019. That evidence includes previously undisclosed suspects and whether police provided Ward with information about the victim’s blouse, which prosecutors said he had described.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A federal judge has ruled that the Oregon State Hospital must impose strict limits on the length of time it treats patients accused of crimes who need mental health treatment. Judge Michael W. Mosman’s ruling seeks to ease the psychiatric hospital’s overcrowding, speed up patient admission and stop people waiting for admission from languishing in jail, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Effective immediately, the hospital must release “aid-and-assist” patients accused of misdemeanors within 90 days of admission and those accused of felonies within six months of admission. Aid-and-assist patients are those found by a judge to be unable to participate in their own defense at trial. The judge’s decision overrules an Oregon law that says the hospital can hold an aid-and-assist patient for up to three years, or the maximum amount of time that a person could have been sentenced to prison for their alleged crime, whichever is shorter. Disability Rights Oregon and Metropolitan Public Defenders requested the order after protesting the hospital’s lengthy admission delays. Disability Rights Oregon in 2002 won a court order that required the hospital to admit aid-and-assist patients within seven days so they can begin mental health treatment quickly.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The state may not keep a cache of weapons seized from the parents of a gunman who killed one state trooper and permanently disabled another eight years ago, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. The parents of Eric Frein sued after authorities refused to return 25 rifles, 10 pistols and two shotguns that were taken from their home in September 2014, days after Frein ambushed the troopers outside a state police barracks in the Pocono Mountains. Eugene Michael Frein and Deborah Frein were not charged in their son’s crime – for which he was convicted and sentenced to death – and none of their weapons were used in his deadly late-night assault. The Pike County district attorney, who was named as a defendant in the parents’ suit, had argued that authorities had the right to hold the seized weapons, saying they might be needed as evidence during Eric Frein’s state and federal appeals. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, saying in its ruling Tuesday that state authorities never used Michael and Deborah’s weapons as evidence at their son’s trial and violated the parents’ constitutional rights by holding on to the guns indefinitely.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: A Jewish congregation in New York City has moved to evict Rhode Island congregants who worship at the nation’s oldest synagogue as part of a long-running dispute over control of the historic building. The New York-based Congregation Shearith Israel on Monday filed a motion in state District Court to take control of Touro Synagogue by removing its current tenants, the Newport-based Congregation Jeshuat Israel. Congregation Shearith Israel said in court documents that it sent a notice in October demanding that Congregation Jeshuat Israel leave the premises as of Monday. “CJI, and any others still in possession of the premises, must vacate the premises as of midnight on the termination date,” Shearith Israel wrote. Members of Congregation Jeshuat Israel released a statement Friday saying their goal was to have a long-term lease so the congregation could have the security of knowing they and future generations can continue to worship in the synagogue. They said they are willing to take full responsibility for maintaining the building and maintaining orthodox services, with the hope of expanding the congregation. “Touro Synagogue is our home, and the place where we have worshipped and been the sole caretakers, for almost 140 years,” members of the congregation wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: “Cocky” will now be joined by “The General” at University of South Carolina football games this fall. The school announced Monday that its live, crowing rooster mascot will have a new name going forward. The bird had previously been called “Sir Big Spur,” but a dispute between its old and new owners led to the name change. Neither the university nor the athletic department owned rights to the former name. The rooster has had a perch at football and baseball games at South Carolina the past two decades. “The General” will be alongside human-sized mascot “Cocky” when the Gamecocks open the season against Georgia State on Saturday night. The new name comes from Revolutionary War general Thomas Sumter, who was known as “The Fighting Gamecock.” South Carolina deputy athletic director Eric Nichols said when officials realized they’d have to change the name, it seemed fitting to go back to the Gamecock nickname’s origin. “We know Gamecock fans are passionate about our traditions, and seeing the live mascot at games and other athletics events is something they look forward to,” Nichols said. The athletic department worked with the rooster’s new owners, Beth and Van Clark, in picking a name. The school’s legal department discouraged keeping any part of the old name.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: Avera Health has announced plans to resize its organization, including eliminating jobs, in response to rising expenses. The higher costs for items that include paper products, common medical supplies, software technology and more mean a reduction is coming to the workforce across the Avera network, according to a statement released by the company Monday evening. “We are resizing our organization with an even greater focus on delivering high-quality patient care while redefining our core business focus around patient care. Sadly, this will mean a reduction in our nonclinical workforce across the Avera footprint, restructuring in areas and changes in services,” the statement said. Details were not shared about how many positions are being eliminated or what specific changes are in the works. While Avera is caring for more patients, inflation is a big reason for the change, per the statement. Because of those rising expenses, Avera said it is challenging itself to “be more efficient, focused and creative in looking at health care differently and less expensively, while leveraging innovation.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A South Korean tire manufacturer plans to add almost 400 jobs in a third expansion of its Tennessee operations. The state Department of Economic and Community Development said Hankook Tire & Technology Co. is planning to add the jobs over five years at its Clarksville campus. The company plans to finish a previous expansion to double U.S. production of passenger car and light truck tires. Hankook will invest $612 million in the third expansion, which will add the company’s first U.S. production line of truck and bus radial tires. Tire production at the new phases of the plant is expected to begin in the last quarter of 2024, then reach full capacity by early 2026. The company broke ground on the Tennessee facility in 2014. Hankook has relocated its North American headquarters to Nashville. The new Clarksville expansion will bring the company’s workforce to about 2,300 people across Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The Associated Press and other news organizations are suing local officials after months of refusal to publicly release records related to the May massacre at Robb Elementary School. The lawsuit filed Monday in Uvalde County asks a court to force the city, school district and sheriff’s department to turn over 911 recordings, personnel records and other documents. Newsrooms have requested them under Texas open records laws since a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers May 24. More than three months after one of the deadliest classroom shootings in U.S. history, news organizations have turned to courts in an effort to obtain information and records that Uvalde officials and state police have argued they cannot release because of ongoing investigations. The Texas Attorney General’s Office has also ruled that Uvalde officials cannot withhold all records. Misleading and outright false statements by authorities about the police response in the initial hours and days after the attack on a fourth grade classroom – which lasted more than 70 minutes – have sowed distrust that remains among many Uvalde residents. “The obfuscation and inaction have only prolonged the pain of victims, their families and the community at large, all of whom continue to cry out for transparency regarding the events of that day,” the lawsuit says.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 3,143 new cases. That’s down 11.2% from the previous week’s tally of 3,539 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Utah ranked 46th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. In the latest week coronavirus cases in the United States increased 10.8% from the week before, with 654,873 cases reported. With 0.96% of the country’s population, Utah had 0.48% of the country’s cases in the last week. Across the country, 16 states had more cases in the latest week than they did in the week before. Across Utah, cases fell in five counties, with the best declines in Davis County, with 351 cases from 446 a week earlier; in Salt Lake County, with 1,294 cases from 1,376; and in Utah County, with 470 cases from 512. Within Utah, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in San Juan County with 157 cases per 100,000 per week; Tooele County with 116; and Salt Lake County with 112. The Centers for Disease Control says high levels of community transmission begin at 100 cases per 100,000 per week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state will spend $3million in the coming year to attract more workers, continuing an effort that began in 2019 when the state offered to cover up to $10,000 in moving expenses for people willing to move to the Green Mountain State to work remotely. In 2020, the Legislature added a program offering up to $7,500 in moving expenses to workers who accepted jobs with Vermont companies in targeted positions such as cooks and servers, child care workers, registered nurses, construction laborers, delivery drivers, elementary school teachers and retail salespeople. In 2021, the state offered both incentives again. The $3 million commitment this year comes despite widespread opposition in the Legislature – especially in the state House – and a review by the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office that rejects the conclusions of a third-party study claiming the programs paid for themselves within two years. The review stated, among other things, that the report relied on “unrepresentative and misleading data to derive its most important conclusions.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hazing charges against five former members of a now-expelled Virginia Commonwealth University fraternity in connection with a freshman’s death from alcohol poisoning after a party have been dropped. Six of the 11 former Delta Chi members charged in the death of Adam Oakes, 19, have pleaded guilty or no contest, but a prosecutor in the case declined to say why the charges against the remaining five were dropped last week, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Last year, 11 former members of the fraternity were charged with hazing and seven of them with serving alcohol to a minor. VCU suspended the students, a defense attorney said last year, and the university permanently removed the fraternity from campus. Three of the six who pleaded guilty or no contest are eligible to have their charges dismissed if they meet the terms of their plea agreements. Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Mike Hollomon declined to comment on the dropped charges, citing the open case status of three defendants. Both charges in these cases are misdemeanors and carry no more than a year in jail and a fine of $2,500. None of the six received jail time. The police investigation found Oakes was told to drink a large bottle of whiskey in February 2021, and the freshman from Loudoun County was found dead the next morning.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Members of the Chinook Indian Nation rallied Monday on the steps of a federal building in Seattle to raise awareness for their long fight to get federal recognition. Chairman Tony Johnson, whose tribal name is Naschio, told KNKX Public Radio that his great-great-grandfather and other leaders first hired lawyers to sue for their lands back in the 1890s. Federal recognition would mean access to federal dollars for health care and housing for this group of tribes, which are based in southwestern Washington, particularly Pacific County. The rally was the start of a campaign by Chinook leadership, they said, to pressure U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell to use their influence in Congress to get the Chinook recognized. For a brief time twenty years ago, the Clinton administration recognized the Chinook Indian Nation, but the Bush administration revoked that decision in 2002 after another Indigenous nation in Washington state, the Quinault, appealed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Johnson said during a speech Monday that the Chinook nation, which is made up of five tribes – the Cathlamet, Clatsop, Lower Chinook, Wahkaikum and Willapa – refused to sign a treaty that would force them to lose their land and therefore was never moved to a reservation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two former teacher’s aides have been charged with failing to report the abuse of special needs students at an elementary school, the Kanawha County Prosecutor’s Office said. The charges were announced Monday in connection with a case involving former special education teacher Nancy Boggs, officials told news outlets. Boggs pleaded guilty in May to 10 misdemeanor counts of battery and was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison stemming from incidents in September 2021. The aides were charged under a state law that requires school employees to report to authorities when they have “reasonable cause” to suspect abuse or neglect or witness “conditions that are likely to result in abuse or neglect.” One aide pleaded not guilty during an initial court appearance Monday, and the other postponed the arraignment until her lawyer could be present.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is allocating $90million more in federal pandemic funding for schools. Evers said the funds are aimed at helping school officials recruit and retain teachers, combatting staffing shortages that have emerged since the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020. “Yes, they are federal funds, I understand that, but until there is a (state) budget, we need to make sure that the people that stand behind me can do the good work,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference at Leopold Elementary School in Madison. Evers is a former state superintendent and public school educator. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, both Republicans, did not react to the governor’s plan. Republican candidate for governor Tim Michels, who is challenging Evers in November, said the plan was political. “The fact that self-proclaimed ‘education governor’ Evers needs to make news on education with 70 days until Election Day shows that his anti-parents, pro-special interest education agenda isn’t resonating with Wisconsin voters,” Michels said. “Evers wants his big checks to make people forget his big failures, but his disastrous record speaks for itself.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: At the Jackson Cupboard food bank, Ash Hermanowski oversees the distribution of about 1,200 free meals a day from a commercial garage after being forced from a previous site by a malfunctioning sprinkler. The food bank couldn’t afford any other place in town. Just across the street, The Glenwood, a collection of townhomes that will sell for millions, is nearing completion. “Unparalleled luxury,” its website says, in a “truly relaxing oasis.” It’s the “ultimate irony,” Hermanowski said. “The staff and I, we talk about it all the time. We all struggle to live here, and they’re building high-end residences. That dichotomy exists all over town, but people refuse to see it.” Inflation is particularly high in the town of Jackson and the surrounding Teton County, which, even before the pandemic erupted two years ago, was the wealthiest and most unequal place in the nation. The state of Wyoming has calculated that the cost of living in the county at the end of 2021 was 68% higher than in the rest of the state – with housing costs 130% higher. Roughly 85% of the food bank’s recipients have a job, often more than one, said Sharel Lund, executive director of one22, a nonprofit that includes Jackson Cupboard.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/29/sioux-falls-argus-leader-best-photos-2019-south-dakota/2663985001/", "title": "2019 year in review: The best Argus Leader photographs", "text": "The last 12 months in the Sioux Falls area brought everything from extreme weather, to celebrations to heartaches, and Argus Leader photojournalists were there to capture many moments in our community's history.\n\nIn preparing for the new year, we also take time to look back and reflect on the moments that made 2019 memorable.\n\nHere's a month-by-month look at the year in photos:\n\nOn Jan. 5, Gov. Kristi Noem took her oath of office and made history as the first woman to serve as governor of South Dakota.\n\nHer inauguration drew a packed house at the state Capitol, and in the hour-long ceremony, the 47-year-old former Congresswoman promised to govern with an eye to the future.\n\n\"The North Star that I want to follow with each decision I make as governor is the impact on the next generation. How does this policy, this legislation, this program, impact the next generation of South Dakotans?\" she said in her inauguration speech.\n\n► You couldn't have scripted a better ending to this year's Hanson Classic. With the final shot of the tournament, Ethan junior Carly Van Roekel, who has Down syndrome, hit a two-pointer at the buzzer.\n\nAn Argus Leader investigation in February introduced readers to Nick Johnson, a teen who battles several mental illnesses that have landed him in the Juvenile Detention Center.\n\nSioux Falls and other South Dakota communities rely on jail cells as part of their mental health system, even though national advocacy groups are critical of the practice and local jail officials say their facilities aren’t designed for mental health treatment.\n\nSouth Dakota is one of five states where this procedure, putting people in jail on what's known as an involuntary mental health hold, is an option provided in statute.\n\nThese are people like Johnson, struggling with a diagnosed mental illness. Jailing people for being in crisis criminalizes mental health, traumatizes an already sick person who needs treatment and is a potential violation of their Constitutional due process rights.\n\n► On Feb. 28, Former Sioux Falls Fire Rescue Chief Jim Sideras was given a suspended six-year sentence for child pornography possession, meaning he would not spend time behind bars.\n\nMinnehaha County's then-State's Attorney Aaron McGowan addressed the media following the sentencing. It was the first of many moments in 2019 in which McGowan would make headlines. The 45-year-old resigned in early December amid an investigation that he sexually harassed employees in his office.\n\nThat investigation followed an earlier probe from Attorney General's Office, prompted by the governor, which looked into McGowan's extended absences from work.\n\n► A wild year of weather started out with a stretch of cold worthy of the Night King. From early February to early March, Sioux Falls went more than a month without temperatures above freezing — the longest stretch of the decade.\n\nIn late March, the Big Sioux River hit a \"major\" flood level, and floodwaters hit homes in both Dell Rapids and Renner.\n\nThe water came up so fast that one family of four had to be evacuated from their home.\n\n► A core group of Brandon Valley seniors that had been together since elementary school closed out their high school careers with a 60-40 victory over No. 3 Lincoln in the Class AA state championship game in Rapid City.\n\n\"I've been playing with these girls since we were in fifth grade,\" said guard Trinity Law, who led all scorers with 17 points. \"Being able to win it here with those girls — and some younger girls to show them what this program is all about — it's amazing. It's amazing.\"\n\nA new housing program put together by a housing action team under Sioux Falls Thrive began helping families like Hanah Christman's find stability, meant to give low-income families a stronger chance at overcoming poverty and minimizing high mobility rates for children.\n\nCalled OneRoof, the program partners with mostly private property owners who open their doors to at-risk families willing to partner with a case manager and mentorship program to get back on their feet.\n\n►The Rock Steady Program at the Inn on Westport empowers people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that typically progresses from a tremor in the hand to balance issues and problems with speech.\n\nThe classes of high intensity training are designed to slow down the progression of Parkinson's in the program's 50 boxers.\n\n\"When you step through that door you're an athlete, not a person with Parkinson's,\" coach and program director Lisa Howard said.\n\nMore than 1,500 students from Sioux Falls' four public high schools earned their diplomas on May 26 in ceremonies at the Sioux Falls Arena.\n\n► The Arc of Dreams, a sculpture six years in the making, arrived in Sioux Falls on May 18. The 70-foot tall structure sculpted by Dale Lamphere was built with to celebrate the SculptureWalk and Sioux Falls.\n\nThe full sculpture was installed in June, with a lighting ceremony to dedicate the artwork soon after.\n\n► Josephine Dal clocked an impressive 14.75 on the 100 hurdles at the state track meet in Sioux Falls before transitioning to the field, where she won the long jump (17-11) by .75 inches over Yankton's Jaiden Boomsma. Add in a runner-up finish in the 300 hurdles (44.33) and a strong showing the 4x4, and Dal had a dominating day.\n\nCrowds lined Phillips Avenue on June 15 to watch Sioux Falls' first pride parade, a prelude to the day's Pride in the Park festival.\n\nLocal businesses and organizations showed their support for the city's LGBTQ community during the half-hour parade, which featured dozens of participants and floats.\n\n► The first concert at the Levitt at the Falls concert facility on June 14 was the culmination of nearly a decade of planning, fundraising and construction that led to the transformation of an empty park lawn into a venue expected to draw thousands of visitors to the heart of Sioux Falls each summer.\n\nThe project is a partnership involving the Los Angeles-based National Levitt Foundation, the local nonprofit called Friends of the Levitt that Kirby and former lawmaker Tom Dempster put together and the city’s Parks and Recreation Department.\n\nThe inaugural 2019 lineup was limited to 30 concerts, but the agreement between the foundation and the local non-profit calls for at least free 50 shows a year going forward.\n\n► A team from the state Game, Fish and Parks met in several Sioux Falls parks to perform the annual task of affixing identification bands to the legs of the Canadian geese as a way to track their population numbers, hunting survival rates and migration habits.\n\nSioux Falls police and fire departments teamed up with the city's parks and recreation department to host a weekly Hydrant Block Party in various parks and neighborhoods through mid-August.\n\nThe first block party kicked off at Bakker Park, and the city was already planning more for next summer.\n\n► Jacob Herrboldt, a 26-year-old Tripp native, took up bull-riding competitively this year after the unexpected passing of his brother, Chad Herrboldt.\n\nBefore Chad had passed, the two had made a plan to start riding bulls. Chad was already an accomplished horseman, winning handfuls of competitions in his lifetime, but Jacob was new to the rodeo scene.\n\n\"I think about him a lot,\" Jacob said. \"It's what we wanted to do. I thought I would just go right ahead and do it.\"\n\nJacob has been pushing himself to stay atop for eight seconds, the amount of time a rider must stay on a bull to receive a score.\n\n► A \"Sioux Falls street fight\" was held in parking lot of the Icon Lounge during the Midwest All Pro Wrestling Super Summer Sizzler Series.\n\n\"In a street fight there are no rules,\" said Jonathan Coachman, a former World Wrestling Entertainment personality and ESPN commentator. \"We can and will do anything to win.\"\n\nThe spring flooding coupled with tariffs on foreign ag markets made for a tough year for South Dakota farmers and ranchers. So the Sioux Empire Fair waived entry fees for its livestock show competitions for the first time this summer.\n\n\"This is a great thing we have come up with to kick off the 80th anniversary, and with the hard times with the farmers and ranchers, we want to give them this opportunity,\" said Julie Hammer, administrative assistant for the Sioux Empire Fair.\n\n► The Sioux Falls Airshow came to town mid-August and featured the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds.\n\nThe organizers said they think more people came out to the event this year than ever before.\n\n\"We're pretty confident we set records for attendance,\" said event chair Rick Tupper, who estimated there were well over 100,000 people.\n\n► The Burke football team hosted Lyman in their first game of the season just a couple of weeks after the town had been hit by a tornado.\n\n\"Keep everything in perspective,\" Burke coach Mike Sebern told his players before their customary walk to the field. \"Football isn't more important than community. It's not more important than life. But this is an opportunity for us to heal as a community. The people out there, they're waiting for you.\"\n\nAs the players lined up outside their makeshift locker room at the town's fire station, the heavily damaged high school was visible down the road. This was the same pregame tradition the Cougars have carried on for decades, just with a different route.\n\nThree EF-2 tornadoes packing winds of 130 miles per hour caused significant damage to the Western Mall area of Sioux Falls along 41st Street, the Avera Health complex and a residential neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city on Sept. 10.\n\nThe tornadoes caused significant damage to businesses and residences — 37 in all, officials said — and left eight injured, but none of those were serious, Mayor Paul TenHaken said.\n\nThe three tornadoes all struck the city within four minutes of each other, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAn EF-2 tornado can be measured by winds between 113-157 mph that cause damage to roofs, houses, large trees being snapped or uprooted and cars being lifted off the ground, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n► Flooding pummeled the town of Madison on Sept. 12.\n\nThe flooding began in north Madison, quickly overtaking bridges and submerging entire roads before flowing south.\n\nSome parts of town saw anywhere between two to three feet of water, according to Mayor Marshall Dennert, who heard one area reached six feet — enough to cover the tires of a backhoe.\n\n\"There was really no way to prepare for this,\" Dennert said.\n\n► In the last year, Siouxland Library officials have been focused on finding new ways to captivate young readers and learners by reaching them before they get to kindergarten.\n\nAnd the best way to make that happen is by breaking social norms and making libraries engaging, fun and loud.\n\n► With players representing (at least) 11 different countries and multiple foreign languages, the Washington boys soccer team is defined, at least in part, by its diversity.\n\nIt's representative of Washington High School, but it has also created some of the challenges this team has had to overcome. Though brought together by a shared passion for the game, the unification of the Warriors has been a two-year process, with players learning to play together as a team and, in some instances, speak the same language.\n\nThe Warriors lost to Roosevelt 1-0 in the championship.\n\nJeff Thompson would normally have three-fourths of his soybeans harvested by the beginning of October. This year, he began harvesting on Oct. 7.\n\nBut it's more than the crops that have Thompson on edge. It's the tough crop prices and trade problems with China and the carryover soybeans he's still holding from last year. A lot of soybean farmers are in the same boat, said Thompson, president of the South Dakota Soybean Association.\n\n\"It's not just a South Dakota issue, it's a Midwest issue,\" he said. \"It goes down to Missouri, up to Illinois, North Dakota. It's such a huge area that's just been so messed up with the weather conditions.\"\n\nFarmers were prevented from planting 19.4 million acres of crops nationwide, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency. That's 17.5 million acres more than last year and the highest number of prevented plant acres since the USDA established the program in the 1990s, said U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Bill Northey, a former Iowa agriculture secretary from Spirit Lake east of Sioux Falls.\n\n► Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium, the South Dakota State campus and Brookings became ground zero for the college football world in late October when ESPN’s wildly popular college football pregame show/tailgate party ‘College Gameday’ made the trip to broadcast the show live from College Green on the Jackrabbit campus.\n\nESPN brought the show to spotlight the Dakota Marker game with rival and national championship powerhouse North Dakota State, spending much of the week in Brookings to record interviews and feature stories that aired on Saturday’s show. They also broadcast live from the set on Friday for ‘College Football Live’.\n\n► Flooding impacted the pheasant hunting season in South Dakota this year.\n\nThe state saw a 17% decrease compared to last year in its 2019 pheasant brood survey. The number of roosters increased by 2% and the number of hens decreased by 21% from last year, according to a Game, Fish and Parks survey.\n\nSouth Dakota typically has 120,000 pheasant hunters in a year, and officials said no one would have a problem trying to find a hunting spot.\n\n► Britton-Hecla quarterback Trevor Zuelke was hospitalized Oct. 18 after he fell unconscious on the Britton-Hecla bench during the team's final regular-season game at Warner, a few minutes after taking a hit early in the fourth quarter. Zuelke is currently recovering at a hospital in Lincoln, Neb.\n\nThe outpouring of support for Zuehlke and his family has included donations, messages and prayers from seemingly every pocket of South Dakota, as well as Minnesota, North Dakota, Arkansas, Texas, California and Ohio.\n\nThe Expo Building at the W.H. Lyon Fairgrounds was roaring with high-flying dirt bikes in November.\n\nPeterson Racing Promotions brought their Midwest Supercross back to Sioux Falls for their second year with a series of races. Both nights featured the top riders in the Midwest as they competed for cash, trophies and prizes, according to a news release.\n\n► A system dropping 3.5 inches of snow in the Sioux Falls area led to slippery driving conditions and dozens of car crashes Tuesday, Nov. 26, police said.\n\nSioux Falls police officers responded to 58 car crashes between 3 p.m. on Nov. 26 and midnight on Nov. 27, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. Of those crashes, 27 happened during the 5 p.m. rush hour.\n\nThere weren't any serious injuries among the car crashes.\n\n► Charles Russell Rhines, 63, was executed by lethal injection on Nov. 4 for the 1992 murder of Donnivan Schaeffer, 22, at a Rapid City doughnut shop.\n\nSchaeffer's parents and his fiancee at the time of his death spoke to media following the execution.\n\nThey described Schaeffer's \"contagious laugh,\" his willingness to help those in need and that he will be remembered for many things, including being \"the guy who drove that old red pickup,\" said his mother Peggy Schaeffer.\n\n\"Today is a big day, a day marked with sadness and grief but also relief and justice,\" she said. \"But above all today is a day we talk about Donnivan, the boy who loved his family, fiancee and friends, the guy who drove that old red pickup ... He is missed, and he is loved, and he will never be forgotten.\"\n\n►Some four-legged friends have been teaching students to take care of themselves and others for years, serving as therapy dogs in local schools.\n\n► For the first time in 14 years, the O’Gorman football team were state champions.\n\nAcquiring their first state title since they won back-to-back crowns in 2004-05 required the Knights to take out top-seeded Roosevelt in the semifinals then dethrone a Brandon Valley squad that had beaten them 40-16 during the regular season.\n\nThe cochlear implants hit the kitchen counter, and Trey Diedrich started crying.\n\nHis mother, Shawna Diedrich, paused and looked up from the turkey roast she was preparing to see the tears fall from her lanky 12-year-old son's blue eyes.\n\n\"I'm done,\" Trey said using sign language. \"I want to be deaf.\"\n\nHe was done with the implants, which only allowed him to hear about one in every two words said to him.\n\nHe was done being misunderstood by teachers and classmates, done getting in trouble at school for using sign language, done trying to learn without an interpreter, done getting passed along in school despite having only a third-grade reading level.\n\nDone.\n\nAn Argus Leader investigation found South Dakota leaders have ignored the needs of deafand hard of hearing children like Trey Diedrich for decades.\n\nSystematic decisions from lawmakers, educators and state officials left hundreds at risk of falling through cracks in the system and failing to get the free appropriate public education guaranteed to them under federal law.\n\n► Despite making the playoffs, South Dakota State's season, which ended at 8-5, was characterized more by its defeats than victories. Coach John Stiegelmeier said it in his postgame press conference after a 13-10 playoff loss in a rematch with Northern Iowa — his team lost five games by a total of 29 points.\n\nThe Jacks were a deep, veteran team in most areas but relied on freshman quarterbacks to lead them, and in the losses to Minnesota and NDSU in particular, freshman mistakes by those quarterbacks proved costly.\n\n► Sioux Falls has a long list of requirements to legally own pets — and the regulations vary by animal.

If there are any updates, we will inform our stakeholders at the appropriate time.\"\n\nHonda and Nissan have recently increased ties to persist in an EV marketplace fueled by competition from Tesla and Chinese automakers – and stalling demand in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThe companies announced in August they were \"deepening the framework of the strategic partnership\" agreed on in March 2024 to collaborate on research and development – and investments – in new EVs and the software used by next-generation vehicles.\n\n\"Going forward, Nissan and Honda will continue to study ways to create further synergies between the two companies and work toward the speedy implementation of specific measures,\" the companies said.\n\nSeat belt warnings:They will soon be required for rear seats: Here's what to know\n\nHonda and Nissan merger: 'Positioning' for the future\n\nThe merger makes sense, according to Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for auto research and news company Edmunds.\n\n“A merger would be a long-term strategy, not a solution to any short-term challenges either company is facing. Both Nissan and Honda are positioning themselves for the future, which will be defined by electrification and autonomous technology – developments that are extremely costly,\" Caldwell told USA TODAY.\n\nWith the future turning to EVs and self-driving vehicles, \"it’s logical that smaller automakers may need to collaborate to keep pace with larger players, including rising competition from Chinese manufacturers that have entered the market aggressively,\" Caldwell said.\n\nThe two companies may operate under a holding company, Nikkei reported, and are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding soon. A merged company could also eventually include Mitsubishi Motors, of which Nissan owns a 24% stake. Mitsubishi joined the Honda-Nissan initiative on EV and next-gen vehicle development in August.\n\nCollectively, the company would have combined sales of about 8 million annually, making it the third-largest automaking company in the world, Nikkei reported.\n\nThe merger would put the combined automaker in a better competitive position, according to Bloomberg. Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi combined sold about 4 million vehicles worldwide in the first six months of 2024, behind the global leader, Toyota, which sold 5.2 million, Bloomberg said. The number two global automaker, Volkswagen, sold 4.35 million.\n\nElectric vehicles:Is now a good time to switch to an EV?\n\nThe capital-intensive EV business requires billions of dollars in investment for new factories and battery development, said K. Venkatesh Prasad, chief innovation officer at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nFor legacy automakers such as Honda and Nissan, \"it only makes sense to consolidate while you still can to create the volumes you need for cost to be kept low and to be able to design and build premium content capabilities.\"\n\nSecuring a profitable business in traditional vehicles using internal combustion engines \"is a necessary condition to make way for the money needed to build an EV business with a mid-to-long-term business sustainability plan,\" Prasad said.\n\nHonda-Nissan merger could face Trump roadblocks\n\nOther hurdles include the potential rollback of EV-friendly policies by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and merger scrutiny from the Trump Administration.\n\nThe incoming president has vowed to take a hard line on imported vehicles, including 25% tariffs on vehicles shipped from Canada and Mexico. Both companies currently have plants in Mexico and Honda has a plant in Canada.\n\nTrump could seek concessions from Honda and Nissan to approve any deal, auto industry officials said. During his first term, Trump threatened tariffs on Japanese vehicles.\n\nHonda and Nissan also manufacture vehicles in the U.S. Honda has 12 manufacturing plants in the U.S., where it makes automobiles, power equipment and aircraft engines. Nissan, which has three plants in the U.S., announced 9,000 global layoffs last month and a 20% production cut.\n\nContributing: Hadley Hitson, USA TODAY Network, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

FCA has its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills and is planning a massive expansion of its manufacturing operations on Detroit's east side.\n\nPersistent merger talk\n\nThe news of a deal, should it come to pass, would appear to answer the perennial questions about possible merger candidates for FCA. The company has generally been riding high on its decision in recent years to focus, in the United States, on SUV and truck production over traditional cars.\n\nRenault would offer the company a chance to bolster its electric vehicle credentials at a time when that is becoming increasingly important, especially in Europe.\n\nMichelle Krebs, executive analyst with Cox Automotive’s Autotrader, noted the long focus at FCA on the benefits of consolidation.\n\n\"This is something Sergio Marchionne talked about for a long time, that the industry needs to consolidate, that they're wasting a tremendous amount of money\" on each company pursuing technology development, Krebs said, referencing FCA's late CEO.\n\nKrebs noted that both companies have different footprints, and Renault no longer has a presence in the United States, where FCA makes the bulk of its profits from its Jeep and Ram truck brands.\n\nShe also offered words of caution.\n\n\"Both automakers have to tread very carefully. Both have experienced combining of operations that hasn't turned out very well,\" Krebs said. \"While things may look good on paper, (with) complementary operations and footprints ... it often comes down to merging the cultures, and that is a challenging task that is not always successful and both companies have experienced that.\"\n\nMore:Thousands sign up for FCA's Detroit job info; laid-off Illinois workers would get first dibs\n\nMore:Fiat Chrysler names new leadership in China\n\nMore:Fiat Chrysler completes $6.5B sale of Magneti Marelli, which has Michigan operations\n\nKrebs pointed to Chrysler's not-so-equal \"merger of equals\" with Daimler-Benz, which was really an acquisition by the German company, and Renault's current relationship with Nissan and Mitsubishi, which has been under strain following the ouster and criminal charges in Japan against its former head, Carlos Ghosn, who has denied wrongdoing.\n\nHouse of cards?\n\nJon Gabrielsen, a market analyst and auto adviser, was more blunt, saying he does not see anything positive out of such a deal.\n\n“It sounds like the perfect recipe for a house of cards that will inevitably collapse over time. Take the stressed relationship between Renault and Nissan, that is said to have only been held together by the sheer determination and charisma of Carlos (Ghosn). Remove the glue of Carlos (Ghosn), add Mitsubishi then add Fiat Chrysler,\" Gabrielsen said. \"By my count that is a colossus collage, with five distinct company cultures (Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi. Fiat, and original Chrysler) with four principal distinct and very different country cultures (French, Japanese, Italian and American), then overlay an inevitable coming global downturn. Meanwhile I fail to see any benefits at least for the Chrysler portion of the arrangement.”\n\nGabrielsen noted that \"if you cannot get the total cultural organization to dance in perfect harmony, it is irrelevant how brilliant any combination looks on paper for combined financials or combined market coverage and shares. The beast will destroy itself from within.”\n\nHowever, Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, offered a different outlook when the possibility of a tie-up with Renault-Nissan (or France's PSA Group) was raised in April.\n\n\"South America is the one obvious overlap between FCA and either potential partner, but elsewhere ... they would form a powerful team. Renault and Peugeot-Citroen-Opel control Europe much more completely than Fiat/Lancia. Renault-Nissan’s global reach and strength outpaces that of Groupe PSA, but either suitor would make (an) excellent partner for FCA,\" Fiorani told the Free Press then. \"FCA has just a few strong points and many weak areas. Globally, Jeep is the obvious highlight of the FCA family. Ram and the minivans are strong in North America while Fiat holds down South America and Italy.\"\n\nContact Eric D.

We are not at a point of time to discuss any alliance,\" according to a Bloomberg report of Marchionne's comments.\n\nMarchionne had indicated that a merger of the two automakers might be attractive for Volkswagen after PSA Groupe purchased Opel from General Motors in March. Speculation only increased after VW CEO Matthias Muller reportedly said he would not rule out talks with Fiat Chrysler.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nInstead, Marchionne said the two companies are not in talks and he is not seeking a deal with Tesla, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn addition, Reuters noted that Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann said he is \"not interested in a big merger deal.\"\n\nThe possibility of a merger with VW was not the first time Marchionne has talked about a tie-up with another automaker, but he has also said that a merger need not happen during his tenure.

He also is a member of Fiat Chrysler's 21-member executive council that meets regularly to make decisions on the company's biggest issues.\n\nEarlier this year Marchionne stirred up both Wall Street and the global automotive industry when he issued a 25-page report during an earnings conference call called \"Confessions of a Capital Junkie.\"\n\nMarchionne said the automotive industry is wasting billions of years on product development because there are too many automakers making similar cars and trucks with similar engines and other components. Automakers, he said, could save billions per year if some automakers merged with each other.\n\nSince then, Marchionne has become even more aggressive, even though almost every automaker has publicly rejected the idea of a merger now. Media reports have emerged that have said Marchionne has enlisted the support of hedge funds and activist investors to pressure General Motors into considering a merger.\n\nFCA's own controlling shareholder, Exor, is currently recently launched a hostile takeover bid for PartnerRe, one of the world's largest reinsurance companies. Exor is an investment fund based in Turin with about $14.6 billion in assets. It is controlled by the Agnelli family and its Chairman and CEO John Elkann — the same Elkann who is chairman of FCA.\n\nAnd, Reuters said last week that GM and FCA have hired financial advisers to evaluate a potential deal. GM has hired Goldman Sachs and FCA has hired UBS, according to the report.\n\nSince the two companies both have a huge presence in North America, have full product lineups of top-selling pickups and SUVs and have thousands of employees working on similar projects. That means full merger between the two companies would surely lead to painful job cuts.\n\nDespite all of this, Garberding said FCA's management team is able to stay focused on conducting business because they have faith that Marchionne and the company's ownership has the best interests of the company's future in mind.\n\n\"Our leadership, our board, and our owners have been extremely responsible dealing with people and the company over the years and I think that people expect that that will not change,\" he said.\n\nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

The deal, which was signed by Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung and GM CEO Mary Barra, comes about two weeks after GM and South Korea-based Samsung SDI finalized the joint venture they announced a year ago. GM confirmed in that deal the parties are investing $3.5 billion to build an electric vehicle battery plant in northern Indiana.\n\nGM said the potential collaboration with Hyundai could include co-development and production of both passenger and commercial vehicles. It could also include gasoline-powered engines and clean-energy, electric and hydrogen technologies.\n\n“GM and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams,\" Barra said in a statement. \"Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently.\"\n\nThe automakers will also review areas where they can work together for combined sourcing in battery raw materials, steel, and other areas to leverage scale and lower costs.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nAfter signing the nonbinding memorandum of understanding, GM said the companies will assess what projects they can collaborate on and progress toward binding agreements.\n\nMorningstar auto analyst David Whiston said this initial agreement between GM and South Korean-based Hyundai is a way to develop new vehicles that could be cheaper for both parties in terms of the cost of raw materials, shared engineering and manufacturing. He said cost reduction is critical to GM’s success.\n\n“How it turns out is probably still fluid and can change from the original terms, as we’ve seen with GM and Honda’s EV collaboration,” which was ended last year without results, Whiston said. “It’s such a competitive industry, and I think incumbent (automakers) are worried about the rise of Chinese automakers beyond China, so anything you can do to help costs whether its partnerships, job reductions, exiting certain markets, it will be done.”\n\nDan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said a partnership with Hyundai would benefit GM.\n\n“Hyundai is a very strong EV player with global penetration in the U.S. and Korea among other key markets,” Ives told the Detroit Free Press. “This will give GM another path to growth and the partnership makes a ton of strategic sense.”\n\nBut other observers said all of this could have been done without having to sign anything.\n\n\"It sounds like an agreement to talk about possibly doing things they always could talk about possibly doing,\" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. \"They will explore future opportunities to collaborate in a list of potential areas. You don't need an agreement to do that.\"\n\nBut partnerships are a big part of Barra's agenda in recent months. In May, she told investors at a Bernstein's 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference that one of the things that's \"frustrated me in being in this role for 10 years … I think there’s many more opportunities where (automakers) can collaborate and reduce, at a minimum your research and development or your engineering expenses.\"\n\nShe listed, for example, aspects of a vehicle that are important, but not a \"distinguisher.\"\n\n\"I don’t buy a vehicle for its HVAC system,\" Barra said. \"I want it to work: blow cold air at the right amount of time and blow hot air. But I’m not going to compete on that. So internal combustion engines are going to exist around the world for a long period of time, but how do we do that more economically? There are opportunities to partner.”\n\nAt the time, Barra said GM did not have any partnerships to announce, but Barra said the company is \"certainly very open to how we take cost out. I think it'll be an important part of that equation to how we compete globally.\"\n\nHyundai, which makes a mix of cars, SUVs and EVs, reported it sold 214,719 vehicles in the United States during the second quarter, up 2.2% compared with the year-ago quarter. For the first half, the automaker sold 399,523 total vehicles, a 1.2% increase compared with the first half of 2023. It said SUVs comprise three-fourths of its retail sales mix.\n\nBy comparison, for the second quarter, GM reported a gain of 0.6% to 696,086 million vehicles sold. For the first half, GM reported its U.S. new vehicle sales declined 0.4% to 1,290,319 million new vehicles sold.

He said he had not yet spoken with Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne about the topic but that \"it would be very helpful if Mr. Marchionne were to communicate his considerations to me, too, and not just to you.\"\n\nMarchionne has publicly lobbied for auto industry consolidation for years, having previously proposed a deal with General Motors that GM swiftly rejected.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nBut urgency is picking up after GM reached a deal to sell its European division to French automaker PSA Group, which controls the Peugeot brand, potentially translating into stiffer competition for VW in its home market.\n\nIn the U.S., Fiat Chrysler owns the popular and profitable Jeep and Ram brands but is saddled with ailing car-heavy brands Dodge, Chrysler and Fiat.\n\nAs one of the smaller global automakers, Fiat Chrysler may need a deal to navigate a massive increase in technological investment required to keep pace as the industry shifts toward self-driving vehicles, electric cars and ride-sharing business models.\n\nBut that doesn't mean a deal makes sense for Volkswagen, Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\n\"They have a lot on their plate as it is,\" Krebs said. \"It’s clear that Volkswagen needs to focus on profitability and getting the most out of their brands and recovering from the crisis it’s been in.\"\n\nA Fiat Chrysler spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nVolkswagen spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan said in an email that \"there are no plans and have been no discussions\" between the two companies.\n\nPotentially complicating matters is the rivalry between VW and Fiat Chrysler.

Fiat is holding a shareholder meeting on Aug. 1 for shareholders to approve transactions related to that proposal. Fiat and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne has said he hopes to have the stock of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles listed on the New York Stock Exchange by Oct. 1.\n\nMax Warburton, an analyst for Sanford Bernstein, said in a research report Thursday that a merger between Volkswagen and Fiat has some logic to it but doubts that the families that control the two companies could come to an agreement or that European anti-trust officials would approve it.\n\n\"A deal may just be a fantasy that will never be realized, but the acquisition of Fiat-Chrysler does have some potential logic for VW in our view, Warburton said. \"Piech isn't getting any younger, wants to run the world's largest automaker and loves premium brands.

Even though the marriage appears to be off, the reasons that led to talks in the first place haven’t changed, so there could be more news to come.\n\nWhat's next for FCA?\n\nThat depends on whether this was really the end of talks. Renault said it was delaying a vote after two days of board discussion on the proposal from FCA for a 50-50 merger. FCA almost immediately announced it was withdrawing the offer.\n\nMichelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive’s Autotrader, was skeptical. “I find it hard to believe that FCA and (FCA Chairman John) Elkann, in particular, hadn’t read the political tea leaves before, so I wonder if that is really the full story and is it something that can be overcome,” she said.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nErik Gordon, law professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said he wouldn’t be surprised if they try again, suggesting it could be a negotiating ploy. Elkann in a letter to employees, however, said it had become clear discussions had been taken as far as they could reasonably go.\n\nWhy did the talks fall apart?\n\nThe specifics might not be immediately clear, with both FCA and Renault thanking various parties after the fact.\n\nFCA pointed to “political conditions” in France. The French government has an ownership stake in Renault and obviously wanted to maintain a significant say in the new entity.\n\nFrench and Italian politicians and labor unions also wanted job guarantees and might not have been satisfied by FCA’s assurance that the deal would not require plant closures.\n\nThere was also Nissan, Renault’s partner, which was clearly concerned about how the deal would affect it. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa had said a full merger \"would require a fundamental review\" of the Nissan-Renault relationship.\n\nWith Jeep and Ram, why tie up with Renault?\n\nJeep is one of the strongest automotive brands in the world, and the Ram trucks brand is on a sales tear in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the auto industry is under pressure to develop electric and autonomous technology. That technology is expensive, and it’s not clear how long it will take for automakers or other players — tech and ride-hailing companies — to make either into a sustainable business.\n\nFCA has partnerships with Waymo and BMW/Intel/Mobileye related to autonomous vehicle development, but despite its well-regarded Pacifica Hybrid minivan and plans for a plug-in Wrangler, the company’s EV efforts lag others. The late Sergio Marchionne, FCA’s former CEO, used to say he lost money on every Fiat 500e that was sold.\n\nRenault, through its partnership with Nissan, is much further ahead on electric vehicles, which will be key in Europe and in China (although neither company is a sales leader there).\n\nMore:FCA withdraws merger offer as Renault board postpones decision\n\nMore:FCA chair explains decision to cut off talks with Renault\n\nMore:Fiat Chrysler merger speculation heats up — but what's new?\n\nConstant FCA merger talk\n\nIf you follow auto industry news, FCA’s name regularly comes up in speculation as a merger or acquisition candidate. Marchionne set the tone in 2015 with his “Confessions of a Capital Junkie,” a presentation on the benefits of industry consolidation.\n\nMarchionne was famously rebuffed in his efforts to get GM interested in FCA, but while he ran the company, other names also popped up as possibilities – Volkswagen, Hyundai, a parade of Chinese automakers.\n\nEarlier this year, PSA Group, which owns Peugeot and Opel, was in discussions with FCA. As for who might still be available, Krebs suggested a South Korean automaker. That could mean Hyundai is back in play.\n\nCan FCA survive on its own?\n\nWhile it’s often said that FCA needs a partner, numerous analysts believe the company does have a standalone future.\n\nRebecca Lindland, an industry expert who writes at rebeccadrives.com, said FCA can stand on its own because of Jeep, which is worth more than all its other brands combined. She said needed investments \"in autonomous vehicles, EVs and mobility as a service will be gathered through partnerships and alliances, just not a full merger. (However) economies of scale, shared insights, and expansion into new territories all are more difficult now without a full merger with Renault.”\n\nCharlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, noted that “Chrysler, in all its forms, has been dying for 40 years — history suggests they always figure something out.

The crust and top of the mantle make up another area called the \"lithosphere,\" which acts like a skin surrounding the Earth's surface, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe lithosphere, however, is not in one piece and exists like a puzzle or series of fragments, according to the United States Geological Survey. These parts of the lithosphere are not stationary and move slowly. These are called \"tectonic plates.\"\n\nAs the tectonic plates move and shift past one another, they occasionally bump or collide. This places stress on the plates' edges. When the stress becomes too great, it creates cracks called \"faults.\" The point where these faults move against each other is called the \"fault line.\"\n\nWhen there is too much friction between the fault lines, energy is suddenly released, triggering seismic waves that lead to an earthquake.\n\nWhen is the next earthquake in California?\n\nIt is not currently possible to predict an earthquake, though USGS scientists can calculate “the probability that a significant earthquake will occur in a specific area within a certain number of years,” according to USGS.\n\nWhile earthquake forecasts and probabilities can be determined, USGS says those reports are “comparable to climate probabilities and weather forecasts” and not the same as predictions.\n\nA USGS map of America reveals that portions of California face a greater than 95% chance of experiencing a slight or greater damaging earthquake shaking in 100 years. In other words, a strong earthquake on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale that will be “felt by all” will move some heavy furniture and cause slight damage.\n\nWhen was the last big earthquake in California?\n\nThe most recent significant earthquake in the state — either a magnitude of 6.5 or greater or that caused loss of life or more than $200,000 damage — was the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean near Ferndale in 2022, according to the state department of conservation, which tracks “big” earthquakes in California.\n\nThat earthquake struck in the early morning hours multiple miles west of Ferndale on Dec. 20, 2022, USA TODAY reported.

Tokyo high-rises swayed for several minutes, one city reported a small tsunami and at least two people were reportedly injured.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the earthquake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3 and struck in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Miyagi prefecture at 5:18 p.m. local time The epicenter was 6.2 miles beneath the seabed and 150 miles offshore.\n\nAfter the quake, authorities issued a warning that a tsunami potentially as high as 2.2 yards could hit.

Afterward, the announcer repeatedly urged all near the coast to flee to higher ground.\n\nMore than an hour after the quake struck, an unnamed official from the Meteorological Agency, speaking on national television, continued to warn people to stay away from the coast.\n\n\"Please take all precautions.

But residents in Maine got a taste of the real thing.\n\nBob Marvinney, Maine's state geologist, said he was sitting on his couch at home at 7:12 p.m. Tuesday, when the magnitude-4.0 quake hit. The shaking started 4 miles beneath the Earth, near Hollis Center in southwestern Maine, and resulted in no reports of damage or injuries, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).\n\n\"I felt a rumbling start, it started pretty gradual, and then it got to the strongest point\" and lasted about a half-minute, Marvinney said. \"I knew right away it had to be an earthquake.\"\n\nThough earthquakes on the East Coast have destroyed buildings and caused fatalities, they are usually smaller and far less frequent and therefore harder to predict than West Coast quakes, experts say. They behave differently because the Earth and rocks in the East are older, colder and denser than in the West, causing the shock waves from Eastern earthquakes to be felt much further away.\n\nTuesday's rumble came as emergency planners, school officials and building managers prepared for the Great Shakeout, which for the first time will include Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Across the country and around the world, more than 13 million people have registered at Shakeout.org to participate, according to USGS.\n\n\n\nThe drill happens on the third Thursday of October, and to illustrate that earthquakes are random, the time is always the same as the date, this year: 10:18 on 10/18. Southeastern states wanted to join the drill last year, but there wasn't time for publicity less than two months after a quake Aug. 23, says Brian Blake, earthquake program coordinator with the Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium, which organizes the drill.\n\nEarth scientists say the preparations are necessary because, despite their rarity, major earthquakes do happen on the East Coast, and they can be dangerous because people and structures are not prepared.\n\nMaine is near one of the more active earthquake zones on the East Coast, according to the USGS. The state shook from 16 quakes of magnitude 3.5 or greater during a 30-year period from 1974 to 2003, ranking 20th among all states for the highest number of earthquakes.\n\nTuesday's shaking was a \"thrust earthquake,\" the result of an up-and-down rupture below the Earth, said Rob Williams, who coordinates the Central and Eastern U.S. Earthquake Program for the USGS. One side of the fault moved a foot or two relative to the other 4 miles down, which is rather typical for the area, he says.\n\nTwo previous significant earthquakes have shaken the area: in 1904, when a magnitude-5.1 quake hit in the area of Calais and Eastport, and in 2006, when a magnitude-3.8 one hit central Maine.\n\nWhen a magnitude-5.8 earthquake shook the USGS headquarters in Virginia last year, facility managers at the government's science branch weren't sure what to do.\n\nLike most of their counterparts in school districts, sheriff's offices and businesses across the Southeast, \"earthquake wasn't an entry in their notebook\" of emergency plans, says geophysicist Mike Blanpied, associate coordinator of the USGS Hazards Program.\n\nAs a result, many people across the Southeast did the wrong thing, Blanpied says. Some stayed in place. Others ran outside as the ground continued to roll. Downtown Washington shut down after the quake, resulting in massive traffic jams that lasted hours.\n\n\"That one last year was just a little taste of what's coming in the near future,\" says Martin Chapman, a geophysicist at Virginia Tech University. \"There's a significant probability that a young child will experience significant shaking from an earthquake if they stay in the eastern South during his or her lifetime.\"\n\nMost people's natural reaction — run outside — is one of the most dangerous, Chapman says. \"That exposes you to things, cornices and chimney tops, falling down,\" he says. \"People get killed trying to run out of buildings.\"\n\nWhen the earth starts shaking, people should immediately \"drop, cover and hold on,\" meaning hit the floor, crawl under a desk or table and hold on to something until the shaking stops, according to the USGS and other national emergency response organizations. (The only exception: people in adobe buildings should take cover in a doorway or run outside.)\n\nThe geological record shows that severe earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater happen on average every 500 to 1,000 years on the East Coast. The strongest East Coast earthquake on record was one of magnitude 7.3 on Aug. 31, 1886, that killed 60 people and caused heavy damage in Charleston, S.C., and nearly destroyed the nearby town of Summerville. It was felt as far away as Chicago.\n\nIf such an earthquake hit a much more densely populated Charleston today, it would cause a lot more damage and injury, said Derrec Becker, spokesman for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division.\n\nDamage still exists from the quake in 1886, so there would be liquefaction of the ground and, according to emergency planners' estimates, 900 fatalities, 45,000 injuries and hundreds of schools, firehouses and bridges destroyed. The damage toll would reach $250 billion for the East Coast, according to a 2005 study by the South Carolina Emergency Management Division.\n\n\"It would be the largest natural disaster South Carolina had ever experienced,\" Becker said. \"We know significant earthquakes have occurred in the past, and it's not a matter of if but when.\"\n\nWest Coast quakes occur on the boundaries of tectonic plates, where the North American plate is moving south relative to the Pacific plate, which is diving under the North American plate. East Coast quakes release pressure through ancient fault lines in the middle of the North American plate for sometimes mysterious reasons, Williams said.East Coast earthquakes are caused for reasons that are totally different than on the West Coast, and in much older rocks, which makes it harder to predict where they are likely to happen, Williams says.\n\nSome of those pressures may be the release of loads created during the last ice age, 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, as the Earth bounces back from under the now-missing weight of ice thousands of feet thick. Those stresses are released through the Earth's crust, which is scarred by the remnants of billions of years of tectonic plate action. Geologists have mapped such faults all across the Eastern USA, Williams said.\n\n\"Most of the time, these faults are ancient features of the Earth's crust from the time when the Eastern U.S. was near a plate boundary, in Pangea, the last time all the plates were together, about 200 million years ago,\" Williams said. \" We see a lot of faults, but it's hard to determine which ones are active and which ones will become active.\"\n\nBecker says predicting when an earthquake will occur is not possible, but preparation can save lives.\n\nIn Charleston on the day of the drill, College of Charleston earthquake experts will lead lectures and walking tours of damage from the earthquake in 1886.\n\nThursday, 20 to 30 students from Holly Hill Elementary School in Orangeburg County will practice \"drop, cover and hold on\" at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia. The drill will be live-streamed on the Emergency Management Division's website, Becker said.\n\nIn Louisa County, Va., 4,700 students will practice the drill, as they have regularly since last year's quake destroyed two schools and displaced 40% of the student body. The handful of injuries there were all caused by falling objects, such as televisions, says Douglas Straley, assistant superintendent of Louisa County Public Schools.\n\n\"Last summer, it caught us all by surprise,\" Straley said.\n\nSome teachers didn't realize until the shaking was almost over that an earthquake was in process, and most didn't know what to do. Then they had to guide students outside — and in some cases carry them — across partially collapsed buildings and ceilings that covered the floors, he said. Thousands of students finished the school year sharing a middle school and in modular buildings.\n\n\"The uneasiness continues because we continue to still get aftershocks,\" Straley said. \"We had one a couple weeks ago. It's that reminder, not like a tornado that comes and is gone. Its continuous aftershocks is a continuous reminder that it can happen again.\"\n\nCloser to Washington, USGS Director Marcia McNutt will join students at Langston Hughes Middle School in Reston as they practice the drill.\n\nMontgomery College in Rockville, Md., will use the date as a multiphase emergency exercise, said Steve Maloney,director of emergency planning.\n\nMaloney's department has been sending e-mail and text messages about earthquake preparedness and how to prepare for emergencies at home for weeks leading up to today's drill.\n\n\"If they're not prepared at home, they won't come to school or work, so we want them to be prepared,\" he said.\n\nOn the day of the drill, security staff will assess all the buildings and practice evacuating one where earthquake \"damage\" has occurred, he said.\n\nDespite taking the drill seriously, Maloney said he views the chances of an earthquake as pretty low, but the drill is a good excuse to get people to think about emergencies.\n\n\"I think it's unlikely we'll have another big one,\" he said. \"For us, consequences for earthquakes are not that high. We worry a lot more about weather events.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/10/disease-flood-war-climate-refugee-crises-happening-now/39669605/", "title": "Disease, flood, war: Climate change refugee crises happening now", "text": "Michael B. Sauter and Evan Comen\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe total number of displaced people in the world has now surpassed an astounding 70 million people. This total includes nearly 26 million refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to fear of persecution, war, famine, flood, disease, and often a combination of these factors. There is mounting evidence that the conditions leading so many to flee their homes can be tied to one major cause: climate change.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, is one of the leading bodies identifying and assisting the world’s climate refugees. The group advocates for international policy changes and provides material assistance and legal advice for those displaced by crisis. Considering the emergencies for which the UNHCR provides assistance, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed five ongoing global refugee crises today related to climate change.\n\nWhen considering the groups that can be most affected by climate change, many would likely first think of rising sea levels affecting the populations of small, low-lying island nations. For example: Kiribati, the Pacific Island nation of roughly 100,000 residents, is projected to be effectively uninhabitable within decades. Even in the United States, there are a number of coastal cities that will soon be under water.\n\nClimate change:Europe's heat wave, globe sizzled to hottest June on record\n\nHealth implications:Climate change is a 'health emergency', 74 medical groups say\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nBut islands and low-lying inhabited areas are far from the only places on Earth where climate change is contributing to a refugee crisis. In fact, many of the worst active refugee crises in the world today are tied to worsening climate conditions. These emergencies are not expected to occur in the next few decades – they are already happening.\n\nOn every continent, water scarcity, drought, flooding, wildfires, and more – all conditions which have been shown to be increasing in intensity and frequency as a result of climate change – are displacing residents directly and exacerbating poor conditions for those who are fleeing their homes.\n\nWhile violent conflict, the source of a great many of the world’s refugee crises, is not directly a condition of climate change, it is clear that worsening climate conditions are often a root cause of these conflicts.\n\nIf you want to get involved helping these refugees and those who have been displaced by climate change, there are many ways you can help, including volunteering with and contributing financially to a nonprofit that specifically works on behalf of climate refugees. Here is a list of organizations that work directly to help climate refugees, including the UNHCR and the Environmental Justice Foundation.\n\n'A moral imperative':AOC, Bernie Sanders call for climate emergency declaration\n\n'The Ice at the End of the World':Scary clues of climate change in Greenland\n\n1. Myanmar\n\nMembers of the long-persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority group have often been displaced in Myanmar, but conditions caused by climate change exacerbated their circumstances and the country's current refugee crisis. After large parts of Myanmar were devastated by flooding and landslides in 2015, hundreds of thousands fled inundated areas, including Rohingya people. In the following years, the Southeast Asian nation has undergone a political change and faced a number of health crises.\n\nA surge of violence against the Rohingya in the summer of 2017 caused more than 700,000 to flee the country, the majority of which have gone to Bangladesh. In early July, massive flooding destroyed many of the temporary shelters of Rohingya refugees in the Cox’s Bazar settlement in Bangladesh, where over 900,000 refugees currently reside. According to the UNHCR, the vast majority of the Rohingya are women and children, and over 40% are under the age of 12.\n\nGet caught up:What is the Rohingya crisis?\n\nSea levels:Could rise 3 feet worldwide by 2300 — and it's likely to get worse\n\n2. Syria\n\nCivil war, not climate change, is commonly associated with the world’s worst refugee crisis. But a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that severe regional drought between 2006 and 2011 led to food shortages and illness in Syria and drove hundreds of thousands of residents to live in poor conditions on the outskirts of the country’s cities. It was these conditions that served as one of the primary triggers for the civil war that killed several hundred thousand and led to the refugee crisis. Further, the researchers concluded that climate change was a significant factor in the length and severity of the drought – the worst the country has faced in centuries – since normal variability in regional weather would not be sufficient to explain it.\n\nThere are roughly 5.6 million Syrians refugees living in neighboring countries. The majority of Syria’s refugees are in neighboring Turkey. In countries like Lebanon and Jordan, which are host to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, the vast majority of Syrian refugees do not live in organized camps and face severe poverty. Overall, there are nearly 13 million forcibly displaced Syrians, the largest such population in the world.\n\nSyria's civil war:Why did it start? What's the impact?\n\nChemical attack:White House warns Syria’s Bashar Assad\n\n3. South Sudan\n\nSouth Sudan is the third largest source of refugees in the world, after Syria and Afghanistan, according to the UNHCR. More than 2 million have fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia, as civil war continues to ravage the nation. Close to 2 million more have been displaced to other places within the country’s borders since the conflict began in 2013.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, flooding, food shortages, and disease have worsened conditions for South Sudanese refugees, many of who remain homeless. The majority of the country's refugees are women and children. A report published by the United Nations Environment Program in 2018 found that worsening drought and flooding conditions have directly led to competition for resources and worsened the ongoing conflict. Gary Lewis, Director of UN Environment’s Policy and Program Division, said “The country’s fragile natural environment has suffered enormously; fighting over natural resources together with the impacts of climate change are factors in driving this vicious cycle.”\n\nFood shortage:1.25 million face starvation in war-torn South Sudan\n\n4. Nigeria\n\nOver the past 10 years, attempts by jihadist group Boko Haram to rebel against the Nigerian government and establish an Islamic state in the region have led to thousands of deaths and the displacement of over 2.7 million people in the Lake Chad Basin. The crisis is exacerbated by climate change, as rising temperatures and reduced rainfall have rendered more land infertile and intensified the fight over Nigeria’s dwindling farmland.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, Nigeria loses an average of 867,337 acres of land, or 0.4% of the country's landmass, to drought and desertification every year. The drying of land and threat of Boko Haram in the northeast have pushed Nigeria’s mostly-Muslim, Fulani cattle herders further south, sparking deadly ethnic conflicts with Christian farmers in the southern half of the country and reducing the available supply of food throughout the region. According to the UNHCR, some 3.5 million people in the Lake Chad Basin region are food insecure.\n\nDeadly ethnic conflict:Scores killed in central Nigeria as farmers, herders clash\n\nNigerian military:Deletes tweet that justifies killing protesters with Trump's words\n\n5. Venezuela\n\nVenezuela is currently in the midst of a political upheaval, economic collapse, and severe drought that has led to a national humanitarian crisis and the outbound migration of more than 4 million refugees. The struggle for power by two rival politicians as well as hyperinflation – prices in Venezuela were doubling every 19 days on average by the end of 2018 – have contributed to instability in the country and caused mass shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, and power. In a 2017 survey, 60% of Venezuelans said they had gone to bed hungry because they could not afford food, and 64% said they had lost weight – 25 pounds in a year on average.\n\nThe situation is made worse by climate change. Venezuela received 50%-65% less rainfall than normal from 2013 to 2016, leading to widespread water shortages. In a country heavily reliant on hydropower – 64% of Venezuela’s electricity is from hydroelectric sources, compared to the 16% global average – the drought has not only led to food shortages but also to power shortages and frequent blackouts.\n\nEarthquake:Venezuela struck by magnitude 7.3 earthquake\n\nFleeing Venezuela:Migrants flood Colombia amid region’s worst humanitarian crisis\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Jacob \"Jake\" Hug of Phoenix figured out a way to call his mother from the other side of the world.\n\nThe Marine was somewhere in Nepal, helping the U.S. humanitarian effort after the first of two earthquakes that have killed more than 8,000 people and destroyed 600,000 homes.\n\nLate Tuesday, shortly after a second earthquake struck the country, the UH-1Y Huey helicopter Hug was aboard disappeared. Its wreckage, in pieces, and three bodies were found Friday in the mountains about 50 miles northeast of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.\n\nThe Marine's family and friends now await word on Hug, the five other Marines and two Nepalese army soldiers aboard the aircraft. The outlook is grim, officials said.\n\nThe 22-year-old based in Okinawa, Japan, was on temporary assignment in Nepal for about a week before the helicopter disappeared.\n\nHug and the others were taking tarps, rice and other supplies to remote locations in Charikot, the area worst hit in Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude quake that has killed 117 people so far and injured more than 2,800. The U.S. relief mission was deployed soon after a magnitude-7.8 quake hit April 25, killing more than 8,200 people.\n\nHug, a combat videographer, also was taking footage of relief efforts for the Defense Department.\n\n\"Between the first stop and the second stop, the helicopter reported an issue with the fuel line, and then being in such a remote location, it just disappeared,\" said his father, Jim Hug. \"There's no signs of a crash, no signs of smoke, no signs of a fire. The emergency beacon didn't go on.\"\n\nJim Hug said he is encouraged that his son and Jacob's fellow Marines are well trained for survival.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with a first-aid kit, fire extinguisher and a radio, Army Maj. David Eastburn, U.S. Pacific Command spokesman, told ABC News. Marine air crews typically are equipped with other survival items, including cold-weather clothing, fire starters, compasses, flexible saws and tourniquets, he said.\n\n\"We have hope that they're out there surviving,\" Jim Hug said.\n\nJake Hug spent May 6, his 22nd birthday, in Nepal contributing to the relief effort, a few days before he called his mother, Andrea Hug, on Mother's Day.\n\n\"I don't know how he even found access because he had been sleeping underneath a tarp on the ground for a week,\" his father said. \"He said he was tired and he was ready to go back, and just all the nice things that a great son would say to his mother on Mother's Day.\"\n\nJake Hug left for basic training just months after graduating from high school, said his uncle, Tim Hug. The young man felt a sense of duty to his country and was happy in the Marines.\n\n\"Jacob is a great kid. All he wanted to do was go into the military,\" his uncle said.\n\nBefore joining the Marines, Jake Hug worked part time in the produce section of a Safeway grocery. Jim Hug serves as a district manager for the chain. He kept boxes of books and read them two or three times each.\n\n\"He's a bookworm. You don't see Jacob without a book in his hand,\" his uncle said, adding that the young man read everything from Harry Potter to the classics.\n\nJacob comes from a large family, including sister Courtney, 22; brothers Zach, 20, and Nathan 17; and twin brother and sister Carter and Sydney, 7.

Rite Aid even said in a Sunday statement that it has raised $3.45 billion in financing from lenders as it continues to operate its stores while in bankruptcy.\n\nWhen the company last filed a financial report in June, it had $3.3 billion in debt, compared to the $135.5 million in cash it had on hand.\n\nIn the statement about Chapter 11 filing, Rite Aid laid out a restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming stores.\n\nUAW Strikes:How does autoworker union pay compare to other hourly jobs?\n\nWhat do we know about store closures?\n\nFounded in 1962, Philadelphia-based Rite Aid is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation with more than 2,000 stores in 17 states.\n\nMost customers won’t have to worry about the bankruptcy filing disrupting their ability to shop or fill prescriptions at their local stores — unless, of course, that store is now slated to close. Rite Aid, which has closed several stores in recent months, said in its media release that it's preparing to close more.\n\n\"Rite Aid regularly evaluates its store portfolio to ensure it is operating efficiently while meeting the needs of its customers, communities and associates,\" the company said in a statement. \"These efforts will further reduce the company’s rent expense and are expected to strengthen its overall financial performance.\"\n\nJoy Errico, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, declined to release further information about how many stores were slated to close or what the timeline for closures would be when reached Monday morning by USA TODAY.\n\nRite Aid said in the statement that it will communicate with customers of stores that will be closing and ensure they are able to get access to the services they need at other nearby locations. Employees at closing stores will also be transferred \"where possible,\" Rite Aid said.\n\nWhat other plans does Rite Aid have?\n\nRite Aid plans to use the bankruptcy to resolve its legal disputes and also sell some of its businesses, including prescription benefit manager Elixir Solutions that it bought in 2015 for $2 billion.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, Rite Aid appointed on Sunday a new CEO to lead restructuring, Jeff Stein, who will also serve as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board, Rite Aid said.\n\nStein, the founder of financial advisory firm Stein Advisors, said in a statement the company plans to remain in business for the long term.\n\n“My priorities will include overseeing the actions now underway to strengthen the company’s financial position and further advance its journey to reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy,” Stein said in the statement. “I have tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”\n\nInflation:How inflation is reshaping what employees need from their benefits\n\nWhy is Rite Aid facing opioid lawsuits?\n\nRite Aid's legal troubles related to its alleged role in the nationwide deadly abuse of opioids only further contributed to its mounting debt.\n\nThe many lawsuits filed against Rite Aid accuse the company of knowingly filling prescriptions for the addictive painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid asserting that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for excessive quantities of prescription pain killers that had “obvious red flags.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rise in U.S. opioid overdose deaths can be tied to the uptick in opioid prescriptions starting in the 1990s. Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Polster presided over separate proceedings in May to determine how much money should be awarded.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was initially filed in 2018, was part of the federal multi-district litigation created that year to address the manifold claims against opioid manufacturers and distributors.\n\nThe counties alleged that the pharmacies “abused their position of special trust and responsibility” as registered dispensers of controlled drugs, and in so doing “fostered a black market for prescription opioids,” the complaint reads.\n\nPolster wrote in his ruling that the awarded damages are meant to “address a small piece of a terrible and tenacious and escalating national tragedy.”\n\n“Even if the Court could wave a magic wand and forever remove any existing or future oversupply of legal prescription opioids, and prevent all future diversion of legal prescription opioids into the illicit market, this conjuring would do nothing to reduce the nuisance that would continue to exist in Lake and Trumbull Counties – that is, the widespread prevalence of OUD [opioid use disorder] and opioid addiction,” Polster wrote.\n\nSpokespersons for Walmart (WMT), CVS (CVS), and Walgreens all said they plan to appeal the ruling.\n\n“The facts and the law did not support the jury verdict last fall, and they do not support the court’s decision now,” Fraser Engerman, senior director of external relations for Walgreens, said in a statement. “As we have said throughout this process, we never manufactured or marketed opioids nor did we distribute them to the ‘pill mills’ and internet pharmacies that fueled this crisis.”\n\nWalmart released a statement saying the plaintiffs in the case “sued Walmart in search of deep pockets” and claimed the trial “was engineered to favor the plaintiffs’ attorneys and was riddled with remarkable legal and factual mistakes.”\n\n“Instead of addressing the real causes of the opioid crisis, like pill mill doctors, illegal drugs and regulators asleep at the switch, plaintiffs’ lawyers wrongly claimed that pharmacists must second-guess doctors in a way the law never intended and many federal and state health regulators say interferes with the doctor-patient relationship,” the statement reads.\n\nA representative for CVS said Polster’s ruling is a “misapplication” of the law.\n\n“We strongly disagree with the Court’s decision regarding the counties’ abatement plan, as well as last fall’s underlying verdict. Pharmacists fill legal prescriptions written by DEA-licensed doctors who prescribe legal, FDA-approved substances to treat actual patients in need,” Mike DeAngelis, executive director of corporate communications for CVS Health, said.\n\nLocal leaders in Trumbull and Lake Counties, however, lauded the ruling and said the damages will go toward opioid abatement measures.\n\nMauro Cantalamessa, Trumbull County commissioner, told CNN that the county hopes Wednesday’s ruling “will signal the beginning of the long road to recovery for the people of Trumbull County.”\n\n“For years, the dedicated frontline workers of Trumbull County have fought to address the harms of the opioid crisis. Through their experience and our efforts in this litigation, we know which mitigation strategies are effective in preventing further damage to our community. The news today means that we will soon have the long-awaited resources necessary to extend aid to properly address the harms caused by this devastating epidemic,” Cantalamessa said.\n\nLake County Commissioner John Plecnik said his county is investing the $306.2 million awarded to them into tackling the impacts of the opioid crisis in their communities.\n\n“I am grateful to the Court for recognizing the Opioid Epidemic as a public health crisis. This decision holds Big Pharma accountable for the great harm and lives lost due to the overselling of Opioids,” Plecnik said “We hope the legal precedent that Lake and Trumbull Counties have won together will set the stage for the rest of the nation and help end the Opioid epidemic.”\n\n– CNN’s Toby Lyles and Evan Simko-Bednarski contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura Ly"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/10/26/pharmacy-chains-dangerous-conditions-medication-errors/71153960007/", "title": "Pharmacy chains ignored pleas to fix broken system. Now it's in revolt", "text": "Pharmacists with the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain felt dangerously burned out.\n\nIt was August 2020. The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Disruptions in the workforce needed to serve and deliver meals – along with supplies of food and packaging materials – are behind the shortages, Al.com reports. State education officials say every school district in Alabama is facing shortages to some degree. Alexander City Schools recently warned parents that it’s experiencing supply chain issues with its food vendors. In recent weeks, the school system hasn’t received food deliveries because suppliers are short on supplies, drivers and warehouse employees. The school system asked parents to feed breakfast to their students at home if possible. In southeast Alabama, Dothan City Schools asked parents last month to prepare for a possible shift to remote learning due to the district’s food supply issues.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Several Republican state lawmakers are urging easier access to ivermectin amid the pandemic, though that drug is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for preventing or treating COVID-19. Senate Majority Leader Shelley Hughes of Palmer said she urged Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state health commissioner to consider supplying Alaskans with vitamins and drugs, including ivermectin, “that some Alaskan physicians are prescribing but pharmacies aren’t filling.” Three Republican House members testified about ivermectin at a recent state pharmacy board meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. “Maybe the pharmacists could be directed – or directed’s the wrong word – suggested that they allow the doctors to actually be doctors and do their jobs,” said Rep. Kevin McCabe of Big Lake. In a letter to the House members after the meeting, the board’s chair, Justin Ruffridge, a Kenai Peninsula pharmacist, noted potential legal liability for pharmacists for drugs they dispense and said pharmacists were free to use their “professional judgment” when deciding whether to fill prescriptions. He said the board has not threatened pharmacists’ licenses around the issue but said reports of misuse of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 “should give most prescribers and pharmacists reason to pause.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has blocked the state from collecting $1.1 million from the city of Flagstaff to compensate for its minimum wage that is higher than the state’s rate, ruling that the state missed a deadline for the assessment and was stretching a law targeting higher voter-approved city wages to collect its indirect costs. But the ruling from Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith released Monday sidestepped the question of whether the assessments are unconstitutional. The state minimum wage reached $12 an hour in 2020 with inflation adjustments after that and now stands at $12.15 an hour. Flagstaff voters in 2016 phased in higher city minimum wages, which hit $15 per hour this year with annual increases thereafter. Smith’s ruling said a law enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2019 targeting higher local minimum wages set a July 31 deadline for setting the yearly assessment. The state missed that deadline. The judge also said the state can’t charge for the indirect costs of Flagstaff’s higher minimum wage, which is what it did in coming up with the $1.1 million figure. The state is exempt from paying the higher minimum wage Flagstaff voters approved in 2016, and the law authorizing assessments does not specifically say the state can calculate the indirect costs of paying contractors.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers sent the governor a congressional redistricting plan that critics say weakens the influence of minority voters in the Little Rock area by splitting the state’s most populous county among three U.S. House districts. The measure splits portions of Pulaski County, a heavily Democratic county that includes Little Rock, among the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts. The county is currently in the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent years. Republicans hold all four of the state’s U.S. House seats and a majority of both chambers of the Legislature. Democrats have criticized the plan for moving predominantly Black and Hispanic precincts out of the 2nd District and accused Republicans of trying make a GOP district even redder. Arkansas is the only former Confederate state that has not elected a Black representative to the U.S. House. “It’s going to disenfranchise African American communities, regardless of the intent,” state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, said before the House approved the measure last week. Supporters of the plan say splitting Pulaski County makes sense given its location in the middle of the state. They also say it helps limits the number of counties split up. Opponents of splitting up counties have said it divides up communities and their interests.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: Recordings indicate the pilot of a twin-engine plane nose-dived into a San Diego suburb despite a growingly concerned air traffic controller who repeatedly warned the pilot to climb in altitude – information that will be examined by investigators who arrived at the crash scene Tuesday. The Cessna 340 smashed into a UPS van, killing the driver, and then hit two houses to ignite just after 12 p.m. Monday in Santee, a suburb of 50,000 people east of San Diego. United Parcel Service of America Inc. held a moment of silence Tuesday for van driver Steve Krueger, who was remembered for making work better with his laugh, the company said in a statement. The plane’s owner, an Arizona physician, also died, and an elderly couple whose home went up in flames after it was hit suffered burns. It was unclear whether others were on board the plane. An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash scene Tuesday morning, according to agency spokeswoman Jennifer Gabris. Investigators will review radar data, weather information, air traffic control communication, airplane maintenance records and the pilot’s medical records, she said. The plane had planned to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport in San Diego when it crashed.\n\nColorado\n\nPine: Wildlife officials say an elusive elk that has been wandering the hills with a car tire around its neck for at least two years has finally been freed of the obstruction. The 41/ 2 -year-old, 600-pound bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, southwest of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquilized, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the encumbrance because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tire. “We would have preferred to cut the tire and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic, and we had to just get the tire off in any way possible,” Officer Scott Murdoch said. Murdoch and fellow officer Dawson Swanson estimated the elk shed about 35 pounds with the removal of the tire, the antlers and debris inside the tire. Wildlife officers first spotted the elk with the tire around its neck in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. They said they have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife become entangled in a number of items, including swingsets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSimsbury: A plot of land that was once a thriving tobacco farm where Martin Luther King Jr. worked as a college student in the 1940s will be protected for its historic and cultural significance to the state’s civil rights history. Last month’s finalized sale of the 288-acre parcel of land was announced Friday. The nonprofit Trust for Public Land and the town of Simsbury plan to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday for the Meadowood site. Nearly 130 acres will be set aside for recreational access and roughly 120 acres for working farmland. The rest will be saved for future needs of the town of Simsbury, while 2 acres will be kept for historic preservation purposes. Simsbury voters in May overwhelmingly authorized $2.5 million to purchase the property. Various state agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the George Dudley Seymour Trust, individuals and foundations have provided an additional $4 million. Historians believe King’s experiences in Connecticut influenced his decision to become a minister and civil rights leader. He was among a group of students from Atlanta’s Morehouse College recruited by tobacco growers to work in the fields to earn money for tuition. “On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see,” King wrote his father in June 1944. “After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit any where we want to.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor, who is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted Monday on public corruption charges. An indictment issued by a New Castle County grand jury charges Kathleen McGuiness, 58, with felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, plus misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with state procurement laws. Prosecutors said the charges include allegations that McGuiness hired her daughter and one of her daughter’s friends, both high school seniors at the time, as temporary employees in May 2020, even though other temporary employees had to leave their positions because of the lack of available work amid the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said Elizabeth McGuiness, who has not been charged, continued to be paid even after enrolling at a college in South Carolina last August, and she was still listed as an employee as recently as Aug. 28 of this year. She was initially listed as a “public information officer” and later as an “intern.” McGuiness also is charged with orchestrating a 2019 no-bid “communications services” contract for a company she had used as a campaign consultant when running for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University and Netflix have announced a $5.4 million endowed scholarship to honor the late actor, writer, producer and Howard alumnus Chadwick Boseman, WUSA-TV reports. The Chadwick A. Boseman Memorial Scholarship will provide incoming students in the College of Fine Arts, recently named for Boseman, with a four-year scholarship to cover the full cost of tuition, the university said. “This scholarship embodies Chadwick’s love for Howard, his passion for storytelling, and his willingness to support future generations of Howard students,” Howard University President Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick said in a release. “I am thankful for the continuous support and partnership of Chadwick’s wife, Mrs. Simone Ledward-Boseman, and to Netflix for this important gift.” The scholarship was established with the support of Ledward-Boseman, with Netflix as the inaugural donor. The first four scholarships were earmarked for one recipient in each class beginning this fall, and they’ll continue to be distributed to an incoming freshman every year. The university said the scholarship will focus on students who exemplify exceptional skills in the arts, reminiscent of Boseman, and who demonstrate financial need.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state is investigating dozens of local governments, performing arts centers, the Miami Marlins, a law enforcement counterterrorism unit and a concert by singer Harry Styles for violating a law prohibiting businesses and governments from requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. About 120 cases are being reviewed for violations of Florida’s “vaccine passport” law, which took effect last month and can result in a $5,000 fine per violation, according to a public records request from the Orlando Sentinel. The law is being challenged in court and conflicts with a Biden administration order that companies with over 100 employees require them to be vaccinated or face weekly coronavirus testing. In central Florida, the list includes Orange County government; the Orange County Convention Center; AdventHealth, one of the state’s largest health care systems; several performing arts venues; and the Amway Center, which is home to the Orlando Magic and recently hosted a concert by Styles whose tour mandated attendees either be vaccinated or have a negative test. “At this point … the courts have not reached the final decision, but the indication is that the Florida law flies in the face of our Florida Constitution and perhaps in the face of common sense,” Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings told the newspaper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials in Fulton County, where election operations are already under review by the state, have fired two workers accused of shredding paper voter registration applications, according to a county statement released Monday. Preliminary information indicates the employees checked out batches of applications for processing, and they are alleged to have shredded some of the forms, the Fulton County statement said. Fellow employees reported the alleged actions to their supervisor Friday morning, and the two employees were fired that day. The county statement said the applications were received in the past two weeks. Fulton County includes most of the city of Atlanta, where voters are set to go to the polls Nov. 2 to elect a mayor, City Council members and other municipal officials. The deadline to register to vote in that election was Oct. 4. It’s not immediately clear whether the 300 voter registration records in question were lost, county spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. “Normally, processing a voter registration application involves entering them in the state system, updating them, verifying their information,” she said. “That is the matter that’s under investigation – was that process completed.” Voters don’t register by party in Georgia, so the applications had no party affiliation.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: The median sales price of a single-family home in Maui County dropped below $1 million last month as people priced out of the market have chosen to pause their homebuying. The Maui News reports the median sales price for a single-family home in the county stood at $996,500 in September. That’s up 27.3% from the same month last year. But it’s below levels from May through August, when the median topped $1 million for four straight months. Median sales prices for single-family homes in Kauai and Honolulu counties have also topped $1 million this year. The September report from the Realtors Association of Maui said declining affordability has had “a significant impact” on homebuyers who have been priced out of the market. Association President Keone Ball said Sunday that he believes prices will go back up. “The problem is the volume – you know, there isn’t enough for sale,” he said, noting that low inventory combined with high demand for affordable housing is also a nationwide problem. Pending sales decreased 4.3% for single-family homes in Maui County but increased 5.7% for condominiums. Ball said investment in condos may have spiked due to the settling of the COVID-19 pandemic, affordability and condominiums being “the only option.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials will make available up to $200,000 to be divided into payments for hunters and trappers who kill wolves in the state through next summer. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game late last month entered into an agreement with a nonprofit hunting group to reimburse the expenses for a proven kill. The agreement follows a change in Idaho law aimed at killing more wolves that are blamed for attacking livestock and reducing deer and elk herds. Montana this year also expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the request of environmental groups concerned about the expanded wolf killing in the two states, last month announced a yearlong review to see if wolves in the U.S. West should be relisted under the Endangered Species Act. Idaho has managed wolves since they were taken off the list in 2011. State wildlife managers had been incrementally increasing wolf harvest during that time – but not fast enough for lawmakers, who earlier this year passed the law backed by some trappers and the powerful ranching sector. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves before federal authorities would take over management.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Al Capone died nearly 75 years ago, but it’s clear interest in the infamous Chicago gangster is very much alive after some of his prized possessions were auctioned off over the weekend for at least $3 million. The Chicago Tribune reports Capone’s family sold several of his belongings, including what was billed as his favorite gun, at auction in California, where his three surviving granddaughters live. The event, called “A Century of Notoriety: The Estate of Al Capone,” was held at a private club in Sacramento and attracted nearly 1,000 registered bidders, including 150 who attended the nearly four-hour-long event in person. Among the items up for auction was a bear-shaped humidor as well as diamond jewelry and some family photographs. The most popular item proved to be Capone’s favorite Colt .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, which went for $860,000. The story of Capone, the original “Scarface,” is a familiar one, thanks in large part to a host of movies, television shows and books about the mobster. Called Public Enemy No. 1 after the 1929 “Valentine’s Day Massacre” in which seven members of a rival bootlegger gang were gunned down in a Lincoln Park parking garage, Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1934. He spent 11 years locked up in Alcatraz and died of a heart attack in 1947.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 6,600 Afghan refugees who began arriving at the Indiana National Guard’s Camp Atterbury training post nearly six weeks ago are awaiting resettlement. Additional evacuees are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear how many, said Mark Howell, regional spokesman for the federal Transportation Security Administration overseeing Operation Allies Welcome. Officials said they’re also uncertain if the refugees will be permanently resettled by early November, as hoped. Howell said Friday that many Afghans are still completing medical and security screening checks. Once cleared, they’ll work with nongovernmental organizations to determine housing assignments, sponsor families and work authorizations before they can leave the post. Camp Atterbury, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, is one of eight sites in the U.S. that the Department of Defense is using for Afghan special immigrant visa applicants, their families and other Afghan personnel. Exodus Refugee Immigration, an Indianapolis agency, has helped at least four Afghan families resettle in the city in the past month, Executive Director Cole Varga said. They were all U.S. citizens or had visas and family ties to the area. It’s unclear how many Afghans have resettled in Indiana, but the state is projected to take 490, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has found a local activist guilty of a felony theft count for taking a police flyer used to identify protesters from an officer’s back pocket during a protest last year. Alexandria Dea, 27, was found guilty of first-degree theft Monday by Judge David Porter after she waived her right to a jury trial and consented to allow the judge to base his decision on facts already on the record. Dea is expected to seek a deferred judgment when she’s sentenced Dec. 7. Prosecutors have said Dea picked up and threw a police radio that fell to the ground as the officer scuffled with a protester July 1, 2020. She was also accused of taking the intelligence bulletin from an officer’s back pocket during the confrontation, then giving it to another Black Lives Matter activist who gave it to a television reporter. Dea and the other activist had also initially been charged with a rarely used count of leaking intelligence data, but the charge was dismissed in July after a judge ruled that the bulletin did not count as “intelligence data.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has facilitated donations totaling $1 million for an effort to investigate wrongful convictions in Wyandotte County. The money was raised by Team Roc, which is the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation, the Kansas City Star reports. Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, called it “a huge investment,” adding that the ability to look at these cases is going to shine a light on what the group needs to do to provide a just criminal legal system in Wyandotte County. Among those injustices is the wrongful conviction of Lamonte McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for two murders he did not commit in Kansas City, Kansas. Another is the case of Olin “Pete” Coones Jr., who spent 12 years in prison before he was exonerated of a Wyandotte County murder – only to die from cancer that went undiagnosed 108 days after he was freed. About 40 others have asked the innocence project to investigate their convictions in Wyandotte County, Rojo Bushnell said Monday. In September, Team Roc filed a petition seeking records from the Kansas City, Kansas, police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city has agreed to pay $75,000 to a couple who say police removed them from their car and frisked them because they were Black and driving a nice vehicle. But in an unusual condition of the payment, the couple and their lawyers are forbidden from criticizing the Louisville Metro Government or the police officers involved. The prohibition includes criticisms in statements to the media or on social media, according to a copy of the settlement obtained under open records laws. Michael Abate, a lawyer for the Louisville Courier Journal and the Kentucky Press Association, said the stipulations are “totally improper.” “The city is paying to silence its critics,” he said. “It is paying them off. And it seems designed to impede reform. It is bad policy and really troubling.” In a statement, First Assistant County Attorney Ingrid Geiser said the couple “are not prohibited from talking truthfully about what happened during their traffic stop,” though she said the language “should have more accurately reflected the agreement of the parties.” In their federal lawsuit, Anthony Parker Sr. and Demetria Firman, who are now married, say they were pulled over in 2018 for failing to use a turn signal, but body camera footage from one of the officers showed their turn signal was on.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s problem of wasted COVID-19 vaccine shots continues to balloon, with about 224,000 doses thrown out across Louisiana as health providers can’t find enough residents willing to roll up their sleeves. The number of trashed doses has nearly tripled since the end of July, even as the state grappled with a fourth, deadly surge of the coronavirus pandemic during that time that led to increased interest in the vaccines. The latest data provided by the Louisiana Department of Health showed 223,918 doses of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been thrown out. That’s relatively small compared to the 4.4 million vaccine doses administered around the state. But while waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, the throwing away of doses in the United States comes as millions of people around the globe still are waiting for the opportunity to get inoculated against COVID-19. Most of Louisiana’s wasted vaccine doses happened because vials containing the shots were opened, but hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other providers couldn’t find someone to take the doses, health department spokesperson Kevin Litten said. More than 21,500 shots simply weren’t used before their expiration dates. Louisiana has one of the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmental regulators will soon undertake a statewide investigation to find concentrations of long-lasting environmental pollutants. The investigation stems from the state’s efforts to mitigate a class of chemicals known as PFAS, also called “forever chemicals.” The substances are a problem in some parts of Maine because of the long-standing use of municipal sludge and paper mill waste as farm fertilizer, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state set aside $30 million to test for the chemicals and install filtration systems in areas with contaminated water. Maine officials also plan to help farmers and start cleaning up sites, the Press Herald reports. Maine is hiring and training 17 new staff members for the effort. The state needs to decide which of more than 500 sludge application sites should be prioritized for testing. Sewage sludge as farm fertilizer has caused environmental problems in other parts of the country as well. The chemicals also carry human health risks.\n\nMaryland\n\nGaithersburg: Four police officers will not be charged for fatally shooting a Black man they said fired first during a late-night foot chase in January. A grand jury declined to charge the officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department due to lack of evidence in a decision announced last week. The officers, members of a plainclothes street crimes unit, told investigators they saw a “muzzle flash” from a gun aimed at them by Kwamena Ocran, 24, according to their recorded statements released by Montgomery County prosecutors. One officer said he heard a round pass by his head. All four fired on Ocran, who was running away from them. He was hit eight times, according to a report from prosecutors. The shooting happened outside an apartment complex after officers said they received a tip that Ocran was illegally carrying a gun he intended to sell, according to the report. The incident was not recorded on video. Another officer arrived at the scene moments later and recorded footage of a gun next to Ocran’s body, but investigators could not find evidence he had fired it. Crime scene technicians failed to find shell casings from Ocran’s gun – only the 23 shell casings from the officers’ guns, prosecutors said. Howard County Deputy State’s Attorney Christopher Sandmann told The Washington Post that investigators had prepped Ocran’s hands for gunshot reside analysis, but there was a “mistake or miscommunication,” and his hands were never swabbed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by founding father Alexander Hamilton during the Revolutionary War and believed stolen decades ago from the state archives has been returned following a federal appeals court decision, officials said Tuesday. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin hailed the homecoming, after last week’s decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a previous ruling by a district court judge. The letter was reputedly stolen between 1938 and 1945 by a “kleptomaniacal cataloguer” who worked at the archives, according to the court decision. Hamilton wrote the letter to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army. Dated July 21, 1780, the letter resulted in Massachusetts sending troops to Rhode Island “to bolster the embattled French forces,” the appeals court wrote. Galvin, whose office oversees the archives and the Commonwealth Museum, said he was pleased the court ruled “that this historical treasure belongs to the people.” The letter is expected to be put on display at the museum for special events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, Galvin said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCenter Line: An employee at a suburban Detroit nursing home filled out absentee ballot applications for two dozen residents without consulting them before the 2020 election, authorities said Monday. The case was one of three cases of alleged fraud announced by the state. “Our election system is secure, and today’s charges demonstrate that in the rare circumstances when fraud occurs, we catch it and hold the perpetrators accountable,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. A woman who worked at the Father Murray home in Center Line was charged with election forgery and signature forgery. In another case, a Detroit woman was accused of signing her grandson’s name on an absentee ballot and returning it, even though he had decided to vote at a polling place. In a third investigation, a woman who served as a guardian was charged in several communities after authorities said she fraudulently submitted 26 absentee ballot applications and sought to have ballots mailed directly to her. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel praised local election officials for noticing irregularities. “We will not hesitate to prosecute anyone who attempts to undermine our elections,” Nessel said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBeaver Bay: A Lake Superior lighthouse plans to welcome visitors back for an annual memorial honoring the sailors who died when the Edmund Fitzgerald sank. Every Nov. 10, the day the ship sank in a gale in 1975, the Split Rock Lighthouse just south of Beaver Bay holds a beacon lighting. Lighthouse officials announce the names of all 29 sailors who died as a bell tolls, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The lighthouse didn’t allow visitors to attend last year’s ceremony because of COVID-19 concerns. People had to listen through an online livestream. Lighthouse officials say this year’s ceremony will be a hybrid, with the lighthouse grounds open to the public and a livestream on the Minnesota Historical Society’s Facebook and YouTube pages for those who can’t attend. The ceremony will begin at 4:30 p.m. “There’s something about being here on site and hearing the bell ring and the names being read off and then seeing the beacon turned on right after that. There’s just something very special about that,” said Hayes Scriven, the lighthouse site manager. “It’s just a way to connect with the past and remember that Lake Superior is a fickle animal, and you’ve got to respect the power and not take it for granted.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Book Festival is being shown online after the in-person event was canceled because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers say videos of 31 panel discussions have been recorded in the past month. Those became available Tuesday on the festival’s website, msbookfestival.com. “We’ve got an amazing group of authors and moderators who have rallied to record more than 35 hours of great conversations about books and writing,” Executive Director Ellen Daniels said in a news release. “Honoring these writers and continuing to engage our loyal and growing community of book lovers is what the festival is all about.” Among the authors speaking are Curtis Wilkie, Kiese Laymon, Nic Stone, W. Ralph Eubanks, Jerry Mitchell, Catherine Pierce, Beth Ann Fennelly, Mitch Landrieu, William Ferris, Angie Thomas, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Robert Khayat and Kai Bird. The festival originally was scheduled for Aug. 21 at the Mississippi Capitol and nearby Galloway United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson. Organizers switched to the online format because the state was experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases at the time.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Data shows that most of the people who participated in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine lottery were already immunized before the program started. The incentive program was started in July as Missouri struggled to control a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the more transmissible delta variant in less-vaccinated communities. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted the last of the drawings in the program Friday. Among the participants, 57,117 adults got the shot after the program was announced, while nearly 600,000 got the shot beforehand, The Kansas City Star reports. The program also had more than 39,000 entries from children 12 and up. In total, the state will pay out $9 million to 900 prizewinners, who will each receive $10,000 in either cash or, for the youth winners, scholarship accounts. Anyone who had gotten at least one dose of a vaccine was eligible to enter, but separate drawings were conducted for those who had already gotten a shot, making the odds of winning higher for the newly vaccinated. Just over 48% of Missouri’s total population is fully vaccinated now, up from about 40% when the incentive program was announced.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: All local calls in the state must be dialed with the 406 area code to connect beginning Oct. 24 due to changing federal regulations. Montana’s 406 area code currently allows seven-digit dialing to complete local calls. That will change this month due to a Federal Communications Commission order designating 988 as the new nationwide number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Some seven-digit phone numbers in Montana’s 406 area code begin with 988. To prevent misdialing the 988 Lifeline, all local calls in Montana must be dialed with the area code. Calls that are currently considered local for billing purposes will continue to be billed as local calls. Existing seven-digit phone numbers will not change but will require the 406 area code to connect. Three-digit dialing services, such as the 911 emergency number, will continue to work as a three-digit number with no need to dial an area code. Along with manually dialed calls, all services that use automated dialing will need to be updated to include 10-digit phone numbers. The 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will be available beginning July 16, 2022.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police are investigating after downtown pedestrians were forced to dodge deck chairs, tables and bricks thrown from a rooftop. The Omaha World-Herald reports the incident happened Saturday night when items were thrown from the roof of the nine-story Old Market Lofts apartments. Omaha resident Lisa Brauer told the newspaper she was nearly struck by several objects. Brauer, who works for Park Omaha, was checking parking meters when she was nearly hit by a rock. That was followed by a metal table, a metal chair and a grill rack, all landing within inches of her. A police report said a pickup truck was hit by something and sustained $2,000 in damage. No arrests have been made.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Two historic locomotives that were part of the pioneering shift from steam-powered to diesel-electric trains in the mid-1900s are coming back to their home in a northeast Nevada railyard. Built in 1951, Locomotive 201 is the last survivor among 38 experimental models manufactured by the American Locomotive Company. It is scheduled to be loaded onto a truck Nov. 2 at the Northwest Railway Museum in Snoqualmie, Washington, where it still sometimes pulls excursion trains on the museum’s Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. The truck hauling the 286,000-pound engine will take four or five days at a top speed of about 35 mph to make the 900-mile trip back to Ely at the Nevada Northern Railway Museum near the Nevada-Utah line, railway President Mark Bassett said. Details are still pending for the return from Delta, Utah, of the No. 401, the first special-duty model General Motors built in 1952 in its Electro-Motive Division. It was the only one painted in the “Desert War Bonnet” scheme, a cream, scarlet and black design that remains on it today. It became known as the “Last Empress of Ely.” “These both are one-of-a-kind locomotives,” Bassett said. “Both have a story to tell, and they are both tied into the early days of dieselization of the Nevada Northern Railway.” The museum plans to restore each and eventually return them to operation for tour rides.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: For the first time, New Hampshire’s only state-run psychiatric treatment facility has negotiated contracts with all major insurance carriers in the state. Carriers now under contract with New Hampshire Hospital include Aetna, Ambetter, Anthem, Cigna, Harvard Pilgrim and United Health Care, state officials said. “Over the past few years, we have made significant strides to rebuild New Hampshire’s mental health system, and those critical efforts will continue,” Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. “Having insurer contracts in place is an important step and will help alleviate the financial uncertainty that has been a challenge for patients at New Hampshire Hospital for decades.” Previously, special case agreements were negotiated on a patient-by-patient basis. However, some care was uncompensated. The practice of New Hampshire Hospital is to accept all patients regardless of insurance coverage. New Hampshire Hospital is currently the only inpatient institute for adults with serious mental illnesses in the state.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: No one understands the stress a nurse faces on the job better than another nurse. And nothing has caused more stress for nurses than the COVID pandemic, as front-line caregivers guard against exposure to the coronavirus, witness patient deaths, and worry about family members and friends becoming infected. A confidential mental health help line, staffed by current and retired nurses, was launched Monday for nurses and their family members in the state. The Nurse2Nurse help line – at 844-687-7301 – is based at Rutgers Behavioral Health Services and available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. “It’s in our hearts to help the healers,” said Barbara Brilliantine, one of the nurses staffing the help line. “We’ve walked in their shoes.” The counselors include active and retired nurses who receive training in reciprocal peer support and wellness principles and are mental health and peer support specialists. Services are also available through virtual support groups, wellness webinars and other resources at nurse2nursenj.com. Information provided on the calls is confidential, the sponsors say. The website says the project is not affiliated with any health care system or nursing organization, and no information from the calls will be shared with employers, co-workers or peers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The final price tag for a settlement reached by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a former campaign spokesman to settle accusations of harassment is now $150,000. The latest round of payments was disclosed in a mandatory campaign finance report that the Democrat’s campaign filed Monday. The twice-annual report on spending and contributions shows the incumbent has raised $2.5 million since April for her reelection bid as several Republicans are vying to take back the office. GOP state Rep. Rebecca Dow raised more than $440,500 since announcing her candidacy in early July. Her campaign said she has received contributions from more than 1,300 donors. In the settlement involving Lujan Grisham, former campaign staffer James Hallinan had accused Lujan Grisham of dropping water on his crotch and then grabbing his crotch in the midst of a campaign staff meeting prior to the election – accusations that the governor denies. Lujan Grisham said earlier this year that she decided to resolve the matter because she wanted to focus her attention on the pandemic. At the time, the governor said there hadn’t been any other financial settlements and nondisclosure agreements of a similar nature.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recreational marijuana legalization is moving into a new phase. After stifling staff delays brought on by political infighting, newly minted members of the state Cannabis Control Board are now interpreting and shaping the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the cannabis law approved by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers last spring. Much of what the redefined medical cannabis program and the implementation of the potentially lucrative legal market will look like in the Empire State is in the purview of the five-person panel, which had its first meeting last week. The board must do that work while putting particular emphasis on social equity and repairing the harms done during the substance’s prohibition. Already, language in the law has legalized possession of 3 ounces of cannabis for people 21 and over. However, some of the regulations for localities, as well as the licensing process and social equity provisions, have yet to materialize. Kristin Jordan of Park Jordan, a commercial real estate brokerage and cannabis industry advisory firm, said the cannabis regulators don’t have a model in other states in how to legalize while accentuating social equity. “So I think more than anything we’ve got a roadmap of what didn’t work,” said Jordan, the firm’s founder and CEO.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is facing calls to resign from elected officials and LGBTQ advocacy groups over comments he made criticizing sexual education and likening gay and transgender people to “filth.” “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth,” Robinson said at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove. The state’s highest Republican executive officeholder, already the focus of criticism for trying to influence how racism can be discussed in public schools, is getting more pushback since Right Wing Watch, a project of the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, posted the video on social media last week. The Human Rights Campaign, Equality North Carolina, prominent Democratic lawmakers and the White House have condemned the remarks, with some demanding the lieutenant governor’s resignation. In a video posted on his Facebook page Saturday, Robinson narrated over images depicting gay sex that were taken from “Gender Queer,” an illustrated book he claimed “is currently in North Carolina schools,” though it wasn’t mentioned in the 831-page report he released in August highlighting cases of alleged “indoctrination.” In 2017, Robinson wrote: “You CAN NOT love God and support the homosexual agenda.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials are urging people to keep an eye out for migrating whooping cranes. The North Dakota Fish and Game Department says a portion of a population of 500 cranes is crossing the state on a 2,500-mile migration from nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada to wintering grounds in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. The agency says anyone who spots cranes should leave them alone but record the date, time and location along with the birds’ activities and report the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The reports help biologists locate crane habitat areas, monitor marked birds, and determine population numbers and migration routes.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: Thanks to a long-forgotten state law from 1953 and a community dinner, the city has challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. census. The results of last year’s count had downgraded the Athens County community from a city to a village after counting 4,612 residents – a 780-person drop from the 2010 census. Under Ohio law, the 5,000-resident level demarcates the difference between a city and a village. “We knew it was wrong,” City Auditor Taylor Sappington said. On Tuesday morning, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose agreed, restoring Nelsonville’s city status. Sappington set out to prove the city’s case by collecting census information and signatures from the town’s 5,373 residents. After a preliminary federal census report demotes a city to a village, state law gives a city auditor the authority to conduct a re-enumeration if the municipality’s governing body passes a resolution directing the auditor to do so, according to a statute in the Ohio Revised Code. After the City Council took that action, Sappington appointed five enumerators, who canvassed each block of Nelsonville over 10 days. Last week, volunteers served ham, green beans, cheesy potatoes, salad and rolls donated by Texas Roadhouse at a free community dinner where residents could come down to the town square to be counted, Sappington told council members Monday night. “I’m so proud of this community,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city and Tulsa County have each announced they will officially recognize Juneteenth as a holiday. June 19 will be an additional paid holiday for city and county employees beginning in 2022. June 19, 1865, is the day Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas – some 21/ 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves in Southern states. “Juneteenth is an important day in our country’s history, and I’m glad we are able to celebrate freedom for all Americans in this way by joining Tulsa County in adding Juneteenth to our official holiday schedule,” Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement Monday announcing the holiday. A 1921 massacre in Tulsa left an estimated 300 Black people dead at the hands of white mobs. Then-President Donald Trump scheduled his first campaign rally amid the coronavirus pandemic for June 19, 2020, in Tulsa but later rescheduled the rally for the following day amid widespread criticism from Black leaders. In June, President Joe Biden signed legislation officially recognizing the day as a federal holiday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Former Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno and three other Republicans have filed a lawsuit to challenge new congressional districts recently passed by state lawmakers. They say the new maps are partisan gerrymandering, unconstitutional and contrary to state law. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the suit, filed Monday in Marion County Circuit Court, is the first such attempt to alter the six-district map that Democrats pushed through during a contentious special legislative session last month. That session nearly ended in a Republican walkout after House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, reneged on a deal to grant the GOP an equal say in new congressional and legislative maps. Instead, Republican lawmakers showed up on the last possible day and allowed Democrats to pass a map that could lead to Democratic control of five of the state’s now-six seats in Congress. Oregon picked up an additional U.S. House seat because of population gains recorded by the recent U.S. census. The suit notes that four of the state’s six new congressional districts include part of the Portland metro area, which the Republicans say is a sign Democrats improperly stocked the districts with left-leaning voters. They have asked the court to block the plan and draw its own.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Total enrollment at Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities has declined to the lowest level in decades, according to data released Monday. The State System of Higher Education figures indicate loss of another 5,000-plus students this fall, dropping the universities’ total enrollment below 89,000 students – a level not seen in more than three decades, dating nearly to the system’s founding, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. PennLive.com reports the percentage drop in enrollment was the highest in well over two decades. System officials earlier warned state lawmakers and others that the 2021-22 year would be a “very challenging” one for enrollment, citing factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The system, founded in 1983, saw its enrollment peak at about 119,500 students in 2010 but saw the total drop to 94,000 last year. A review of system data indicates that the current total below 89,000 is lower than in any year since 1989, the Post-Gazette reports. Chancellor Dan Greenstein said the drop likely stems from the pandemic finally catching up with the system, which had avoided the declines other institutions saw last year. He said anecdotal accounts point to the pandemic’s impact on family incomes and students taking advantage of $15 and $20 per hour wages some firms are offering.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza wants to spend up to $1.6 million in federal coronavirus relief funding to establish nonviolence training and youth mentorship programs to address an increase in violence in the city. Providence recently opened requests for proposals for both initiatives, planning to allocate up to $500,000 in American Rescue Plan funds for training and up to $1.1 million for mentorship. Elorza said the idea began taking shape in May when nine people were injured in a shooting. “I reached out to some community leaders, sort of on the front line of things, and I asked them to put me in contact with families, mothers who had lost children, people who were either on parole or on probation, but were trying to turn their life around, and other folks who are on the front lines of living and working with these issues,” Elorza said. It became clear that the city was in need of more opportunities for youth, he said. There have been 20 homicides in the city this year. The five-year average for this point in the year is 11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair returns Wednesday after a hiatus brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year’s event was drive-thru only due to a high number of COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Department of Health and Environmental Control officials reported that such cases have dropped below 1,000 for the first time since July. More than 50% of South Carolinians are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the virus. State fair officials have instituted new protocols to prevent the virus’s spread, including increased cleaning, hygiene signage, hand sanitizer stations and reminding guests that in Columbia they must wear a face covering, WIS-TV reports. Guests are also encouraged to socially distance, use card and touchless methods for payments, and not come to the fair if they aren’t feeling well. The event, which runs through Oct. 24, includes rides, food, agriculture and livestock shows, crafts, art and a cookie kitchen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers redrawing the state’s political boundaries kicked off a three-day tour of public input meetings Monday amid intraparty Republican bickering and competing proposals for new legislative districts. The House and Senate committees, both dominated by Republicans, had previously sought accord in the once-in-a-decade process. But at a public input meeting in Box Elder, the schism between the House and Senate was on full display during the tour, dubbed “the redistricting roadshow” by lawmakers. The Legislature will convene Nov. 8 to consider new political boundaries, which must also be approved by Gov. Kristi Noem. If they can’t reach a consensus by Dec. 1, redistricting would be determined by the state Supreme Court. As Republicans accused each other of gerrymandering and “D.C. political tactics,” members of Native American communities used the meetings to press for greater representation in the Legislature. At the first meeting Monday, advocates pushed for compact political boundaries around northern Rapid City, which has a large number of Native Americans, that would allow the community to elect someone who represents its interests. The lawmakers are making seven stops this week, culminating with two meetings in Sioux Falls on Wednesday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday slightly tweaked his order requiring Knox County schools to implement a school mask mandate, saying officials would be allowed to approve exemptions on a case-by-case basis. In his 14-page ruling, however, U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer warned school officials – who had previously refused to adopt a mask mandate amid the COVID-19 outbreak – that the new mask exemption policy must not be abused. “The court reminds the Knox County Board of Education that its school system is no longer under a voluntary mask mandate; rather, it is under a court-ordered mask mandate,” Greer wrote. “The record evidence supports the need for – and the court ordered – a universal mask mandate, and the court fully expects its mask mandate to be exactly that: universal, to every possible extent, with ‘very few’ medical exemptions.” The Knox County Board of Education must file monthly status reports that identify not only the number of exemptions for students, employees and visitors but also the specific reasons for the exemptions. Greer said he would impose “considerable sanctions” if the education board did not comply with his latest order.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state’s child welfare agency is being accused of removing a webpage that provided information about a suicide prevention hotline and other resources for young LGBTQ people, following criticism by one of Gov. Greg Abbott’s primary challengers. The Houston Chronicle reports Abbott challenger Don Huffines posted a video on Twitter in August accusing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services of “promoting transgender sexual policies to Texas youth.” Within hours of the video being posted, the webpage was removed. The page appeared in a section of the agency’s website called “Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation.” Also gone was the entire website for the Texas Youth Connection, a division of Family and Protective Services that steers young people in foster care to various resources, including education, housing and those on its LGBTQ page. “These are not Texas values, these are not Republican Party values, but these are obviously Greg Abbott’s values,” Huffines said in his video. Abbott, who appoints the department’s commissioner and nine-member council, didn’t respond to the newspaper’s request for comment. Agency communications obtained through a public records request show that employees discussed removing the page in response to Huffines’ tweet.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Lawyers for Gov. Spencer Cox’s former campaign manager, who resigned last week after an investigation substantiated claims of sexual misconduct made against him by a female campaign employee, are calling the accusations baseless. In a statement Friday, lawyers representing Austin Cox said the relationship in question was a long-term one between two young adults that he ended earlier this year, KUTV reports. “Our client unequivocally and emphatically denies any allegations to the contrary,” the statement said. The Republican governor said Thursday that an independent investigation found cause to terminate Austin Cox, his 2020 campaign manager, but he resigned before its completion. The investigation also revealed previously unreported “hostile conduct” toward other members of the team. Austin Cox’s attorneys on Friday additionally criticized a joint statement from the governor and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson on Thursday that condemned the former campaign manager’s behavior. KUTV requested to speak with Austin Cox on Friday, but his attorney declined their request for an interview. The governor and former campaign manager are not related.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: An Abraham Lincoln statue at a museum was vandalized with the number “38,” which police say they believe is a reference to the execution of 38 Native Americans ordered by the former president in 1862. Police said an employee at the Bennington Museum arrived Sunday morning to find a large “LAND BACK” banner had been put up between two light poles at the entrance to the museum’s courtyard. The Lincoln statue in the courtyard had reddish spray paint on its face and hands, along with the number “38” painted on its chest, police said. Officials said it is expected to cost several thousand dollars to repair the statue and remove the paint. Police said they believe the vandalism is a reference to the Dakota 38, who were executed after the 1862 Dakota War, also known as the Sioux Uprising of 1862. A military commission sentenced 303 Sioux fighters to be executed. Lincoln reviewed the cases and decided there was evidence that 39 Sioux were guilty of murder or rape during the uprising and ordered their execution. The remaining 264 sentences were commuted. One of those sentenced to be executed received a reprieve. The Bennington Museum describes itself as a museum of art, history and innovation.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Former President Barack Obama will campaign with fellow Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the final stretch of the gubernatorial race. “The stakes could not be greater,” McAuliffe said as he announced the news Tuesday morning on MSNBC. McAuliffe’s race against the GOP nominee, first-time political candidate Glenn Youngkin, is tightening, according to the latest polls. His effort to win a second, nonconsecutive term in office is one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races in the country this year and is being closely watched for indications of voter sentiment ahead of next year’s midterms. McAuliffe’s campaign announced that Obama will join him in Richmond on Oct. 23 to mobilize Virginians during early voting, which began weeks ago and runs in person through Oct. 30. Obama rallied Democrats in Virginia’s capital city in 2017 before Ralph Northam beat Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie by nearly 9 percentage points. He’ll follow other high-profile Democrats visiting the commonwealth to support McAuliffe. First lady Jill Biden is set to visit on Friday. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist, grassroots organizer and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, will campaign with McAuliffe in Norfolk and northern Virginia on Sunday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Rewards totaling $2.5 million are now being offered for information that helps solve the killing of federal prosecutor Thomas C. Wales in Seattle 20 years ago. Nicholas Brown, newly sworn in as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington, announced Monday at a ceremony marking the anniversary of Wales’ death that the Justice Department had doubled its reward to $2 million, in addition to about $500,000 being offered by the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys. Brown also said his office – long recused from the case – is taking on leadership of the investigation, as there are few remaining assistant U.S. attorneys in Seattle who worked with Wales. The investigation had been overseen by a special prosecutor in New York, Steve Clymer; transferring the oversight to Seattle will allow for fresh eyes and additional resources, Brown said. “Twenty years is far too long for this crime – this attack on the American justice system – to go unresolved,” Brown said. Wales was an 18-year veteran of the U.S. attorney’s office who focused on white-collar crime and also served as president of a gun-control group called Washington CeaseFire. A gunman shot him through a basement window of his home Oct. 11, 2001.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers endorsed proposed maps of congressional and state legislative districts during a special session on redistricting Monday, setting up a potential fight between two of the state’s current members of Congress. West Virginia lost one of its three U.S. House seats after the 2020 census, and lawmakers are trying to redraw the state into two congressional districts. In the proposed map, Rep. David McKinley and Rep. Alex Mooney would be in the same district. All three current U.S. House members from West Virginia are Republicans. The state Senate redistricting committee forwarded its versions of congressional and state Senate maps Monday. Earlier in the day, a map that reconfigures all 100 House of Delegates seats into separate, single-member districts was endorsed by a House committee. The maps now go before the committees’ respective full chambers. The congressional redistricting map endorsed by the House committee would split the state roughly into north and south sections. The 1st District would include both panhandles and much of the northern part of the state along with Wood County on the western edge. The 2nd District would include the southern coalfields and the Greenbrier Valley, extending north into Ritchie County.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s Democratic attorney general, who represents the state elections commission, on Monday called for a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election to be shut down, saying it is a partisan political effort that lacks credibility, wastes taxpayer money and is not serious. “This investigation suffers from glaring flaws that destroy any credibility its results could have had,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said at a news conference. “Shut this fake investigation down.” Kaul’s comments came after the Republican leader of the Assembly election committee said she’s been kept out of the loop and doesn’t agree with moves being made by the leader of the probe. The latest twists comes after Michael Gableman, the retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading the investigation, issued a video over the weekend taking aim at Gov. Tony Evers. The Democratic governor told local election officials they should be “lawyered up” and called the taxpayer-funded investigation a “$700,000 boondoggle.” Gableman called that “an incomplete and misguided view” of the probe. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ordered the investigation under pressure from Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Rapper, music producer and clothing entrepreneur Kanye West has put his ranch and business properties in northwestern Wyoming up for sale. The West Ranch, formerly known as Monster Lake Ranch, went on the market Monday for $11 million. The property sprawls across 6 square miles of open land and tree-studded hills and outcrops about 6 miles south of Cody. The property features lakes, a lodge, a commercial kitchen, equipment sheds, a horse facility, corrals and a go-kart track, according to the DBW Realty listing. The listing came days after West listed his seven commercial properties in Cody for more than $3.2 million, the Cody Enterprise reports. The ranch, which leases additional land owned by the U.S. government, was listed for $13.3 million before West bought it in 2019, though it’s unknown how much he paid for the property. Wyoming law does not provide for public disclosure of real estate sale amounts. West moved from California to Wyoming in 2019 and set about basing at least some of his clothing business in Cody, a city of about 10,000 on the eastern approach to Yellowstone National Park. It wasn’t clear if the property sales mean West is leaving Wyoming or just reorganizing his business there.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/05/18/k9-advantix-flea-tick-medicine-generic-bayer-tevra/70220325007/", "title": "Cheap flea and tick products elusive? Lawsuit claims it's intentional.", "text": "Emily Le Coz, USA TODAY and Johnathan Hettinger, Investigate Midwest\n\nPet owners paying for Advantage II and K9 Advantix II topical flea-and-tick treatments could have saved hundreds of dollars by now had they switched to the generic versions that first hit the market six years ago.\n\nBut first, they would have had to find them.\n\nCheaper equivalents for the blockbuster brands, which both kill and repel pests, have quietly eluded consumers for years. Even today, they’re nowhere to be found at many of the biggest pet specialty stores, like PetSmart or Petco. And they’re absent from popular online pet pharmacies like Chewy.com or PetMed Express.\n\nTheir elusiveness is not by accident, according to a federal lawsuit by one of the generic’s makers, but a scheme by the brand-name products’ company to block competition.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, the lawsuit by Tevra Brands offers a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of the multibillion-dollar pet medication market, where a few major companies have a stranglehold on pricing. Tevra’s suit claims it lost tens of millions of dollars because Bayer Animal Health, a former subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical giant, conspired to maintain its monopoly over the treatment it created.\n\nTevra sells its generic topical treatments for cats and dogs on its website, on Amazon and elsewhere, but the company argues that Bayer prevented it from reaching pet owners where they’re most likely to shop and depriving them of a better deal.\n\nIts line includes TevraPet Activate II for dogs and ActiSpot II for cats, as well as Vetality Avantect II for dogs and Advotect II for cats. Its ActiSpot II six-dose treatment for large cats cost $30 on Amazon.com, as of May 15. The brand-name equivalent, Advantage II for cats, cost more than twice as much – $64 – on Chewy.com.\n\nUnlike the human pharmaceutical industry which abounds in cheap alternatives once brand-name patent protection expires, the pet med market offers relatively few choices.\n\nJust 14% of federally approved animal drugs have a generic version, according to the Generic Animal Drug Alliance. Meanwhile, generics in human health care last year accounted for 9 out of 10 filled prescriptions, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAmong the many reasons for the difference is that human health insurance requires generic drug substitution whenever possible, which has spurred the development and availability of low-cost alternatives. Pet insurance is nowhere near as widespread or influential.\n\nThat allows pioneer drug companies – those that own the brand-name or patented versions – to dominate much of the pet medication market. And industry insiders have long decried their outsize leverage through exclusivity agreements.\n\nSuch agreements block vendors – including pet stores, online pharmacies and wholesale distributors that supply retailers and veterinarians – from selling products that directly compete with their brand-name goods.\n\nTied to those deals are often lucrative financial incentives such as discounts and rebates that vendors can ill afford to turn down, especially if their rivals are taking advantage of them.\n\nIt’s ‘price-fixing in its purest form’\n\nExclusive dealing is a common and legal practice in many industries, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws. The practice can encourage distributors and retailers to specialize in specific products and offer consumers related services and amenities.\n\nWhen big companies use them to choke rivals out of the market, however, the deals become unlawful and the FTC can intervene.\n\nThe agency has known about the dubious use of exclusivity deals in the pet medication market since at least 2012; industry stakeholders complained about it during a public workshop the FTC hosted that year “to examine competition and consumer protection issues in the pet medications industry.”\n\nA representative of the Generic Animal Drug Alliance told the agency she knew of at least two large drug companies whose agreements banned national distributors from carrying the generic versions, or any similar versions, of their brand-name products.\n\nThe alliance’s then-chairperson, Jennifer S. Johansson, said in a statement sent to the FTC that such deals limit the availability of generic treatments and drive up consumer prices. She didn’t name any companies.\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, Vicky Graham, a spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment on whether the agency investigated any such complaints raised during or after the workshop. It appears, though, the FTC took no action; it deemed the evidence and effects of the agreements presented at the workshop contradictory, according to a staff summary report.\n\nThe report was published in 2015, just as Tevra Brands was being formed. Two years later, the Omaha, Nebraska-based startup says it learned for itself the effects of the agreements.\n\nIt’s “price-fixing in its purest form,” Tevra said in its complaint against Bayer, which it initially filed in 2019 and has amended twice. “The only losers in the deal were consumers who were forced to pay higher prices, generic manufacturers such as Tevra that were foreclosed from competition, and the rule of law as enshrined in the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act.”\n\nThe Sherman Act prohibits actual or attempted monopolization, as well as any contracts and conspiracies that result in the unreasonable restraint of trade. The Clayton Act bans certain discriminatory prices or services between merchants, as well as mergers and acquisitions that restrict competition.\n\nTevra claimed in its lawsuit that Bayer’s scheme cost it more than $76 million in net profits that it would have earned on the sale of those products from 2017 through 2021.\n\nBayer denied Tevra’s allegations in court filings. It said Tevra failed to make a case that Bayer intended to, or even succeeded in, blocking generics from the market. Bayer claimed that its agreements with distributors and retailers were legal and provided only “modest incentives” for exclusivity but did not require it.\n\nEven if the deals blocked Tevra’s generics from the online and brick-and-mortar pet specialty stores – which Bayer denied – Bayer said Tevra could still sell elsewhere, including directly to consumers on websites like Amazon, or through veterinarians.\n\nBut Tevra said in its lawsuit that it does not market its over-the-counter generics to veterinarians, most of whom prefer private-label brands. And its lack of name recognition makes direct-to-consumer sales difficult. Without access to the biggest pet retailers, the lawsuit said, Tevra's financial aspirations were dashed.\n\nBayer sold its entire animal health division in 2020 to Elanco, an animal health business spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., for $7.6 billion. Although Elanco is not named as a party in the lawsuit, it is now responsible for defending the case. It said in its latest Securities and Exchange Commission report in March that it intends “to defend our position vigorously.”\n\nUSA TODAY asked Elanco if the company has maintained any exclusivity agreements in effect at the time of the acquisition, but Colleen Dekker, a spokeswoman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Elanco’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nBayer’s parent company, Bayer AG, is no longer a party in the case, nor is its Bayer Healthcare subsidiary, both of which initially were named as defendants, along with its former animal health division. Bayer AG spokesman Philipp Blank had no comment other than to note the company’s lack of involvement.\n\nTevra did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Polsinelli Law Firm, which represents Tevra, said attorneys there are unable to discuss the lawsuit.\n\nThe case, which has survived several motions to dismiss, is still in the discovery and deposition stages. It could go to trial as early as July 2024.\n\n‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired’\n\nEven before it won federal approval to sell its line of generics in May 2017, Tevra had hired a sales team to pitch it to major pet product distributors, retailers and e-pharmacies for pets.\n\nTevra had expected to sell nearly $10 million of the topicals the first year and projected steady annual sales revenues of nearly $30 million by 2019. Instead, it sold less than $600,000 worth in the first year as, one by one, distributors and retailers turned the company down, citing the “no generics” agreements with Bayer, its lawsuit claims.\n\nThat included at least two major national distributors: Veterinary Service and Animal Supply Company.\n\nIn March 2017, according to the lawsuit, a Veterinary Service representative told a Tevra salesperson they weren’t sure whether the “Bayer agreement” allowed them to purchase another product made with imidacloprid and would have to find out. Imidacloprid, an insecticide, is the key ingredient in both the brand name and generic versions of the flea and tick treatment.\n\nUltimately, the company chose not to purchase Tevra’s topicals.\n\nAnimal Supply Company “was even more explicit when its agent told a Tevra salesperson in March 2021 that they could not purchase ‘any products with Imidacloprid’ from Tevra because of an agreement with Bayer, and added ‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired,’” according to the lawsuit.\n\nSimilar statements were made by representatives of PetMed Express, which owns 1-800-PetMeds; Drs. Foster & Smith, which is now Petco.com; and Chewy.com, the lawsuit said.\n\nA representative of Chewy.com told Tevra if they bought its imidacloprid generics, they’d forfeit a huge rebate from Bayer.\n\nWithout the rebate, the lawsuit said, Chewy.com, “would lose $3 million dollars in net margin taking into account the reduced Bayer rebate vs. what they thought they would make” selling Tevra’s imidacloprid products.\n\nAt least one national pet retail chain that bought Tevra’s products still got discounts from Bayer by agreeing not to say the generics “compared to” the brand name versions in store displays or on websites and advertisements, the lawsuit said. The discount applied not just to the spot-on treatments, but an entire bundle of Bayer products, including the popular Seresto flea-and-tick collar.\n\n“This restriction severely handicapped the sale of the generic Imidacloprid topical at Pet Supplies Plus,” Tevra said in its lawsuit.\n\nIn court filings, defendants dispute Tevra’s allegations that Bayer had a “no generics” agreement with retailers or that it used discounts to block generic competition.\n\nBayer’s marketing efforts “in no way point to the existence of an exclusive dealing arrangement, much less the who, what, where, and when of an extra-contractual conspiracy,” defendants said in a 2021 motion to dismiss the case. They described Bayer’s purchase agreements with retailers as being of “short duration and easy terminability.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the vendors cited in the lawsuit for comment. Petco.com and Chewy.com did not respond; PetMed and Animal Supply declined to comment.\n\nLoyal Burns, chief operating officer at Veterinary Service, said he doesn't recall Tevra Brands pitching its products and denied that his company ever had a “no generics\" agreement with Bayer.\n\nFlea-and-tick products market grows as Americans spend more on pets\n\nMore Americans own pets than at any time in recent history, and more of them treat their fur babies like members of the family. Nothing’s too good for Fluffy and Fido and, last year alone, we collectively spent $137 billion on them – from pet food and supplies to boarding and veterinary care.\n\nThat’s more than double spending from a decade ago.\n\nA sizable chunk went toward flea-and-tick treatments, according to the 2023-2024 American Pet Products Association’s National Pet Owners Survey. Roughly 6 in 10 dog owners use some form of flea-and-tick treatment, ranging from collars and shampoos to pills or spot-ons, for which they spent an average of $92 in the past year, the survey said.\n\nUsage was less common among cat owners – about 4 in 10 collectively spent an average of $76 over the same timeframe.\n\nThose numbers have climbed from the group’s previous survey. And there’s no slow down in sight, especially as veterinarians and public health officials push for more pets to use them.\n\n\"Preventing tick bites on people and pets is a critical issue,” said tick expert Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island. Mather added that protecting pets also protects humans from the many diseases these pests can carry.\n\nBut consumer surveys show that cost is the top reason people don’t protect their pets from fleas and ticks, Mather said. And cost can vary significantly depending on how the products are marketed and where they’re sold.\n\nCompanies typically develop different lines of the same product, each with a different price: a generic line that offers the best value; a brand-name line that’s modestly priced; and an exclusive veterinary line that’s more expensive, according to the lawsuit and industry experts.\n\nNovartis said its generic topical was blocked, too\n\nVeterinarians have long relied on product sales for a significant chunk of income, and for many years, they were often the sole supplier of such treatments. Vets used to be able to mark up prices by as much as 100%, said John Volk, a senior consultant for Brakke Consulting focusing on the animal health industry.\n\nOnline and retail competition has cut into that markup, though. The industry standard for flea-and tick-treatments today is about 65%, according to the American Animal Hospital Association.\n\nMost people, Mather said, \"want to buy the less expensive product they think is the same.\"\n\nBut while generics offer the best bang for the buck, exclusivity deals have interfered with their widespread availability. Even big pharmaceutical firms have been thwarted in efforts to get their generics to the masses.\n\nNovartis, itself a major drug company, couldn’t overcome the exclusivity deals it blamed for dooming one of its generic pet medications, its then-Animal Health Division Vice President Clinton Vranian said at the 2012 FTC workshop.\n\nVranian, who did not name the branded product or its generic equivalent, said the generic was more effective than the brand name version and well-received by veterinarians, but distributors wouldn’t touch it.\n\nNovartis achieved just 1%-2% market penetration in the drug’s launch, Vranian said.\n\nEli Lilly and Co., the pharmaceutical giant that used to own Elanco, acquired Novartis in 2015.\n\nElanco’s spokeswoman at the time revealed the generic product as Parastar Plus, a flea-and-tick treatment that directly competed with the brand name version, Frontline, then owned by Merial, according to a story by VIN News Service, which serves the veterinary industry.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Christina Diane Gaines, told the news service that Elanco itself does not use blocking agreements.\n\n“Elanco believes competition drives innovation in the industry, which results in greater customer benefit,” the article quotes Gaines as saying. “Our product strategy is focused on investing in innovation over restrictive contracts.”\n\nElanco’s current spokeswoman, Colleen Dekker, declined to answer a question from USA TODAY about whether the company still eschews such agreements.\n\n“Because this is part of pending litigation,” Dekker said, “we don’t have any further comment beyond what’s in our legal documentation.”\n\nGenerics give consumers ‘lower prices and more choices’\n\nNot all flea-and-tick treatments are the same.\n\nProducts like Frontline Plus, whose active ingredient is fipronil, are effective at killing fleas, ticks and lice only after they’ve bitten pets. Treatments made with imidacloprid, like K9 Advantix II, not only kill, but repel the parasites, making them more effective at preventing the spread of flea-and-tick-borne diseases.\n\nBy the time Tevra came along, the market for fipronil-based topical treatments was saturated. Frontline, first introduced in 1997, faced a host of generic competition starting in 2011 and, by 2018, had lost more than half its market share, according to Tevra’s lawsuit.\n\n“The results of generic Fipronil topicals entering the separate market for Fipronil topicals have been more competition against Frontline, lower prices, and more choices for retailers and consumers in that market,” Tevra’s lawsuit said.\n\nTevra decided to introduce its own line of fipronil-based generic topicals, which includes Vetality Firstect Plus and TevraPet FirstAct Plus, from which it anticipated modest revenues. But, according to the lawsuit, it believed its biggest moneymaker would be in the imidacloprid market, where, at the time of the company’s founding, only one line of treatments was available: Bayer’s.\n\nTevra hoped to capture a large chunk of the untapped market – with earnings potentials 10 times greater than that of its fipronil line – by being one of the first to roll out a generic equivalent.\n\nWhen another company with the same plan, CAP IM Supply, introduced its generic line a few months before Tevra, in January 2017, Bayer sued for patent infringement. The parties settled two years later.\n\nAs part of that settlement, CAP IM Supply had to pay Bayer royalties on its generic products, which allowed Bayer to maintain a monopoly of the imidacloprid-based topical flea-and-tick market, Tevra’s lawsuit said, since it earned money from both its brand-name line and the generic equivalent.\n\nBecause Tevra’s formulation differs from the patented version, the lawsuit said, it does not infringe on Bayer’s patents.\n\nHow the Brown Shoe case factors into flea-and-tick treatments\n\nThe outcome of the case likely will hinge on which side’s definition of the “relevant market” prevails, said R. Mark McCareins, a clinical professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who spent three decades litigating antitrust cases for a global law firm.\n\nTevra’s lawsuit defined the relevant market as one that includes only topical, squeeze-on flea-and-tick treatments whose active ingredient is imidacloprid.\n\nSeveral product lines fit that definition, most notably: Bayer’s brand-name Advantage and Advantix series, now owned by Elanco; the generic Advecta and PetLock series for which CAP IM Supply pays royalties; and Tevra’s Activate, ActiSpot, Avantect and Advotect products, which have struggled to gain a foothold.\n\nBayer made roughly 85% of all sales in that market in 2018 and earned patent license royalties for most of the other 15%, Tevra said in its lawsuit, arguing that Bayer effectively had monopolized the market.\n\nOther generic imidacloprid topicals also are now on the market, but are equally absent from major pet specialty stores and online pharmacies. They include, PetArmor Max, Adventure Plus for Dogs and Amazon Basics Flea, Tick & Mosquito Topical.\n\nBut Bayer argued the market encompasses all flea-and-tick treatments regardless of insecticide or delivery method. That includes fipronil topicals like Frontline, as well as shampoos and collars, Bayer said.\n\nIn that case, Bayer said, the brand name Advantage and Advantix products represent a fraction of the market and its contractual agreements did nothing to block Tevra from fairly competing.\n\nCourts determine a product’s relevant market based on which other products consumers would reasonably consider a substitute for it. And within that market may exist separate submarkets, which courts determine by considering things such as the product’s “peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors,” according to the landmark antitrust case, Brown Shoe v. United States.\n\nThe Brown Shoe case, in which the government sought to block the merger of two of the nation’s then-biggest shoe manufacturers and retailers, set the standard for this process more than 60 years ago and is still used today.\n\nBoth sides cited Brown Shoe in various court filings.\n\n“If Bayer is able to convince the court that its broader market definition conforms better to the legal requirements – set forth first before (the U.S. Supreme Court) in a case called Brown Shoe in 1962 – then Bayer is a likely winner in the case,” McCareins said. “Alternatively, through the same type of evidence, if the plaintiff prevails in its narrow market definition, then the odds shift in its favor.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Called the Nexx360, the officer’s collar holds four wide-angle cameras. Instead of capturing footage of a narrow field of view in front of the officer, this system gives an all-around view. “This has the potential for being a game-changer,” said Sheriff John Shearon. “There are times when we don’t get good footage of an encounter. The officer may be moving to protect themselves or others; the other person may be moving. An officer doesn’t need to think about where they need to be to get the best body camera footage. This solves that problem.” The cameras serve as a “dispassionate observer,” said Terry Luck, a longtime defense attorney whose practice is in Montgomery. The technology also allows dispatchers – and supervisors – to get real-time images of what’s happening. That’s a huge advantage in rural counties, where help in the form of backup can be 20 minutes or more away, Shearon said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she recently tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on social media, Murkowski said she recently tested positive after experiencing flulike symptoms. The statement did not specify the timing of the test. Her campaign posted photos of events that Murkowski participated in Friday and Saturday in Fairbanks. “I will be following guidance and advice from doctors and will be quarantining at home in Alaska while continuing my work remotely,” Murkowski’s statement said. Karina Borger, a spokesperson in Murkowski’s Senate office, said by email that Murkowski is “vaccinated and boosted.” Borger said she had nothing more to share beyond the social media post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Beginning this month, students whose jobs or income were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can receive free tuition, monthly stipends and employment help in a range of workforce programs from manufacturing to health care at Maricopa County’s 10 community colleges. Phoenix is using $7 million of its federal pandemic relief funds to finance the “Route to Relief” program, which will run through December 2024. Eligible students can get up to $5,000 for tuition, fees and books. Training-related expenses, job search expenses and career services in programs such as semiconductor, health care, business, manufacturing and information technology also are covered. Students also will get monthly stipends during their studies of up to $1,500 for other expenses such as child care and transportation.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Power has been restored across the Arkansas River Valley after storms last week caused outages in Roland, Oklahoma and Paris. But a heat wave will continue through the first part of this week with triple-digit temperatures in Fort Smith. There is a 50% chance for rain Thursday with a high of 98 degrees, the National Weather Service reported. An excessive heat warning was issued for 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday in Fort Smith and Sebastian County. High fire danger continues during an ongoing drought.\n\nCalifornia\n\nForest Falls: A man died and a woman was injured when the pair tumbled down a waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains, authorities said. Rescue crews responding Sunday afternoon found the woman performing CPR on the man at Big Falls near the community of Forest Falls, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said. The man, a 43-year-old resident of Hemet, died at the scene, the department said. The 43-year-old woman from Riverside was airlifted to a hospital, officials said. Their names were not immediately available. Officials said the pair fell from the middle falls to the lower falls at the popular destination along a hiking trail about 80 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has temporarily blocked the city of Superior from enforcing parts of a new gun control ordinance, including a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons, after it was challenged by gun rights groups. U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Moore issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, noting the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, the National Association for Gun Rights and a Superior resident, Charles Bradley Walker, had established a likelihood to prove their case in challenging two sections of the ordinance. Moore scheduled an Aug. 4 hearing to determine whether to continue to keep Superior from enforcing those sections. The other section requires people who had assault weapons before the law took effect on July 1 to get a permit to continue to possess them but largely only on their own property. The law defines assault weapons as a number of different semi-automatic weapons. Moore’s ruling included several references to last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a New York law that required people to show why they needed a concealed weapons permit. He noted that the court found that Americans have the right to bear commonly used arms in public, subject to reasonable and well-defined restrictions, and that governments must identify “an American tradition” to justify any limits on their use.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The City Council gave the green light to the Norwich Community Development Corporation to apply for a $500,000 Brownfield Remediation Grant from the state’s Community Investment Fund to help remediate and redevelop the Reid and Hughes department store, a vacant building on Main Street. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the funding is needed to take care of asbestos, lead pipes, and other areas that aren’t up to modern code compliance. The plan for the building is to create 17 apartments and a first-floor retail space. Heritage Housing, Inc. is the developer interested in the Reid and Hughes building. It already owns the Wauregan Building across the street.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Senate Democrats voted in a special session to seek to remove Delaware’s state auditor from office, an action criticized as meaningless “political theater” by the Democratic House speaker. Senators voted 13-7 for a resolution to hold a joint session of the Legislature regarding the removal of Auditor Kathy McGuiness, a Democrat. Senate Democrats contend that McGuiness should be removed from office for betraying the public trust. McGuiness, who is responsible as auditor for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was convicted this month on misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest, official misconduct and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. She was acquitted on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. The case marked the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official had been convicted on criminal charges. The Senate resolution must also be approved by the House, but Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf said he has no intention of calling his chamber into special session. “This isn’t taking decisive action: it’s political theater,” Schwartzkopf, a longtime political ally of McGuiness, said in a statement issued by Democratic House leadership.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police are investigating after a 7-year-old boy was hit by a car driven by an 11-year-old boy in Southeast D.C. on Monday night, WUSA-TV reported. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the unidentified boy was hit in a playground parking lot, located on the 3500 block of Stanton Road, just after 6:30 p.m. Police believe the juvenile driver lost control of the car and wasn't able to hit the brake before running into the child. The car also hit a curb. When first responders arrived, they found the boy conscious and breathing. The 11-year-old driver of a 2020 Kia Optima ran away from the scene after the crash, but was located by police Tuesday. The family of the injured boy said he is expected to be OK, but he is recovering from a leg injury in the hospital.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Four people, including a 5-year-old boy, were injured when a car crashed through an unoccupied toll booth and ended up in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said. The crash happened just before 5 p.m. Sunday along Daytona Beach, where vehicles are allowed on the sand. The driver of the car, Christian Rivera Rosado, 28, of Springfield, Massachusetts, apparently had a seizure and lost control of his Nissan Altima, according to a report from Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. The car smashed through the empty toll booth at the International Speedway Boulevard beach approach in Daytona Beach and ended up in the water, Volusia County Beach Safety officials told news outlets. The child, identified as David Alamos of Nashville, Tennessee, was taken to a hospital in Daytona Beach and then airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. The child he was released from Halifax Health Medical Center later Sunday. Rosado was also taken to the hospital as a trauma alert, the report said. Rosado, who said he didn’t remember the incident, was cited for careless driving, the report stated. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection. The five voters from Greene’s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A swimmer at a beach in Waikiki was injured last weekend after encountering an endangered Hawaiian monk seal with a young pup. Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a nonprofit conservation organization that helps monitor protected species, said their workers witnessed a swimmer come into contact with the mother monk seal known as Rocky on Sunday morning. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement the victim is a 60-year-old elementary school teacher from California. The woman received lacerations to her face, arm and back, the agency said. State officials said they would not recommend charges or fines for the woman and are not naming her because she requested anonymity. The Hawaii Marine Animal Response said in a statement the seal gave birth to a pup about two weeks ago on Kaimana Beach in Waikiki, the same area where the swimmer was injured. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Marine Animal Response have been watching the pair and warning people to stay away. It is against the law to touch, harass, injure or kill monk seals, of which there are less than 1,600 remaining in the wild. People are told to stay at least 150 feet away from a mother seal and pup, though that recommendation is not a law.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Tom Arkoosh, an attorney from Boise, said he’s running for Idaho attorney general as the Democratic nominee. Arkoosh announced his candidacy amid family and friends at the Statehouse. He’s replacing Steve Scanlin, who withdrew from the race last week and was a placeholder for the Democrats. Arkoosh will face former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador in the November general election. Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the May Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man who died after being stabbed on a commuter train early Monday apparently threatened or tried to rob the person who wounded him, authorities said. The stabbing occurred at about 3 a.m. on a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line train on the city’s South Side, police said. Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said video footage reviewed by investigators suggested the man was with a group who threatened or tried to rob someone else on the train. Video showed the man holding a gun before the individual targeted by the group used a knife to stab him, Deenihan said during a news conference. The man suffered wounds to his chest and later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Deenihan said investigators haven’t identified anyone else involved yet. No arrests have been made.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Thousands of people arguing the abortion issue surrounded the Statehouse and filled its corridors Monday as lawmakers began to consider a Republican proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the effort during a meeting with Democratic state legislators. Harris said the abortion ban proposal reflected a health care crisis in the country. Despite the bill’s abortion ban language, anti-abortion activists lined up before a legislative committee to argue the bill wasn’t strict enough and lacked enforcement teeth. Indiana is one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court decision last month overturning Roe v. Wade. Indiana’s Republican Senate leaders proposed a bill last week that would prohibit abortions from the time an egg is implanted in a woman’s uterus with limited exceptions – in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. Republican Senate leaders said the bill would not add new criminal penalties against doctors involved with abortions, but they would face possibly having their medical licenses revoked for breaking the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:As three more families sue Tyson Foods over COVID-19 deaths among workers at its Iowa plants, the meatpacking giant is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for protection. Tyson’s attorneys filed the petition Friday, asking the country’s highest court to hear their case and rule that a March 2020 executive order by President Donald Trump shielded the company from legal liability, Bloomberg Law reported. Trump’s order instructed the secretary of agriculture to take “all appropriate action” to keep the country’s meat and chicken processing plants open as COVID-19 spread, though it did not prohibit them from temporarily closing their plants. In their petition, according to Bloomberg, Tyson’s attorneys wrote the company followed “the federal government’s instructions to help avert an impending national food shortage.” They added that Tyson executives “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if the company is subject to lawsuits.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt is trying to get ahead of arguments that an anti-abortion measure up for a statewide vote next week would hinder medical care for patients with life-threatening pregnancies. Schmidt, a Republican running for governor who supports the measure, argued in a legal opinion issued Friday that treating miscarriages, removing dead fetuses and ending ectopic pregnancies do not fall under Kansas’ legal definition of abortion. The proposal on the ballot Aug. 2 would amend the Kansas Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. It’s the first referendum on abortion policy by a state since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Funding is available to help boost the Kentucky tourism industry, which saw a decline in visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The state will allocate $75 million over the next several weeks to help eligible tourism organizations that apply and show the impact of the virus, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act and was allocated by the General Assembly earlier this year. It will be distributed in four ways. Officials said $25 million will go to local tourism commissions to market their communities, $25 million will be used to attract conventions and meetings, $15 million will go toward statewide marketing and $10 million will be available for multicounty collaborations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Mayor-President Josh Guillory said he has checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcohol addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Guillory said in a news release he will be at an in-patient facility for 21 days. A statement from the city said Guillory will remain in authority over Lafayette Parish and city government. Through arrangements with the facility, Guillory will have access to a computer and internet service and will be able to review and sign contracts, ordinances and other documents. Guillory’s biography on the city’s website said he enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard in 2001 and led a platoon in Iraq in 2005.\n\nMaine\n\nNewry: A decision by state regulators could make it difficult for the owners of a potentially rich lithium deposit in western Maine to extract the metal. The owners of the Newry property asked the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to review the possibility of quarrying at the site. However, regulators decided earlier this month the site would be viewed as a metallic mineral mine and not a quarry operation, said Maine mining coordinator Michael Clark on Monday. Maine’s mineral mining laws are among the strictest in the country. The Freeman family, which owns the land, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. New sources of lithium are in demand in the U.S. because the metal is crucial to the development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid cars.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Democratic U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger has tested positive for the coronoavirus, his office said Monday. Ruppersberger, who represents Maryland’s 2nd District, tested positive on Sunday night. The congressman’s symptoms are mild and he is working from home while isolating, his office said. He is fully vaccinated and has had a booster shot. Ruppersberger, 76, is serving his 10th term in Congress. This is the second time this year that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He also had a positive test in January and reported mild symptoms at the time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: After a whale crashed into a fishing boat and others were seen off the South Shore coast in the past week, the state is warning boaters to use caution as a group of young humpbacks feeds in Plymouth Harbor. The state’s environmental agencies have warned all boaters, kayakers, paddleboarders and others on the water to watch out for three juvenile humpback whales that have been feeding near Plymouth for at least a week. The young whales’ behavior is “very unpredictable,” the state said, and they are feeding on schools of fish in shallow waters. A whale on Sunday struck a fishing boat off the coast of Plymouth after breaching with several boats nearby. The whale hit one of the boats and caused the bow to dip down into the water. Two people on the boat braced themselves as the boat tipped forward and back, a video showed. A paddleboarder had a close encounter with a whale off Manomet last week, and amateur wildlife photographer Suzanne O’Shea managed to photograph a breaching whale off the coast of Plymouth on July 19. The whales feeding and breaching in the area have brought residents and tourists in the hopes of catching a glimpse. Most of the whales have been humpback, which can measure up to 55 feet and weigh up to 40 tons, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the conservation of whales. It is illegal to harass marine mammals under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act. Harassment includes any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that can injure or disrupt the feeding behavior of the animal. The National Marine Fisheries Service recommends that boaters stay at least 100 feet away from whales and take caution given the unpredictable behavior of whales and the potential safety hazards involved.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Dozens of University of Michigan medical students walked out of a weekend ceremony to protest a speaker who publicly opposes abortion rights. Dr. Kristin Collier, an assistant professor of medicine, was the keynote speaker Sunday at an annual event where new medical students are formally welcomed and given a white lab coat. A video of some students walking out was posted to social media and has received more than 11 million views. Collier didn’t refer to abortion in her remarks, but she has shared her opinions on social media and in interviews. A petition signed by 340 medical students, including some of the new ones, had urged the university to drop Collier as a speaker. Spokeswoman Mary Masson said the university “does not revoke an invitation to a speaker based on their personal beliefs.” Dr. Joseph Kolars, a senior associate dean, said Collier was nominated to speak by members of a medical school student honor society. He told the audience that she is an “enormously popular teacher and physician.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mekhi Speed, 18, a cousin of Amir Locke, was sentenced to more than 16 years for his role in a January murder that prompted police to execute a no-knock warrant on the apartment where Locke was killed by a SWAT team officer. Speed pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony – namely aggravated robbery – in connection with the Jan. 10 killing of 38-year-old Otis Elder. Speed, who was 17 when Elder was shot, told the court during his plea hearing that he had a handgun when he and others tried to rob Elder of drugs in St. Paul, and there was a struggle and a shot was fired. Speed said he had no memory of pulling the trigger and didn’t know if his accomplice was armed. As St. Paul police were investigating Elder’s murder, they identified Speed as a suspect and obtained search warrants for Minneapolis apartments associated with him. Locke, Speed’s cousin, was not a target of the investigation and was not named in the warrants, but he was in one of the apartments as a Minneapolis SWAT team entered the unit without knocking on Feb. 2. Video showed Locke, 22, who was Black, was shot seconds after police entered the apartment before 7 a.m. He was on a sofa wrapped in a comforter, and video showed he was holding a gun in the moments before he was shot. Minnesota prosecutors declined to file charges the against Officer Mark Hanneman, saying his use of deadly force was justified.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia: With a population of 64, the village of Satartia in Yazoo County is Mississippi’s smallest town, but it will soon hold a celebration of something unusually large – a fictional catfish named Eli that lives in the nearby Yazoo River. The Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River Festival on July 30 will be an evening of music, food, fireworks and might be one of the only festivals around where you can rent a catfish. “It’s going to be epic,” said Michele Harris, president and event coordinator of the non-profit Moving Satartia Forward. “It’s going to be so much fun.” Eli isn’t a real catfish. He’s the focus of an award-winning children’s book; Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River. He lives in the river under a bridge, which is a stone’s throw from the village. In the book, a boy and girl set out to do what no one has done – catch the legendary fish. Instead, they develop a friendship with Eli and become his protectors. Eli is now a part of the town’s identity. There’s even a 3,500-pound wooden sculpture of the fish in downtown Satartia created by artist Alexander Brown.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis has joined a growing list of Democrat-led cities seeking to help women gain abortion access, even in red states that have largely banned the procedure. Not long after Democratic Mayor Tishaura Jones signed a measure providing $1 million for travel to abortion clinics in other states, Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued to stop what he called a “blatantly illegal move to spend Missourians’ hard-earned tax dollars on out-of-state abortions.” The give-and-take is emblematic of city versus state fight playing out since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The St. Louis law called for using federal COVID-19 relief money for a “Reproductive Equity Fund.” The funding is part of a larger health care package that also offers postpartum support, lactation help, doula assistance and money for COVID-19 testing and vaccine incentives. Jones said during a news conference before signing the bill that she expected a lawsuit from Schmitt, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in the Aug. 2 primary, and who has filed dozens of lawsuits ranging from efforts to halt mask mandates in schools to a suit against China over the coronavirus.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A helicopter search crew looking for two missing Montana climbers in Glacier National Park spotted their bodies Monday, park officials said in a statement. The men, both 67, were reported overdue Sunday from their planned climb of Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s center. They set out for the climb on Thursday and planned to hike out on Friday. Park rangers found their vehicle at a trailhead Sunday and search crews first took to the air later that day, park officials said. Authorities were making a plan to recover the men’s bodies and their belongings, the park statement said. Their identities were not immediately disclosed.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts remains noncommittal about calling a special legislative session to address abortion, despite many Republican lawmakers pushing to outlaw the procedure. Abortion opponents don’t appear to have the 33-vote super majority needed to overcome a filibuster waged by abortion-rights supporters. Abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska. Those seeking an abortion must receive counseling and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. People under 19 must have parental consent to undergo an abortion.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thirteen Nevada Republicans announced a new coalition to endorse Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford in his re-election bid against their party’s nominee, Sigal Chattah, a conservative who bested a more moderate Republican primary contender. The announcement of “Republicans for Ford,” first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, signaled a major shift in party support as the group is headlined by a former rival of Ford’s – former state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, along with former GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian. Chattah won the June Republican primary by 11 percentage points over Tisha Black, a more moderate candidate who had the backing of Nevada’s Republican establishment. A Las Vegas-based lawyer, she is one of a few conservative GOP candidates in Nevada who won their primary races against more moderate opponents. Chattah sued Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak over pandemic restrictions on behalf of a church and has often painted Black as a Democratic sympathizer throughout the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state sued several pharmacy chains Tuesday, becoming the latest government entity seeking to hold them accountable for fueling the nation’s opioid epidemic. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General John Formella called CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and their subsidiaries “the last link in the opioid supply chain and the critical gatekeeper between dangerous opioid narcotics in the public.” It accused the companies of flouting their duty to protect public health and safety by failing to stop suspicious prescriptions and diverted drugs. Opioids – including prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly produced fentanyl – have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000, and the number of cases reached a record high in 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBernards: Capt. Robert Terry and his wife Estelle were posthumously awarded the Tuskegee Airmen Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony Thursday at the couple’s former home across from the original Somerset Hills Airfield off Lord Stirling Road. The gold medals were commissioned by President George W. Bush in 2001. “This is outstanding,” said Qaaim Saalik, son of Robert and Estelle Terry, accompanied by his daughters Malika Ra and Ramdasha Bikceem, cousin David Booker and close family friend Kumar Best. “I am very proud of them. I know my parents would look down on this occasion with great, great joy.” Brooks Betz, researcher for the Mr. Local History Project, campaigned for the couple’s honors. Over two years, he prepared a detailed story about the couple’s experiences with the Airmen. Robert Terry served as a Tuskegee Airmen flight instructor and pilot from 1943 to 1945. He helped train 992 pilots, 350 of whom were deployed in the war and served with distinction. A licensed pilot, Estelle Terry might have been the first Black woman pilot in New Jersey, Betz said. She also served among the 14,000-member ground support personnel as a mail clerk and packing parachutes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Mayor Tim Keller said the city’s most visible unsanctioned homeless encampment will close next month. Keller said the exact date for Coronado Park’s closing hasn’t been decided. City officials said an estimated 120 people camp nightly at the park and occupants will be told about other housing options. They said increasingly dangerous conditions such as narcotics trafficking and usage combined with prolonged damage to the park’s irrigation and vegetation created safety concerns and were the leading factors in the decision to close the park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A preacher known for his close friendship with Mayor Eric Adams was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewelry Sunday by armed bandits who crashed his Brooklyn church service, just as he was sermonizing about keeping faith in the face of grave adversity, police said. Bishop Lamor Miller-Whitehead, who embraces his flashy lifestyle and can often be seen driving around the Big Apple in a Rolls Royce, was delivering a sermon at his Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries when police said three robbers walked in. They showed guns and demanded property from Miller-Whitehead and his wife, Asia K. DosReis-Whitehead, police said. The service was also being livestreamed online. In the video, which appears to have been removed from the church’s social media channels, Miller-Whitehead is heard asking his flock, “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” moments before the robbers entered the church. He’s then seen dropping to his hands and knees and repeatedly saying, “all right, all right,” before a man holding a gun and wearing a black sweatshirt enters the frame. The man, who was also wearing a black mask, is then seen approaching Miller-Whitehead, who was hiding behind a gold-colored lectern, and stuffing the bishop’s jewelry into his pockets. Another man, dressed in similar garb, is then seen heading toward Miller-Whitehead, lingering near him for a few minutes and then running off. Miller-Whitehead said in a video posted to Instagram that the robbers ripped his collar off to grab his chain and held a gun to his infant daughter’s face while stealing his wife’s jewelry. Police said the robbers fled in a white Mercedes that was last seen on Avenue D near the church, in Brooklyn’s Canarsie neighborhood. Neither Miller-Whitehead, 44, nor DosReis-Whitehead, 38, were physically injured, police said. They daughter was also unharmed.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A construction worker at Charlotte Douglas International Airport was electrocuted, according to a California-based company for whom he worked. The Charlotte Observer reported Rosendin Electric, a company based in San Jose, California, filed a report Monday morning confirming Sunday’s death at the airport. John Mallow, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said the death was caused by electrocution. The worker’s identity has not been released and the labor department is investigating the incident, Mallow said. It’s not immediately known what project the worker was involved with when he died, or what time it happened. The airport began several construction projects in 2015. The west side of a $608 million terminal lobby expansion recently opened to passengers, but some parts of the lobby, such as ticketing booths and additional lighting, are still being installed. There also are other ongoing projects across the airport complex.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer said the U.S. Environment Protection Agency awarded $280,000 to the state Department of Environmental Quality to implement a program to provide drinking water assistance to underserved, small and disadvantaged communities in the Tri-County Water District.\n\nOhio\n\nMilford Township: A medical helicopter responding to the scene of a fatal accident crashed early Tuesday when it hit power lines, but no one on board the aircraft was seriously injured, authorities said. Three crew members were in the CareFlight helicopter on the way to an accident involving two pickup trucks that occurred about 4:15 a.m. in Milford Township, according to the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. The aircraft was approaching the scene when it crashed into the power lines and went down. According to a statement issued by CareFlight, no patients were in the aircraft, which was being operated by Air Methods, and the crew members were able to safely exit the helicopter. The cause of the crash will be investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Butler County Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer told WXIX-TV that one crew member suffered “an unknown injury” and was taken to a hospital. The other two crew members were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Authorities said one person was killed in the vehicle accident and three other people were injured. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A couple has been charged in the death of a woman whose body was found last year wrapped in plastic in the basement of a home. Margarita Sandoval, 19, had been missing for three years when police found her body in May 2021 in a box hidden underneath some stairs in a home in Norman. After a 14-month investigation, Normal police charged Sandoval’s brother, 35-year-old Octavio Sanchez, and her sister-in-law, 27-year-old Desiree Sanchez, each with murder and unlawful removal of a dead body. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Sandoval’s death a homicide. Investigators said Sandoval had moved in with the couple in their Norman home in January 2018. Several months later, other family members began looking for Sandoval after not hearing from her. Police said Sandoval, who had limited cognitive abilities, had called authorities to report that the couple had been abusive to her. Police alleged the Sanchez couple had continued to collect Sandoval’s disability payments up until her body was discovered.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Temperatures soared to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in Oregon’s largest city on Tuesday, which was expected to be the hottest day of a scorching spell that will be unusually long for this part of the U.S. It was also a new daily record for the city for July 26, besting the previous high set in 2020. Oregon health officials said there has been an uptick in the number of people reporting heat-related illness in emergency departments, and the number of those calling emergency services numbers for similar symptoms. “Heat-related illness daily visits are above expected levels statewide,” said Jonathan Modie, lead communications officer at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division. He said there were 32 such visits to emergency departments on Monday compared to three to five per day before the heat wave began. Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency across much of the state, warning the extreme temperatures might cause utility outages and transportation disruptions. Portland officials opened cooling centers in public buildings and installed misting stations in parks. TriMet, which operates public transportation in the Portland metropolitan area, will allow passengers who cannot afford fares to ride for free when heading to cooling centers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBaden: Punk’s Ice Cream Shoppe has been forced to temporarily close after a car crashed into the building Sunday night. Owner Mariellen Ketterer said the incident occurred about 7 p.m. when a car struck the building’s left side along State Avenue in Baden. The shop was open for business at the time but was forced to close immediately, and Ketterer announced on Facebook it would remain closed until further notice. It is unknown why the car crashed into the building or if the driver or anyone else was injured during the accident. Officers from the Baden Police Department were unavailable to comment on Monday afternoon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The ACLU of Rhode Island said it is concerned a system recording audio and video in the City Clerk’s office might be illegally capturing conversations between visitors in the room. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown wrote to Mayor Roberto L. DaSilva earlier this month, after receiving a complaint from someone visiting City Hall who saw a sign indicating that video and audio surveillance was taking place. In his letter, Brown asked DaSilva for more information about the system and asked that he “take immediate steps to address the legitimate privacy concerns that this surveillance technology raises.” DaSilva, in a three-page response to Brown, wrote a video system has been in place since 2014, but that audio in the clerk’s office was added several weeks ago after “a few customer complaints related to their interactions with city employees.” “Please be assured that the City believes that its use and placement of cameras and audio recordings is fully compliant and consistent with ‘reasonable expectations of privacy’ and various statutory requirements,” DaSilva said in his letter to Brown.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina can continue enforcing its six-week abortion ban after a judge denied a request to temporarily block it amid a legal fight that is now headed to the state Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and other plaintiffs had asked the judge for an injunction while their lawsuit challenging the ban moves through the courts. The lawsuit argued the law violates the state constitution’s rights to privacy and equal protection. South Carolina Deputy Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick on Tuesday argued voters did not intend to cover abortion rights when they approved the state’s right to privacy in 1971.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:An animal rights organization filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking for an investigation into a Sanford Research scientist. The complaint from Stop Animal Exploitation Now was filed by the group after it obtained a document showing that privileges to perform experiments on animals by Shanta Messerli had been permanently revoked. A letter from Sanford Research to the USDA’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare indicated Messerli’s privileges were revoked in January 2021. After an appeal to the Sanford Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, her privileges were restored to perform two specific experiments under direct supervision. But the letter, signed by David Pearce, the president of innovation and research for Sanford’s World Clinic, said Messerli received a subsequent report of noncompliance while conducting an experiment with funding from the Department of Defense. The USDA has the authority to regulate animal research laboratories. The self-reported letter from Sanford Research to USDA was dated May 2. A Sanford spokesperson did not immediately respond for comment. The USDA did not immediately respond.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a new commander for the second time in about a month. Col. Brian D. Sawser assumed command of the expansive district at a ceremony Friday in Memphis, the Corps said in a news release. Lt. Col. Robert W. Green had been named commander in mid-June, and the Corps had said Green would be handing over command to Sawser this month. Sawser now leads a district that covers 25,000 square miles in parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. He is responsible for flood damage reduction, navigation, environmental stewardship, emergency operations and other civil works along 610 miles of the Mississippi River and the White River. The district manages levees, tributaries, harbors and navigation channels connected to the river.\n\nTexas\n\nBalch Springs: A grass fire apparently sparked on the shoulder of a freeway swept about 300 yards across tinder-dry open field to a suburban Dallas subdivision Monday, burning through wooden fences and torching a row of at least eight homes on the subdivision’s edge. The blaze was the latest in drought-stricken north Texas, which has been vulnerable to wildfires for at least two weeks. It was initially unknown what sparked the fire just off Interstate 20 in Balch Springs about 4 p.m. Monday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Aerial video showed the fire spread up and down the street as firefighters and homeowners working in 103 degree heat tried to prevent the fire from spreading to more of the bricked frame homes. One end of the fire spread to a home where a panicked dog ran back and forth before running through a pet door at a neighboring home. The dog’s fate was not immediately known. Fire crews from Dallas and other nearby suburbs have gone to the scene to assist Balch Springs crews.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 6,870 new cases. That’s down 11.8% from the previous week’s total of 7,789. Utah ranked 34th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Cases fell in seven counties, with the largest declines in Salt Lake County, with 2,765 cases from 3,162 a week earlier; in Utah County, with 1,156 cases from 1,284; and in Tooele County, with 167 cases from 226.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Federal prosecutors said a man charged with killing his mother at sea in 2016 in a plot to inherit millions should remain behind bars pending trial because he poses a flight risk and danger to others. The prosecutors filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Burlington on Friday, opposing a request by Nathan Carman to be released. Carman, 28, who lives in Vernon, was charged in May with killing his mother, Linda, of Middletown during a fishing trip in 2016 off the coast of New England in which his boat sank. He was found floating in a raft and rescued eight days after departing from a Rhode Island marina. He pleaded not guilty in May in his mother’s death. Prosecutors also have accused Carman of killing his grandfather, John Chakalos, who they said was shot in his home in Windsor in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather’s estate. Carman has not been charged in that case. Earlier this month, Carman’s attorneys filed a motion seeking his release, saying the evidence against him is “tenuous at best” and he does not pose a flight risk or danger. The attorneys said Carman is willing to surrender his passport, submit to electronic monitoring and turn over all the money he has – $10,000 – to a third party or post some of that money as bail.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state police has temporarily reduced the operating hours for its Med-Flight helicopter service in central and southwest Virginia because of a shortage of pilots. The state police said until more pilots can be hired and trained, the service has been reduced from 24-hour coverage to 16 hours a day, from 8 a.m. through midnight, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The changes went into effect on Sunday. In the meantime, private, for-hire air ambulance services such as those offered by VCU Health Systems and HCA Hospitals will fill the gap in the Richmond area. Med-Flight is free, but the private services bill patients for the transport. In most cases, the fee is covered by a patient’s health care insurance.\n\nWashington\n\nRoyal City: A Moses Lake woman drowned Sunday trying to rescue a dog in a canal, according to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies and medics responded at about 12:45 p.m. to a report of a woman who fell into a canal off Dodson Road Southwest, near Road 12 Southwest, about 3 miles east of Royal City, the Longview Daily News reported. Witnesses told deputies the 46-year-old woman, later identified as Brigetta Delgado, was trying to rescue a dog when she fell into the canal. She went under and did not resurface, becoming trapped by the turbulence in a plunge pool. Her body was recovered once the water released its grip. Delgado’s body was transported to the coroner’s office for an autopsy and her family was notified.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is now able to process some services that have been affected by a system mainframe outage. The agency is using a workaround to process commercial driver’s licenses, driver’s licenses, instruction permits and driver’s license reinstatement transactions, according to a news release Tuesday from the Department of Transportation. The division is continuing to work with the Office of Technology to restore all services, the release said. Customers should visit the DMV website for up-to-date alerts before they visit a regional office or try the online portal, the Department of Transportation said. The outage was first reported last Wednesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Former President Donald Trump plans to visit Wisconsin to campaign for his endorsed candidate for governor, Tim Michels – an announcement made just two days after Michels said he wouldn’t prioritize a key piece of Trumps’ agenda: to decertify the 2020 presidential election results. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Waukesha County Fairgrounds at 7 p.m. Aug. 5, the Friday before the Aug. 9 primary election. Gates are expected to open at 2 p.m., with first speakers to deliver remarks at 4, followed by Trump at 7. Michels faces former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Tim Ramthun in the Republican primary for governor and has surged in recent polling to the top of the field as he spends millions of his own money to blanket television airwaves since entering the race in April. The primary winner will go on to run against Democratic incumbent Gov. Tony Evers in the general election.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A lawsuit filed Monday by a Casper women’s health clinic and others seeks to block Wyoming’s new abortion ban just before it’s scheduled to take effect. The lawsuit claimed the new law violates the state constitution with restrictions that will discourage potentially life-saving pregnancy health care in Wyoming, forcing pregnant women to go to other states for necessary procedures. As with all Wyoming laws challenged in court, Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill will defend the new law set to go into effect Wednesday, Michael Pearlman, spokesman for Gov. Mark Gordon, said by email. Gordon, a Republican, signed the ban on nearly all abortion in Wyoming in March. The ban was to take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which happened June 24. After a more than three-week review, Hill last week gave the go-ahead for Gordon to certify the law to take effect Wednesday. The law will outlaw abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. Wyoming until now has allowed abortions up to the point of viability outside the mother, or about 23 weeks into pregnancy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/24/indigenous-food-boycott-anniversary-herring-disaster-news-around-states/49431999/", "title": "Indigenous food, boycott anniversary: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The city is planning a week of events to commemorate the 66th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In 1955, a dedicated group of people began standing firm against racist segregation in a boycott that spanned 382 days. Activities and events starting Dec. 1 will take place across the city that are designed to honor those who dedicated and risked their lives. This event is being led by Mayor Steven L. Reed, who recently stood with civil rights attorney Fred Gray to expunge the arrest record for Claudette Colvin. While the bus boycott was officially sparked by the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, Colvin was arrested months earlier for the same thing. A unity breakfast will be held Dec. 1 at St. Paul AME Church, and the Rosa Parks Museum will offer free admission all day on the anniversary of her arrest. Free tours of the apartment where she lived from 1951 to 1957 will also be available through the Montgomery Housing Authority. Items inside the home have been preserved or recreated to showcase where many important meetings were held during the civil rights movement. For a full list of activities and events throughout the day next Wednesday and beyond, see mgmbusboycott.com.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man charged with threatening the lives of the state’s two U.S. senators pleaded not guilty Monday, and a judge decided he will remain in custody. Jason Weiner, an attorney for Jay Allen Johnson, entered the plea on his client’s behalf during Johnson’s arraignment in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks. Johnson, from the small community of Delta Junction, was indicted last week on six criminal counts – including threatening to murder a U.S. official, being a felon in possession of firearms, threatening to destroy property by fire and threatening interstate communications. The government is also seeking to confiscate two pistols, three revolvers, a rifle and a shotgun found on Johnson’s rural Alaska property because he is a felon who is not legally allowed to possess firearms. If convicted, Johnson could face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines, assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Tansey said. Johnson, at an earlier hearing, said he is “a senior citizen, and I am highly disabled, and I will not be carrying out any of these threats.” Johnson’s wife testified during a detention hearing in October that her husband was was in pain after recent surgeries and “gets very angry listening to politics on the news.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Volunteers gave out hundreds of free Thanksgiving turkeys Monday as the holidays approach and charities work to help people get what they need to celebrate. The event at the American Legion’s Post No. 65 in south Phoenix helped out about 1,000 families. The 18th Annual Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway was organized by the Sons of the American Legion and the nonprofit HeroZona Foundation. Gov. Doug Ducey Ducey stopped by to help and said in a statement that he was grateful to the volunteers and community groups that came together to help needy families. “It took teamwork to persevere through all the challenges of COVID-19, and events like the Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway show us all that Arizona will have that same sense of camaraderie for decades to come,” Ducey said. The governor’s office said about 50 volunteers joined AP Powell, HeroZona’s founding chairman, to hand out the free food. Powell said the group wanted to ensure that “underserved families in South Phoenix have the opportunity to enjoy Thanksgiving with their loved ones – no matter their circumstances.” Charities and nonprofit groups routinely ramp up their efforts around the holidays to provide food and holiday gifts to low-income Arizonans.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A longtime legislator who left the Republican Party earlier this year following the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol says he won’t run for reelection next year in the state Senate. Sen. Jim Hendren announced Monday that he would not seek another term representing northwest Arkansas. Hendren is a former president of the state Senate who has served in the chamber since 2013. Previously, he had served in the state House of Representatives from 1995 until 1999. He is the nephew of Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Hendren left the GOP in February, citing the deadly riot at the Capitol and then-President Donald Trump’s rhetoric. In his announcement Monday, Hendren did not offer specifics on his future plans but said he planned to do more work with his nonprofit, Common Ground Arkansas. “Of course, that drive to serve isn’t gone,” he said in a statement. “I believe Common Ground has real solutions for Arkansas, and I’m dedicated to helping us build a more unified future together.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have again postponed imposing fees on containers left on docks too long, citing progress in moving the cargo from marine terminals. The decision was made after a meeting Monday among the U.S. port envoy, John D. Porcari; industry stakeholders; and officials of the adjacent ports, the Port of Long Beach said in a press release. The “container dwell fee” will now not be considered before Nov. 29. “Since the fee was announced on Oct. 25, the two ports have seen a decline of 33% combined in aging cargo on the docks,” the statement said. “The executive directors of both ports are satisfied with the progress thus far and will reassess fee implementation after another week of monitoring data.” The fee was imposed by the harbor commissions of both ports as a measure to help ease congestion that has left dozens of ships waiting offshore.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The president of a suburban police union has been placed on paid administrative leave by the police department after he sent an email to the group’s 240 members calling diversity provisions in an agreement between the city and the state “sexist and racist.” Officer Doug Wilkinson sent the email Nov. 16 and was placed on leave the following day after multiple officers complained to human resources, Lt. Chris Amsler, an aide to Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, told KCNC-TV. “To match the ‘diversity’ of ‘the community’ we could make sure to hire 10% illegal aliens, 50% weed smokers, 10% crackheads, and a few child molesters and murderers to round it out. You know, so we can make the department look like the ‘community,’ ” Wilkinson wrote in the email. The email was prompted by an agreement announced the same day that set up reforms for the Aurora police and fire departments. The consent decree followed a lengthy state investigation that found a pattern of racist policing and excessive use of force. It calls for updated hiring practices so the police and fire departments better reflect the city’s racial makeup. Wilkinson told KCNC-TV his missive was intended to be “a private email message to the members” and should not have been made public.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is ramping up efforts to get older residents COVID-19 booster shots by bringing special clinics to nursing homes, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The move comes as the state has seen its highest infection rates since early September. While many homes had boosters administered shortly after extra vaccine doses received the federal go-ahead, these latest clinics will help those facilities that haven’t finished getting residents and eligible staff another dose. “What we’re talking about now is some of the stragglers. As we’ve seen in the past, unfortunately some homes take a little longer to get organized. And so Dr. Juthani and her team are pushing those homes hard to get those clinics done and making sure that everyone in those homes who is eligible (gets a booster shot),” said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer, referring to Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new coronavirus cases in Connecticut has risen by 397, an increase of about 117%, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins. Juthani said the state is on target to have had a booster clinic for residents and staff at 70% of long-term care facilities, including assisted living locations, by Thanksgiving. She said the rest will be finished by Dec. 15.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: At a rally Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton called on lawmakers to open police up to public scrutiny via the controversial Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights and lambasted the state for its handling of officer-involved shootings. “It seemed to me ironic, if not insulting, as I was coming in that you have the nerve to name a street after Martin Luther King while the people of Dr. King are being abused by police, and you will not hold them accountable,” Sharpton said outside Legislative Hall. He spoke alongside police reform activists Lakeisha Nix, sister of Lymond Moses, shot and killed by New Castle County police earlier this year; Keandra McDole, sister of Jeremy McDole, a Black man in a wheelchair who was shot and killed by Wilmington police in 2015; and Blaine Hackett, a pastor at St. John African Methodist Church Inc. Sharpton and the local activists criticized Delaware for upholding the decades-old Bill of Rights law that lets police decide how to discipline bad-acting officers and limits how much the public can know about any punishment. The rally, hosted by quasi-grassroots advocacy company Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware, was held in favor of legislation to amend the Officers’ Bill of Rights by opening up internal affairs records to the public and striking out certain provisions about how officers may be investigated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The regional train system serving the capital region will remain on drastically reduced service levels through at least the end of this year, as authorities grapple with a safety problem that has forced the majority of the trains out of service. Paul J. Wiedefeld, general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, announced Monday that there were no set timelines for the return of the 7000-series train cars to service. The trains are the newest in service, and the 748 cars compose about 60% of the fleet. The Metro authority’s safety commission abruptly ordered the withdrawal of the entire 7000-series line of trains in mid-October after a derailing revealed chronic problems with the wheels and axles. “We are intentionally not setting deadlines so that safety and good data drive our decisions, but we are mindful that customers want the best service we can provide as soon as we can deliver it, and we are committed to building back up in phases,” Wiedefeld said in a statement Monday. The original plans to bring older 6000-series trains out of retirement to help fill in the service gaps have been delayed by the global supply chain crisis, which has prevented the arrival of necessary parts.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The families of most of those killed and wounded in a 2018 high school massacre have reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the federal government over the FBI’s failure to stop the gunman even though it had received information he intended to attack. Attorneys for 16 of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and some of those wounded said Monday that they have reached a monetary settlement with the government over the FBI’s failure to investigate a tip it received about a month before the massacre. The 17th family chose not to sue. The attorneys said the settlement’s details are confidential, but a person familiar with the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the government will pay the families $127.5 million overall. “It has been an honor to represent the Parkland families who, through their immeasurable grief, have devoted themselves to making the world a safer place,” their lead attorney, Kristina Infante, said in a statement. Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, died in the shooting, commended the FBI for accepting responsibility for its inaction, comparing it to the Broward County school district and sheriff’s office, the school security staff and the psychologists who treated the shooter. He believes they all failed to stop the shooter and have ducked responsibility. “The FBI has made changes to make sure this never happens again,” Pollack said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s public university system won’t rename any of the 75 buildings or colleges an internal committee had recommended for changes mostly because of their association with slavery, segregation or mistreatment of American Indians, officials voted Monday. The system’s regents voted not to make any name changes, more than a year after they established a committee to study that issue. “History can teach us important lessons, lessons that if understood and applied make Georgia and its people stronger,” the regents said in a statement unanimously adopted by the board at a specially called meeting. The regents added that while the board would not pursue name changes involving the buildings and colleges as recommended by the advisory group’s report, it acknowledged there were many viewpoints on the matter. “Going forward, the board is committed to naming actions that reflect the strength and energy of Georgia’s diversity,” the statement said. Georgia passed a law in 2019 prohibiting state and local agencies from renaming any buildings named after a “historical entity” or removing any historical monument. Several regents released statements after the vote, but none directly explained why they supported making no changes. Many were appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who supported the 2019 law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A male Hawaiian monk seal has died at a Big Island marine mammal hospital after a five-week battle with toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease spread by cat feces, officials said Monday. Toxoplasmosis is the biggest disease threat facing the Hawaiian monk seal, a critically endangered species numbering just 1,300 animals. The seal that died last week was known as RW22, the Marine Mammal Center said in a news release. The center called on cat owners to keep their feline pets indoors and dispose of litter in the trash to protect the species. Feral cat feces is also a concern. Stray cats have no predators in Hawaii, and their numbers have ballooned. Marketing research commissioned by the Hawaiian Humane Society in 2015 estimated Oahu alone had 300,000 feral cats. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received a report early last month that RW22 had a fishing line in his mouth off Oahu. An X-ray revealed the seal had swallowed some fishing gear. He also showed signs of partial facial nerve paralysis and a corneal ulcer to his left eye, a suspected symptom of toxoplasmosis. The Coast Guard flew RW22 to the seal hospital in Kailua-Kona, where veterinarians treated the seal in hopes of slowing the rate of infection. He regained some stamina and movement but continued to deteriorate.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s top health official has deactivated crisis guidelines for rationing care at most of the state’s hospitals. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen issued the decision Monday after health officials said the number of COVID-19 patients remains high but no longer exceeds health care resources in most areas. Crisis standards remain in effect for northern Idaho. During a news conference, Jeppesen and other health care officials warned of possible future outbreaks. “We are not sharing a ‘mission accomplished’ message,” said James Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke’s Health System. “We don’t believe this will be our last surge of COVID. We hope it’s the worst one.” Crisis standards of care give legal and ethical guidelines to health care providers when they have too many patients and not enough resources to care for them all. They spell out exactly how health care should be rationed to save the most lives possible during a disaster. Idaho activated the crisis standards for northern Idaho on Sept. 7 and statewide Sept. 16. Officials didn’t have a timeline for when crisis standards might be lifted in the northern Idaho district, which covers five counties and includes Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene. Health officials said it will take time to catch up on routine surgeries that have been put off.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Former President Barack Obama’s foundation said Monday that it has received a $100 million donation from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the largest individual contribution it has received to date. The Obama foundation said in a statement that the gift from Bezos is intended “to help expand the scope of programming that reaches emerging leaders” in the United States and around the world. The donation, it said, was also given in honor of John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights icon who died last year. As part of the gift, the foundation said Bezos has asked for the plaza at the Obama Presidential Center, under construction in Chicago’s South Side, to be named after Lewis. Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Obama who serves as the foundation’s CEO, said in a statement that the foundation was “thrilled” by that idea. Construction on Obama’s legacy project is expected to cost about $830 million and be completed by 2025. In the meantime, the foundation said it’s giving donors the opportunity to “honor and elevate the names of those who have fought for a more just and equitable world” by naming public spaces in the center. “Freedom fighters deserve a special place in the pantheon of heroes, and I can’t think of a more fitting person to honor with this gift than John Lewis, a great American leader and a man of extraordinary decency and courage,” Bezos said in the statement released by the foundation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Biking advocates reeling from the deaths of seven people this year in collisions between vehicles and cyclists are calling for the city to do more to try to prevent such crashes. About two dozen cyclists held a moment of silence for seven minutes – one for each crash victim – at a downtown plaza Sunday evening to mark World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The candlelight vigil was organized by Bike Indianapolis, a nonprofit group that says seven cyclists, by its count, have received a fatal blow from a vehicle in the capital city since mid-July. “This was too many deaths,” said Sylva Zhang, Bike Indianapolis’ marketing director. In each of the previous six years, the city recorded between one and five fatal crashes with cyclists, according to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization’s crash dashboard. Biking advocates want the city to establish a crash response team of city-county employees and independent citizens to examine crash sites involving cyclists and pedestrians and recommend preventive infrastructure and policy improvements. They also want the city to respond to those recommendations with plans and to create a database of crash data and reports immediately after they are submitted.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A law that prohibits Medicaid coverage for sex reassignment surgeries for transgender Iowans violates state law and the state constitution, a judge ruled in a decision made public Monday. Judge William Kelly ordered the Iowa Department of Human Services to provide coverage for sex reassignment surgeries when ordered to treat gender dysphoria, a psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. It often begins in childhood, and some people may not experience it until after puberty or much later, according to the American Psychiatric Association. About 12 states exclude the surgeries in Medicaid coverage; 18 specifically include gender-affirming care; and others do not address it. The ruling is a victory for Aiden Vasquez and Mika Covington, two residents represented by the ACLU of Iowa. Kelly said state and federal courts in the past 16 years have found that gender identity discrimination is a form of sex discrimination, which is prohibited under civil rights laws. He also found the law violated the equal protection clause of the state constitution. It is not challenged in the record that surgical treatment for gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition, and the surgery is recommended for Vasquez and Covington by medical professionals as necessary and effective, the judge said.\n\nKansas\n\nMinneapolis: Dale “Duster” Hoffman didn’t want a sorrowful funeral, so instead he got a parade. KWCH-TV reports residents of the small town of Minneapolis, Kansas, turned out Sunday for a parade honoring Hoffman, who died this month at age 71. Hoffman had said he wanted his friends and family to remember him with a fun and joyful gathering. More than 100 cars took part in driving down Main Street as part of the parade. One relative said it was believed to be one of the largest parades ever in Minneapolis, a town of about 2,000 residents about 180 miles west of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A judge has ruled against a police union in a lawsuit that sought to stop a ban on no-knock warrants in the city. A Fayette County judge agreed Friday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the local police union, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The Fraternal Order of Police Bluegrass Lodge No. 4 filed suit in July against the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government over the no-knock warrant ban it enacted following months of debate after Breonna Taylor was killed by police in Louisville during a raid at her apartment. The union said in the lawsuit that banning the warrants is unsafe and that the organization has the right to bargain on behalf of Lexington officers over changes that affect officers’ “health and safety.” Circuit Judge Kimberly Bunnell said elected officials had the right to enact public policies without bargaining. The FOP may appeal the decision, local representative said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Nearly 15 months after Hurricane Laura struck, the state is kicking off $11.3 million in housing repair and rebuilding programs for the southwestern city of Lake Charles while it waits for hundreds of millions in promised federal aid to arrive. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter, a Republican, announced the plans at a joint press conference Monday. The effort will be financed with federal housing and disaster recovery funds available to the state and city through various programs. The dollars largely will pay for home rehabilitation work for low- to moderate-income homeowners, with grants capped at $50,000 per household. A $1 million share of the money will help landlords rebuild housing if they are willing to rent to low- to moderate-income tenants. “The housing situation in Lake Charles is absolutely dire,” Hunter said. “This is going to help.” The city of Lake Charles will administer the program. Hunter didn’t immediately provide information on how people can apply, saying the city is still working out logistics. Edwards and Hunter acknowledged the money is nowhere near the amount needed to address the gaps in insurance coverage and blight of abandoned houses destroyed by Laura in Lake Charles alone, plus the needs of the southwestern region.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The herring fishing industry in the Northeast qualifies for federal assistance because its 2019 season has been declared a disaster. The federal government has the ability to declare a “fishery disaster” when adverse circumstances in a fishery cause economic hardship. A recent scientific assessment of the herring population found the species population has fallen, and tighter fishing quotas have made herring fishing more difficult. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced the disaster declaration Monday. Members of the herring fishing industry will be eligible for disaster assistance, and some fishery-related businesses might also qualify for federal loans, the commerce department said. The commerce department said the allocation of money will be determined soon. Herring are economically important because they’re widely used as lobster bait, as well as for food. The species is also critical to the health of the ocean because of its role in the food chain. Herring fishermen caught more than 200 million pounds of herring as recently as 2014, but the 2019 catch was less than 25 million. The fishery is based mostly in Maine and Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nSharpsburg: The vice mayor is facing federal firearms charges, authorities said. An indictment unsealed last week charges Jacob Martz, 41, with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun in connection with 16 firearms and multiple machine-gun conversion devices found at his home, according to a U.S. Attorney’s Office news release. The indictment alleges Martz knew he was prohibited from possessing firearms due to previous felony firearms convictions, but he had 16 guns and about 5,200 rounds of ammunition on Oct. 6. It also alleges he possessed devices used to convert AR-15-style rifles into machine guns, officials said. Martz, vice mayor of Sharpsburg, a small western Maryland town, turned himself in Thursday and pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, defense attorney David W. Fischer said. “We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations,” Fischer said. U.S. Attorney’s Office spokeswoman Marcia Murphy said information about the investigation and what led to the charges wouldn’t be made public. Martz was released to his residence, she said. Martz faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each charge, although sentences are typically less than the maximum, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Mayor Michelle Wu signed an ordinance Monday designed to divest the city from fossil fuels. The ordinance will prohibit the use of public funds from being invested in the stocks, securities or other obligations of any company that derives more than 15% of its revenue from fossil fuels. The ordinance also extends to companies deriving more than 15% of revenue from tobacco products or private prison industries. Wu, a former city councilor sworn in as mayor last week, said the move is the culmination of a years­long push to distance Boston from the fossil fuels that are helping drive the climate change that is threatening the coastal city. “This is deeply personal for many of us and urgent,” Wu said during a signing ceremony at Boston City Hall. “My older son, Blaise, was born in the first year that I served in this building and the first year that we started to hear it was the hottest year ever on record. Since then, his six years alive on this planet have each been our hottest on record. ... We’re moving quickly to make sure that Boston will set the tone for what is possible for that brightest greenest future for all of our kids.” The ordinance will pull $65 million immediately out of the fossil fuel industry, said Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards, a supporter of the ordinance, unanimously approved by the City Council last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: At least one person died, and a 3-year-old child remained missing Tuesday, after an overnight explosion and fire destroyed three homes, damaged several others and sent debris falling onto a neighborhood, authorities said. Flint Fire Chief Raymond Barton said Tuesday that two people were rushed from the scene Monday night to area hospitals, where one of them – a 70-year-old man – was pronounced dead. The father of the missing child was in critical condition, Barton said. Another person reported minor injuries following the explosion, which destroyed three homes in the neighborhood on Flint’s west side, WJRT-TV reports. Barton said a Michigan State Police cadaver dog and fire crews with specialized equipment were searching for the 3-year-old. “This is a tragic time for our community,” Mayor Sheldon Neeley said during a Tuesday morning news conference. Three houses were fully engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived at the scene after 9:30 p.m. Monday. Officials said about 20 houses sustained damage, including broken windows from debris thrown across an entire block by the explosion, which was felt miles away. The cause of the explosion, which left the neighborhood littered with splintered wood and other debris, was under investigation, Neeley said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The USDA Office of Tribal Relations announced this week that it will partner with several Native American-led organizations on projects to raise awareness of Indigenous perspectives about food and agriculture. “The United States government hasn’t always incorporated Indigenous views and values into our work. And that’s particularly true within the food and agricultural space,” said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the Office of Tribal Relations and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe. “We’re taking this moment to rethink how the United States Department of Agriculture interacts with and thinks about Indigenous foods and Indigenous farming and ranching techniques.” Two regional seed processing centers will be created through the Minnesota-based Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. USDA will help fund equipment for the facilities, one in Minnesota and one in the southwestern U.S. “Some of this equipment is quite pricey and difficult for the average producer or seed saver to acquire on their own,” Thompson said. “So these will become regional hubs that will be available to Native producers to share and use in a cooperative fashion, in order to process their seeds and save them.” Minneapolis-based North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems will develop recipes using traditional Indigenous foods and foods provided to tribal communities through the federal Emergency Food Assistance Program, said co-founder and executive director Dana Thompson.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A post office now bears the name of an Air Force colonel who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for nearly a decade. During his captivity, Carlyle “Smitty” Harris wrote a letter to his wife, Louise, that ended up at the same post office, the Daily Journal reports. It was renamed for him at a ceremony Friday. “This post office has been in our lives for about 57 years,” Harris said. He still had the letter he sent his wife and pulled it from his coat pocket as he spoke. The letter was delivered to the post office in 1965. Harris was shot down over North Vietnam on April 4 of that year and spent the next eight years as a prisoner of war. A bill to rename the post office was introduced in Congress by U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly and signed into law by President Joe Biden in August.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A former police officer convicted of beating a Black undercover detective during a 2017 racial injustice protest has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison – far more lenient than prosecutors and the victim had sought. Dustin Boone was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court after being convicted in June of a federal civil rights violation related to the attack on Luther Hall. Boone, 37, was one of five white officers charged in the beating. Boone’s sentence was less even than his own lawyers requested. While prosecutors sought a 10-year sentence, defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber to sentence Boone to 26 months. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the sentence appeared to stun Hall, his relatives and his supporters, who walked out of the courtroom before Webber finished pronouncing the sentence. They declined comment after the hearing, as did prosecutors. Hall, in a statement to Webber before the sentence was announced, said he thought Webber’s sentencing of two other officers charged in the case was too lenient, “leniency that’s not shown to African American defendants.” Boone’s attorneys had argued that he did not participate in the initial Sept. 17, 2017, beating and held Hall down only because other officers were “acting as though” they were making an arrest.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: An investigation into a complaint that public officials tried to intimidate hospital employees into treating a COVID-19 patient with unapproved medications uncovered a voicemail left by a former state senator in which she said she didn’t think “senators would be too happy to hear about” the hospital’s care of the patient. Jennifer Fielder, now a member of the Public Service Commission, told the Legislature’s special counsel she left the voicemail with St. Peter’s Health on Oct. 11 as a personal matter on behalf of the patient, whom she described as a friend. Senate Minority Leader Jill Cohenour argued Tuesday that if Fielder were leaving a personal message, she wouldn’t have identified herself as a senator in the call. Attorney General Austin Knudsen has acknowledged he intervened in the case and later said Chief Deputy Attorney General Kristen Hansen brought the issue to him, but he denied intimidating anyone. In Fielder’s voicemail, she identified herself as a state senator, and later a former state senator, and said the patient was a Senate staffer. The patient previously served as a temporary state Senate staffer and was not working for the Legislature at the time of her hospitalization, according to the special counsel Abra Belke’s report, released Monday night. The patient, who was admitted to the hospital Oct. 9, died Oct. 26. She was 82.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts railed Monday against the chancellor of the University of Nebraska’s flagship campus, saying he was misled about a plan designed to address racial disparities on campus, even as the university system’s president tried to deescalate the situation. Ricketts said he has “lost all faith” in University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Ronnie Green, who has endorsed the plan as a way to make the campus more diverse and inclusive. Ricketts said Green told him the plan was an effort to increase the number of minority faculty, staff and students on campus, which Ricketts said was “a good thing.” But he said Green didn’t tell him about other parts of the initiative, including a “call to action” statement that says structural racism in society is the cause of disparities between races and isn’t limited to individual beliefs or actions. The statement says the plan is intended to transform the university into a place where every person matters and gets “equitable outcomes.” The Republican governor has blasted the idea as “ideological indoctrination” that will encourage people to see each other through the lens of race instead of as individuals with unique strengths. Just hours before Ricketts spoke, University of Nebraska President Ted Carter released an open letter in support of the plan. “These are uncomfortable conversations, with passionate opinions on many sides,” he said. “Not every Nebraskan, not every member of the university community, will agree with every element of the plan.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two Las Vegas-area elected officials are using the same word, “scary,” to describe weekend demonstrations outside their homes involving people expressing opposition to government COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates. “The scary thing – it was dark, and I couldn’t really see what was going on out there,” Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Segerblom, a Democrat, said Monday that about 20 protesters stayed about two hours outside his home Sunday, holding flags, honking and speaking into bullhorns. He said one repeated chant was: “No mask, no vax.” Outside Clark County School District Board President Linda Cavazos’ home in Henderson, as many as 40 demonstrators showed up about 4:30 p.m. and stayed for about two hours, Clark County School District Police Lt. Bryan Zink said. In photos provided by Cavazos, people can be seen carrying American flags, a yellow “Don’t tread on me” flag and a banner reading, “Let’s go, Brandon” – a term that has become code for a vulgar insult against President Joe Biden. Another man is draped in what appears to be a Confederate flag. Cavazos described the demonstration as “just scary.” “It’s more like bullying,” Cavazos said. “It’s more like intimidation. It’s just not OK.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is getting more than $8.3 million to support marketing, workforce and other projects to boost business and travel. The funding was allocated through the American Rescue Plan. The state’s congressional delegation announced the funds last week. “Travel and tourism are core industries that fuel local economies across New Hampshire – these sectors are key to our state’s recovery following the pandemic,” U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement. The grant comes from the Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, which makes investments in economically distressed communities in order to create jobs, promote innovation and accelerate long-term sustainable economic growth.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The state has moved closer to withdrawing from a bi-state commission formed to monitor corruption at the New York region’s ports. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a lawsuit filed by the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor that had sought to block New Jersey’s move. If the state of New York doesn’t step in to file a legal challenge, the commission would effectively be dissolved. The commission was formed in the 1950s to combat entrenched organized crime influences at the ports. But in recent years, New Jersey has contended that organized crime has largely been driven out of the ports and that the commission was impeding job growth by over-regulating businesses there and making hiring more difficult. Under New Jersey’s plan, state police would take over investigating criminal activity at the ports. The New York-New Jersey port system, among the busiest in the country, includes container terminals in Newark, Elizabeth and Bayonne in New Jersey, as well as Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York. The New Jersey terminals handle the bulk of the port’s business. “The Governor is pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to reject the Waterfront Commission’s appeal,” Michael Zhadanovsky, a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy, said in an email Tuesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Major repairs to a northern New Mexico dam will mean irrigation water will have to be stored elsewhere. Repairs on El Vado Dam are slated to start next spring, leaving it unusable for at least a year to deliver water to the Middle Rio Grande Valley, said Page Pegram of the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission. Abiquiu Lake most likely will be the backup, Pegram told the Albuquerque Journal. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation plans to address cracks in El Vado’s steel faceplate and the foundation, as well as the deteriorating spillway. The dam was built in the 1930s, and its current condition isn’t safe for the public, the agency said. El Vado Dam can hold back about 60 billion gallons of water, but the capacity will be reduced significantly while the repairs are being done. Persistent drought also has meant less water in New Mexico reservoirs, and the region could be in store for a dry winter with a La Niña weather pattern. “Water supply conditions for the Middle Rio Grande in 2022 are expected to be significantly diminished,” Pegram said. “We expect stream flows in the basin to remain below average.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is facing calls from faculty to boost its public university system by launching a university endowment – a step dozens of other states have taken. Lawmakers on the state Senate higher education committee held a hearing Monday as part of the ongoing budget process. New York’s economy is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the state is facing demands for increased spending at a time when tax collections are strong. The state’s general fund as of September was $4.5 billion higher than the previous September. It’s time for New York to allocate $150 million in additional aid to state-operated campuses, said Frederick Kowal, president of the United University Professions union, which represents more than 37,000 academic and professional faculty. Kowal told lawmakers that New York flat-funded higher education and increased the state’s reliance on students’ tuition and fees under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “The abandonment of our public higher education system has directly led to drops in enrollment,” Kowal said. And he said an endowment would provide a long-term funding resource to rebuild “depleted” academic departments and hire and promote a more diverse workforce.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper approved a measure Tuesday for a new governing structure for high school sports. The new law allows the State Board of Education to create a formal agreement with the North Carolina High School Athletic Association, the nonprofit body currently governing high school athletics. Under the compromise legislation, the State Board of Education can now reach a memorandum of understanding with the group to administer and enforce the education board’s requirements for high school sports. The deal needs to be reached by March 15 and last an initial four years. “For months, we worked tirelessly to determine the best governing structure that supports our student-athletes and is transparent and accountable,” said a statement from state Sen. Vickie Sawyer, an Iredell County Republican who helped craft the bipartisan bill. “After productive conversations with the NCHSAA, State Board of Education, Governor’s Office, and our Democratic colleagues, we’ve established a clear path forward. I want to thank Gov. Cooper for signing this bill into law.” While state education officials must adopt student participation rules, they can delegate rules on items like school penalties and participation fees to the association, which currently represents more than 400 schools.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Game and Fish Department on Monday unveiled a plan to bring landowners, conservation groups, scientists and others together to restore native grasslands. The agency said North Dakota has lost more than 70% of its native prairie, which is essential for wildlife, pollinators, ranching operations and communities. About 60% of the nearly 5 million wetland acres in the state have been converted or lost. “When we talk about native prairie in the state, we need to acknowledge who the owners and managers of our native prairie are,” said Greg Link, the department’s conservation and communications division chief. “In most cases, we’re talking about ranchers and producers who run livestock on that prairie.” The so-called Meadowlark Initiative is named after the official state bird, known for its unique song. The western meadowlark populations in North Dakota are continuing to decline, wildlife officials said. The program allows producers to plant marginal cropland back to diverse native perennial grasslands for grazing. Funding is available to establish the grass and install grazing infrastructure, such as fencing and water. Producers also are eligible to receive rental payments for the first three years as the land transitions from cropland to grazing land.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: CVS, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two Ohio counties, a federal jury said Tuesday in a verdict that could set the tone for city and county governments across the country that want to hold pharmacies accountable for their roles in the opioid crisis. Lake and Trumbull counties blamed the three chain pharmacies for not stopping the flood of pills that caused hundreds of overdose deaths and cost each of the two counties about $1 billion, their attorney said. How much the pharmacies must pay in damages will be decided in the spring by a federal judge. It was the first time pharmacy companies had completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans over the past two decades. The counties were able to convince the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication into their communities. “The law requires pharmacies to be diligent in dealing drugs. This case should be a wake-up call that failure will not be accepted,” said Mark Lanier, an attorney for the counties. Spokespeople for CVSHealth and Walgreen Co. said the companies disagree with the verdict and will appeal. Two other chains, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle, already had settled lawsuits with the counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Monday signed into law newly drawn maps for the state’s five congressional and 149 state House and Senate districts. The bills, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature during a special session last week, contain the new district boundaries that will be in place for the next 10 years. The new maps had to reapportion the state’s population, which has continued shifting from rural communities to urban and suburban areas. Democrats strongly opposed the newly drawn 5th Congressional District, which has been competitive in recent years, with Democrats winning the seat as recently as 2018 before Republicans won it back last year. The new map moves Democratic portions of Oklahoma City’s core and south side into the heavily Republican 3rd Congressional District that stretches across western and northwestern Oklahoma. Andy Moore, executive director of the group People Not Politicians, which tried unsuccessfully to shift the responsibility of drawing the new maps from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission, said the new maps were a clear example of gerrymandering. “We are disappointed that the Legislature adopted a congressional map that was drawn in secret, divides communities and prioritizes politics over what’s best for Oklahoma voters,” he said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As COVID-19 cases in the state continue to decrease, health officials announced Tuesday that they are immediately lifting statewide mask requirements in crowded outdoor settings. Oregon was the first state in the U.S. to reimplement an outdoor mask mandate for both vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in August as the delta variant of the coronavirus spread. At the time, Oregon was in the midst of its worst surge during the pandemic. Record daily COVID-19 cases were set day after day, and hospitalizations overwhelmed the health system. A majority of people hospitalized were unvaccinated. However, over the past six weeks, health officials say Oregon’s daily COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have steadily declined. Last week, cases decreased by 12% from the previous week. “We took decisive measures. And, as has been the case over the course of this pandemic, Oregonians resoundingly responded,” Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority, said Tuesday. “Together we have managed to turn back the tsunami of new infections that very nearly swamped our health care system.” Oregon has had some of the strictest statewide coronavirus-related restrictions and safety measures during the pandemic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Eight civilian Philadelphia Police Department employees were indicted on charges of collecting Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to which they were not entitled because they remained employed. Seven of the employees are dispatchers, and one is a clerk. A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging them with theft of government funds, wire fraud and mail fraud. The accused took advantage of a system that was designed to aid people left unemployed because of the pandemic, prosecutors said. Each allegedly submitted weekly certifications stating that they were not employed and were ready, willing and able to work each day, prosecutors said. According to the indictment, those statements were false because each was employed by the police department. Prosecutors said the employees received assistance funds for multiple weeks while also collecting a salary from the city. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw on Tuesday said she will suspend them for 30 days with the intent to dismiss them at the end of the 30 days upon completion of arrest procedures.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has been awarded an $81.7 million federal grant for the state health department to build a new public health laboratory. Rhode Island’s congressional delegation announced the new federal Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity grant, saying the current facility, commissioned in 1978, has insufficient laboratory space, inadequate building systems and broken equipment, and the state spends more than $500,000 annually to keep it working efficiently. The state health laboratories work to investigate and mitigate life-threatening diseases, including COVID-19, eastern equine encephalitis, Ebola, H1N1 and Zika. Last year, when commercial testing services weren’t yet widely available, the number of coronavirus samples that could be tested was limited due to insufficient laboratory space, the delegation said. “COVID-19 revealed a serious gap in our health care infrastructure. This new federal funding will help Rhode Island bridge that gap and create a new state-of-the-art lab facility for the 21st century,” U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Jim Langevin and David Cicilline said in a joint statement. The state health laboratories also work with state and municipal agencies to ensure the safety of drinking water and food, monitor water and air pollution, and help public safety and criminal investigations through police officer training, DNA testing and drug identification.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State health and education officials want students to come up with a short song to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines. The winning jingle will get the winner’s school $10,000 toward music programs and be recorded and featured in statewide radio advertisements in 2022. Individual students, classes or groups can all compete in the Sing It to Win It campaign. The deadline is Jan. 31, officials said. Five finalists will be chosen and put up for a vote on both the state Department of Education and state Department of Health and Environmental Control’s social media accounts. A $5,000 second place and $3,000 third place prize will also be awarded to a school.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Marcella Rose LeBeau, an Army nurse who was honored for her service during World War II and leadership in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, has died. She was 102. Family members said she “passed on to journey to the next world” late Sunday in Eagle Butte after experiencing problems with her digestive system and losing her appetite. LeBeau had remained active all of her life and earlier this month traveled to Oklahoma for a ceremony honoring her induction into the National Native American Hall of Fame. Her daughter, Gerri Lebeau, said the matriarch of her family demonstrated fortitude, as well as an ability to seek healing, as she overcame the abuses she faced at an Indian boarding school during her youth. She went on to treat front-line soldiers as an Army nurse in Europe during the Allied invasion of Normandy. After returning home, she became an outspoken advocate for health in the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “She was the foundation of our family,” said her grandson Ryman LeBeau. “She had a lifetime of good things that she had accomplished.” Lebeau was born in 1919 and grew up in Promise, South Dakota, as a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Her mother died when she was 10 years old, and her grandmother gave her the name Wigmunke’ Waste Win’, or Pretty Rainbow Woman. But LeBeau grew up at a time when the government was attempting to eradicate her culture – while her grandmother only spoke the Lakota language, she could be punished for speaking it at the boarding school.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A historically Black medical college is giving students an early Thanksgiving gift – $10,000 in cash. Meharry Medical College President James E.K. Hildreth announced the gift Monday, telling students they would receive it Wednesday. The money comes from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, part of a federal coronavirus aid package. Schools across the country have used their money to wipe out student debts, offer free tuition and give cash grants such as the one at Meharry. In a video message to the Nashville school’s 956 students, Hildreth said they can manage their money however they choose, but he strongly urged them to use it for their education and training. Rising senior Benson Joseph said he is still deciding how to use his gift, but he will definitely set a portion aside to help cover travel expenses when he interviews for residency programs next year and other expenses financial aid does not cover. “It feels like Christmas came a little bit early,” said Joseph, who plans to pursue neurosurgery. “The last two years have been quite a trial for a lot of us.” Hildreth said in the video announcement that he is thankful for those who work at Meharry and those who support the college with their resources. “But mostly, I’m thankful for you students and the future of health care that is entrusted to you,” he said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Students at a suburban high school are planning more demonstrations after four students were arrested last week at a protest against the school’s response to allegations of sexual harassment. Hundreds of students decided to walk out of their classes at Little Elm High School on Friday morning after a sophomore publicly accused a freshman of sexually harassing and abusing her. The sophomore’s friend posted on social media that she had reported the abuse to the school’s administration. The friend alleged the administration then suspended the sophomore for three days for falsely accusing the freshman, according to the post. In a joint statement with Little Elm Mayor Curtis Cornelious, Little Elm Superintendent Daniel Gallagher said the school’s investigation of the alleged abuse did not find sufficient evidence of a crime. He denied allegations the student received disciplinary action for reporting the harassment. Another junior, Kailey Heaton, said things turned violent when police officers attempted to corral the protesting students by linking arms. Heaton said the officers began attempting to push the teens back, but students eventually broke through the line. Videos widely shared on social media show officers forcibly holding a student on the ground while arresting him. Others show two officers pepper-spraying one student and firing their Tasers at him. Cornelious said in a video statement on Facebook that officers were justified in their use of force against the students.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah is investigating complaints related to the removal of several books from high school library shelves after a parent complaint. The Canyons School District appears to have disregarded its own policy for responding to such complaints by pulling nine books off the shelves, including “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison, before completing a full review, the organization said in a statement. The removals came after a parent of younger students in the district emailed about what she called sexually explicit material in several titles that she learned about from social media, KSL.com reports. She told the outlet she had asked for them to be reviewed for content, not necessarily pulled. The Canyons policy states that books should remain in use until a full review of any challenged material is complete. In this case, nine books were removed from shelves in four high schools while a review was still in process. District spokesman Jeff Haney has said the district decided to pull the books off the shelves of the school libraries while district officials review the policy itself, which also says that challenges to library materials cannot come from outside a school community. In a statement to KSL.com, he framed the district’s action as a “review for content.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed into law Tuesday a bill that will allow the state’s municipalities to adopt temporary indoor mask mandates. Scott’s signature came a day after the Legislature held a special session in which the new law that allows a municipality to impose its own mask was introduced and approved. Scott said he called the special session at the request of the Vermont League of Cities and Towns as a compromise after some lawmakers urged him to reimpose a statewide mask mandate. “As you’ve heard me say repeatedly, masking when inside in public spaces is a good idea right now because masks work, but at this point in the pandemic, mandates won’t,” Scott said. “And I think they’ll be divisive and counterproductive.” Within hours of the new law taking effect, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said he would propose requiring facial coverings in indoor public settings except for situations in which all employees and customers in city businesses are verified to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The ordinance will go before the Burlington City Council on Dec. 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A hospital has seen a surge in cases of a coronavirus-related complication in children, officials said. The Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU said 15 kids were hospitalized at the same time last month with a rare inflammatory condition in children linked with the virus, WRIC-TV reports. It was the hospital’s highest peak since the pandemic started, officials said. Previously, it had two or three children hospitalized with the condition at a time. Dr. Tiffany Kimbrough, director of the hospital’s Mother-Infant Unit, said the hospital has seen 50 cases since the pandemic began. The condition can occur two to six weeks after a child recovers from a mild or asymptomatic battle with COVID-19. Kids get symptoms like fever, trouble breathing, abdominal pain and vomiting “and can progress to full shock very quickly,” Kimbrough said. No children with the condition have died on the hospital’s watch, she said. Among the cases the facility has seen, a majority of the children affected are kids of color, she said. Despite the “concerning” numbers last month, Kimbrough said health workers are hopeful that as more children get vaccinated against COVID-19, they will see fewer infections in that age group.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a 2022 budget that cuts police department spending from previous years, drawing criticism from people who say city voters earlier this month endorsed more spending on public safety. In an 8-1 vote Monday, the council approved a $355.5 million budget for the department, saying there are no cuts functionally for the Seattle Police Department. KOMO reports the budget includes funds to hire 125 officers in 2022. But the police department’s budget is smaller compared to years past. In 2021 the budget was $363 million, and in 2020 it was $401.8 million. Outgoing Mayor Jenny Durkan criticized the new spending plan. “Every time council acts, they’re telling officers that are here today if they’re valued or not,” Durkan said. “Mayor-elect Harrell ran on adding more officers, and I’m trying to set him up for success as much as I can.” Bruce Harrell easily won the race for Seattle mayor, running on a platform of increased spending on police services and criticizing opponents who advocated “defunding” the police. The new budget includes funds for 1,357 officers, and SPD reports currently having 1,120 officers on the force, which leaves 237 open jobs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSnowshoe: A ski resort is opening some of its trails to the public on Thanksgiving. Snowshoe Mountain said it will start the ski season for the general public Thursday with a limited number of trails. The resort also will be open Wednesday to passholders and anyone who already purchased lift tickets for that day. The Pocahontas County facility will have 30 acres of available terrain to skiers and snowboarders with three lifts operating, the West Virginia Ski Areas Association said in a news release. Ski operations at Timberline resort could start as early as the weekend, while Canaan Valley and Winterplace resorts are scheduled to begin in the middle of next month, the statement said. Visitors are asked to check with individual resorts for COVID-19 safety requirements. The association again this year is offering a program that will let children in fourth and fifth grades ski or snowboard for free. Under the program, up to three junior lift tickets and one rental will be allowed at participating resorts during the 2021-22 season, the statement said. West Virginia resorts draw more than 800,000 skier visits a year, typically luring visitors from Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio and Florida. The ski and snowboard season traditionally runs through late March, weather permitting.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Cities are looking for ways to care for an increased number of people experiencing homelessness this winter. Joe Volk, executive director of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Homelessness, said communities across the state have been allocating money to increase services for unsheltered people. He said much of the funding has come from federal pandemic recovery aid, often being used to provide hotel rooms and other temporary housing. Volk said there are more people experiencing homelessness this fall than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, including families with children, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “We’ve been through an unimaginable year and a half of social and economic disruption,” Volk said. “Certainly things would probably be a lot worse if the federal government hadn’t stepped in.” But he said that “a certain number of those folks are going to fall through the cracks and become homeless.” The La Crosse City Council has voted to allocate $700,000 to fund a temporary winter shelter from November to March. In Madison, city officials have been working to relocate people living in tents at a local park to a new city-owned encampment. The site has 30 prefabricated shelters with heating and electricity, as well as bathroom facilities and on-site support staff from local nonprofits.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: A student team at the University of Wyoming has been awarded $100,000 for its work on technology to track carbon in soil as part of efforts to help capture and store greenhouse gases, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/18/gator-rebound-paragliding-sea-turtle-protections-news-around-states/119060514/", "title": "Gator rebound, paragliding at 103: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A divided state school board has cemented rules that ban so-called critical race theory teachings from K-12 classrooms and limit how educators can talk about race in the classroom. The decision drew sharp criticism from opponents who said the language could prevent honest conversations and lessons about history and race. The Alabama State Board of Education voted 7-2 on Thursday to put the measure in the state administrative code, news outlets report. It instructs schools to follow a previous resolution that bans “concepts that impute fault, blame, a tendency to oppress others, or the need to feel guilt or anguish to persons solely because of their race or sex.” It also bans theories that promote political ideologies or “one race or sex above another.” The Rev. Rayford Mack of Montgomery called the resolution an “anti-truth” measure, al.com reports. “It is a dangerous step backwards that has emerged from a coordinated national effort to suppress our nation’s history and to deny the experience of Black people and other people of color,” he said. Board members in August first approved the measure in August. Alabama Superintendent Eric Mackey said critical race theory is not currently taught in Alabama schools, but board members wanted to take action that would be preventative.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention, the largest gathering of Indigenous people in the state, will be fully virtual this year, organizers announced Friday. The decision was made after federation leaders consulted with state federal and tribal health officials and reviewed current COVID-19 data trends, according to a statement. The federation decided to go all-virtual out of concern for the safety of the thousands of people from across the state who normally attend in person, the statement said. Organizers cited the continuing high rates of COVID-19, transmission, hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in Anchorage, the statement said. Alaska currently has the highest number of cases in the past seven days per 100,000 population among the 50 states, the state health department said Thursday in its weekly case update. “The incidence of COVID-19 in the Municipality of Anchorage appears to have either plateaued or be increasing. Regardless of the trajectory, intense community transmission is continuing to occur and is causing significant illness, death, and demand on the health care system,” the report says. “Safety is paramount to our decision,” said Sheri Buretta, chair of Alaska Federation of Natives convention committee, who also noted social distancing guidelines would be hard to meet.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has rejected the Republican-controlled state Senate’s contention that it can withhold a raft of communications between its leaders and private contractors they hired to conduct an unprecedented review of the 2020 election results in the state’s most populous county. The ruling released Thursday evening is the latest in a series of losses for the Senate stemming from its efforts to keep secret records showing how the review was conducted. A watchdog group called American Oversight had sued to compel their release and repeatedly won. The Arizona Republic has a separate lawsuit seeking records from the election review. The Senate has already released tens of thousands of records after court rulings in the American Oversight case found they were covered by the state’s public records law. It was trying to shield more than 1,000 other texts and emails. American Oversight said it is fighting for the public’s right to know how the partisan audit was funded and how Cyber Ninjas and other private contractors hired by the Senate conducted the review. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp’s ruling said the Senate’s position that the records were covered by legislative privilege was flat wrong. He said that privilege is intended to protect debate about pending legislation.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State Attorney General Leslie Rutledge raised $190,970 over the past three months in her bid for governor, her campaign said Friday, as she continued trailing former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in fundraising for the state’s top office. Rutledge’s campaign said the latest contributions brought her total fundraising haul to more than $1.6 million since she announced her candidacy last year. Rutledge spent $259,134 during the quarter and reported having more than $1 million cash on hand. Sanders a day earlier reported raising $2.1 million during the quarter and having $7 million in the bank for her bid. The two are running in next year’s Republican primary. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file their quarterly fundraising reports with the state. Rutledge said more than 80% of her contributions are from Arkansans. All but $3.7 million of the $11 million Sanders has raised total has come from out-of-state donors. “I will continue to keep my campaign focused on Arkansas and issues that are important to Arkansans,” Rutledge said in a statement. The two are running to succeed Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. Chris Jones, a Democratic candidate, on Thursday reported raising more than $384,000 during the quarter.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state has added the Pacific leatherback sea turtle to its endangered species list, guaranteeing more protections for a rapidly dwindling population. The California Fish and Game Commission voted Thursday to add the turtles under the state’s Endangered Species Act. The world’s largest turtle species has been on the federal endangered species list since 1973. But scientists now know more about how crucial California is to its survival, according to Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. A subpopulation of leatherback sea turtles hatches on beaches in Indonesia. Once fully grown, the reptiles swim nearly 6,000 miles to eat jellyfish off the California coast. Adult leatherback sea turtles weigh an average of 1,000 pounds. Scientists say these sea turtles have declined by about 5.6% in California each year for the past three decades. About 50 sea turtles visit the California coast each year, compared to about 178 turtles in the 1990s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Adding turtles to California’s endangered species list will make them a conservation priority for state agencies. It will also increase the state’s cooperation with federal agencies to protect the sea turtle population.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: The fire, floods and massive debris flows of the past year in Glenwood Canyon could help answer an aeons-old question – where exactly does the underground source of water that feeds Hanging Lake begin? The U.S. Forest Service is working with scientific consultants from the renowned Ozark Underground Laboratory out of southwest Missouri to conduct an experiment that may answer the question once and for all. The team recently placed special carbon samplers at key locations in Hanging Lake and at points where multiple springs emerge at the lake and Spouting Rock above the lake, as well as in nearby surface streams. Then, they traveled into the Flat Tops above Glenwood Canyon to place nontoxic fluorescent tracer dye into the water at various potential source points. The idea is that the dye will travel through the canyon’s extensive karst system of caves and sinkholes. Whichever color dye or dyes come out at Hanging Lake should identify the source. Water travels through limestone deposits deep underground and eventually pools amid the steep cliffs at what’s become one of the most popular hiking destinations within the White River National Forest. That passage through the travertine formation and the unique vegetation in and around the lake give Hanging Lake its unique turquoise-green color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPreston: The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, which owns and operates Foxwoods Resort Casino, is seeking to develop a luxury RV resort on land the tribal nation has owned since 1994. The tribe and Blue Water Development Corp., of Ocean City, Maryland, recently filed plans for the proposed park in Preston, to include camping sites, a pool, a water slide, a splash pad, tennis and volleyball courts, a playground, a camp store and a picnic pavilion. The project, located just north of Foxwoods, will be discussed Tuesday at the Inlands Wetlands and Watercourses Commission meeting. Blue Water has completed eight projects of similar size and scope in various states. This latest project comes after a record number of recreational vehicles were sold over the past year in the U.S. “We have waited many years to find the best use and environmentally-conscious partner for this property as we look to thoughtfully enhance our resort experiences,” said Jason Guyot, president and CEO of Foxwoods, in a written statement. He has said previously that Foxwoods has long considered a high-end RV park option for its patrons.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The city’s two municipal beaches, formerly known as Beach 1 and Beach 2, are getting brand-new names. Beach 1, which sits at the end of Savannah Road, will now be known as Savannah Beach. Mayor Ted Becker said the geographic name seems “intuitive.” Just down the coast, the former Beach 2 has officially been renamed Johnnie Walker Beach – a nod to a prominent Black business owner who opened a restaurant there and created a welcoming atmosphere for Black families during segregation. While many people recall that the small port city of Lewes was largely known as a diverse and welcoming area in the 1950s and ’60s, Jim Crow laws still segregated significant parts of life – including the resort town’s two beaches. But Johnnie Walker’s, a restaurant and open-air pavilion where live music often played, was a place where people ate fish sandwiches and french fries, teenagers danced until their shoes were worn out, and families found a sense of belonging, according to people who shared stories from this time. Becker said the city is working with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to possibly recreate the Johnnie Walker pavilion on that beach.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Indigenous groups and other environmental activists marched to the Capitol on Friday as they continued a weeklong protest demanding that Congress and the Biden administration stop new fossil fuel projects and act with greater urgency on climate change. Nearly 80 people were arrested on the fifth day of the “People vs. Fossil Fuels” protest, bringing the total arrested during the week to more than 600, organizers said. Under a banner declaring “We did not vote for fossil fuels,” activists pressed President Joe Biden to stop approving new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects and declare a climate emergency. Demonstrators urged members of Congress to “listen to the people” who sent them to Washington and take urgent action to phase out fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Capitol Police said 78 people were arrested on obstruction or crowding charges. Three of those arrested also were charged with assault on a police officer. The Capitol protest followed a sit-in Thursday at the Interior Department in downtown Washington. The protest was part of “a historic surge of Indigenous resistance” in the nation’s capital that started last Monday, Indigenous Peoples’ Day, outside the White House, said Jennifer Falcon, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, part of the coalition that organized the protest.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The gunman who killed 14 students and three staff members at a Parkland high school will plead guilty to their murders, his attorneys said Friday, bringing some closure to a South Florida community more than three years after an attack that sparked a nationwide movement for gun control. The guilty plea would set up a penalty phase in which Nikolas Cruz, 23, would be fighting against the death penalty and hoping for life without parole. Cruz attorney David Wheeler told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer that he will plead guilty Wednesday to 17 counts of first-degree murder in the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The pleas will come with no conditions, and prosecutors still plan to seek the death penalty. That will be decided by a jury, with the judge hoping to start the trial in January after choosing a jury from thousands of prospects starting in November. Cruz will also plead guilty to 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He was not initially present during the hearing but later entered the Broward County courtroom to plead guilty to attacking a jail guard nine months after the shooting. Cruz said he understood that prosecutors can use the conviction as an aggravating factor when they later argue for his execution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of the world’s largest elevator towers will soon be opened to test elevators of the future as well as current ones high above the Atlanta suburbs. TK Elevators’ 420-foot tower is set to become fully operational early next year, company executives said during a tour of the new research lab and elevator testing facility. “This is going to transform our industry,” said Kevin Lavelle, CEO of the company’s North American operations. It’s the largest elevator test tower in the Western Hemisphere, according to the company and general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie, which built it. The tower with its multiple elevator testing shafts looks down into the Atlanta Braves’ stadium nearby and offers stunning views of the Atlanta skyline. It’s next door to the company’s new North American headquarters in Cobb County, just northwest of the city. Construction on the tower began in 2019 with 3,000 tons of steel, and the structure is now in place, with interior work still ongoing as TKE prepares to fully open it in February. Among concepts being tested in the high-rise: twin elevators, which use the same elevator shaft but operate independently, with one car above the other, Lavelle said. Twin elevators save space and are able to carry passengers more efficiently, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state can expect above-average rainfall during the upcoming wet season and potentially have more floods like last winter, the National Weather Service said Friday. Even so, Maui County and the Big Island may remain in drought and at greater risk for wildfires because the leeward sides of their islands won’t get as much rain. The strength of this year’s La Nina weather event will likely influence rainfall patterns across the island chain. La Nina is a cooling of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures near the equator and the flip side of a warmer El Nino pattern. Kevin Kodama, the weather agency’s senior service hydrologist in Honolulu, said La Nina is expected to be moderate this year. That will mean heavy rainfall on the windward sides of the islands and drier leeward sides during the wet season, which runs from this month through April. That’s similar to the last wet season. Under this scenario, Kauai and Oahu, which have some areas of moderate drought, will likely recover, but drought is expected continue on Maui County and the Big Island. Ranchers in leeward Maui County – areas currently in extreme and severe drought – have recently lost cattle due to the dry conditions. A lack of vegetation in the forests has pushed invasive Axis deer into farms, leading to agricultural losses.\n\nIdaho\n\nAmmon: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin held a news conference Thursday to defend her decision to refuse to release public records until she lost a lawsuit over the matter, criticizing the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and accusing several news organizations of lying in their coverage of the civil case. Her remarks at an elementary school in Ammon included campaign talk that may have violated a state law against campaigning on public school grounds. McGeachin held the event with Republican Attorney General candidate Art Macomber, of Coeur d’Alene, saying she wanted to “set the record straight” regarding the lawsuit from the Idaho Press Club. She refused to take any questions. “I know the media is very busy writing lies about me and my office,” she said. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. The panel was ordered to investigate allegations of “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system, something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” The journalists requested public feedback forms and other documents.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that she took her fight with the head of the city’s police officers union to court, arguing that his call for officers to ignore the order to report their COVID-19 vaccination status was illegal. The mayor said in a statement that the city’s law department filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court for injunctive relief against Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara, whom she accused of “engaging in, supporting and encouraging work stoppage or strike.” A judge on Friday evening granted the city’s request for a temporary injunction barring Catanzara from making any public comments that encourage FOP members to disobey the city’s vaccine mandate until the next hearing on the city’s lawsuit Oct. 25. Judge Cecilia Horan ruled there was potential irreparable harm if Catanzara continued such statements. City attorneys argued they were tantamount to him advocating “sedition” and “anarchy” because he was directing members to disobey an order from their superiors. Lightfoot said that by urging union members not to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday’s deadline, Catanzara put the public in danger.\n\nIndiana\n\nKnox: An Israeli company has started work to build a solar energy farm that’s planned to cover some 13,000 acres across two northern Indiana counties when completed. Executives of Doral Renewables took part in a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday with Gov. Eric Holcomb and local officials for the project that is estimated to cost $1.5 billion to build over the next few years. The project, dubbed Mammoth Solar, will see solar panels erected in Starke and Pulaski counties, generating electricity that Doral will sell under a long-term agreement to American Electric Power for the Columbus, Ohio-based utility company to increase its renewable energy capacity. The solar farm’s first phase is expected become operational by mid-2023 and will produce 400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 75,000 households, according to the company. Construction is planned to start next year on other phases of the farm, which will ultimately generate 1.65 gigawatts of electricity as those portions begin operating in 2024. Proposals for large solar farms have faced opposition in some places over loss of farmland. But Starke County Commissioner Mark Gourley said he was excited about the project coming to the rural area about 50 miles southwest of South Bend. “I’ve never in my life seen anything like this project here,” Gourley said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republican leaders are calling for a new round of tax cuts after a state panel projected Friday that Iowa would take in more money this year than previously expected. Iowa’s three-member Revenue Estimating Conference, which sets the revenue projections that lawmakers use to form the state budget, has increased its revenue estimate for the next two budget years after the state saw an 11% year-over-year growth the year before. Panel members expect state revenues will continue to grow but at a more modest rate – about 1.5% – for each of the next two years. Iowa Republicans credited their budgeting practices and pandemic policies and immediately pointed to the results as reason to cut taxes. But Democrats said the credit for the state’s recovery should go to the federal pandemic relief package that Republicans opposed, and any new tax cuts should be sustainable and focus on middle-class families. Rep. Chris Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, didn’t rule out agreement on tax cuts, but he said in a statement that Republicans need to also focus on investing in areas that will attract and keep families in Iowa. “Any tax changes made next session must be targeted to middle class families, not just the wealthy and special interests,” he said in the statement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A task force formed three years ago to investigate clergy sexual abuse in Catholic dioceses across the state has received 215 tips and opened 122 cases, according to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Robert Jacobs, executive officer of the KBI, reported on the work of the agency’s Catholic Clergy Taskforce last week during a hearing of a state legislative committee. He said investigators set up a phone line and email address for people to report abuse, The Kansas City Star reports. The task force has been working with Catholic dioceses to review almost 40,000 diocesan records since its work began in 2019, Jacobs said. Along with considering a specific allegation, investigators are working to determine if the allegation was made to the diocese or to law enforcement “and what the follow-through was on that claim when it was initially made.” State Sen. Jeff Pittman, D-Leavenworth, questioned why no prosecutions had arisen from the investigation. “Why, with 40,000 different records, there doesn’t seem to be any action on this?” Pittman said. “Is the pursuit not revealing anything? I mean, it seems like there’s a lot in the news about this. What’s the story?” Jacobs said one issue has been that some of the alleged acts took place years ago. “Obviously, we run into time constraints,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Saying the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the necessity for accessible health care, Gov. Andy Beshear marked a milestone Friday for the state’s relaunched health insurance exchange, where consumers now can shop for health coverage for the coming year. Kentuckians can find out if they qualify for Medicaid and compare private plans on the state’s health care marketplace on the web portal, known as kynect, ahead of the enrollment period that begins Nov. 1. Open enrollment for existing recipients of Medicaid started Friday. In a state with high rates of cancer and other diseases, the portal signed up hundreds of thousands for health coverage before it was shut down by the previous governor. Beshear had already relaunched the state-run portal, and Friday marked the first day consumers could go on the website to review coverage plans for 2022. “People deserve easy access to information about their health plans and their benefits,” Beshear said. “It shouldn’t be hard to secure something that keeps you healthy and, in a pandemic, alive.” The Democratic governor was joined by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in promoting kynect, which offers a centralized place for Kentuckians to apply for health insurance coverage and other benefits.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Once-endangered alligators are thriving in the wild, so state authorities are proposing a deep cut in the percentage that farmers must return to marshes where their eggs were laid. “Over the past 50 years, alligator nest surveys have increased from an estimate of less than 10,000 in the 1970s and 1980s to well over 60,000 nests in recent years,” the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission said in a notice published Wednesday. “This increase in nesting has produced a population that can now be sustained with a much lower farm return rate.” The commission is taking comments until Jan. 4 on a proposal to cut that rate from 10% to 5%. The big armored reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers are allowed to collect eggs from nests as long as they return a percentage to the same area as youngsters big enough to foil predators other than people and much bigger alligators. Alligator hides are made into luxury leather for products including watchbands, boots and purses. The meat is used in sausages; companies also sell roasts, steaks, ribs, nuggets, jerky and even whole skinned alligators. Forelegs are marketed as “alligator wings.” Uncontrolled hunting nearly wiped out American alligators before Louisiana barred all hunting in 1962.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A law banning obscenities from license plates on Maine’s roads and highways goes into effect Monday, but removing such profanities in a state where such regulation has been unusually lax won’t happen overnight. Currently, there are license plates with salty language including f-bombs, references to anatomy and sex acts, and general insults. One license plate says simply “F---Y0U” – except it’s plainly spelled out. Now, rule-making is getting underway to ensure the law protects First Amendment rights while getting rid of obscene language. The process, which includes public comment, could take two to four months, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said. Requests for so-called vanity license plates that are deemed to be potentially offensive will be on hold in the meantime. Eventually, the state will begin recalling previously issued plates, likely this winter. A majority of states have restrictions on license plate messages that are considered profane, sexually suggestive, racist, drug-related, politically objectionable or religiously offensive. But Maine became the “wild, wild, wild west of vanity license plates” when the state dropped its review process in 2015. “Our anything-goes approach was unusual,” Bellows said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan proposed a $150 million boost in public safety spending Friday. The Republican governor dubbed the plan the “Re-Fund the Police Initiative” and decried “an all-out assault on the entire law enforcement community” at a news conference announcing the plan, The Baltimore Sun reports. The name is a play on the call to defund police, a tactic supporters say aims to address systemic problems in policing and direct spending to other needs, but Hogan called the idea “dangerous far-left lunacy.” The plan would put $45 million toward local law enforcement and $50 million toward state police agency raises and bonuses. It would also spend $24 million on body cameras and training and $10 million on neighborhood grants for safety improvements like lighting and security cameras. Hogan’s proposal would spend $20 million on victim protection, including $14 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to restore funding for victim services providers after federal cuts. The proposal also includes $1 million for the state’s police chief and sheriff’s associations. The governor is set to speak at a joint meeting of the two groups Monday. The General Assembly would need to approve most of the spending Hogan is proposing.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A high-tech buoy designed to enhance maritime safety is being installed in Buzzards Bay, state environmental officials said. The buoy that measures wave height, wave period, wave direction and surface water temperature every 30 minutes will be placed about 4 nautical miles southwest of Cuttyhunk Island, according to a statement last week from the state Department of Environmental Protection. The buoy is a joint project involving the state, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems. “The waters of Buzzards Bay and Cape Cod Bay are precious natural resources in Massachusetts, and we must continue to make strong efforts to protect them for both the public and marine species to benefit from,” state Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides said. “Adding this new buoy in Buzzards Bay will expand Cape Cod’s marine safety network and help ensure safe passage for mariners traveling through these important waters.” The state is providing about $900,000 to purchase, install and operate the buoy. The money is coming from the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Trust Fund, established after a barge spilled 98,000 gallons of oil into the bay in 2003.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state must serve kosher meat, dairy and cheesecake to prisoners observing the Jewish Sabbath and holidays, a federal appeals court said, rejecting arguments that a special menu would be too costly and disruptive. The Corrections Department typically offers a vegan meal to anyone with religious dietary needs. But the appeals court said it was a “substantial burden” on the rights of prisoners who said they instead need meat and dairy to practice their Jewish faith. In a 3-0 opinion this week, the appeals court affirmed a decision by U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. The court analyzed the case under a federal law that protects the exercise of religion in a confined setting. Gerald Ackerman and Mark Shaykin sued after the state in 2013 adopted a vegan religious meal and said Jewish organizations could no longer send food for four holidays. Prisoners can purchase small kosher meat and dairy products at the commissary, but the food can’t be brought into the chow hall. Ackerman and Shaykin said they must eat the special food as meals, not snacks. They also believe they must eat kosher cheesecake on Shavuot, which recalls the ancient harvest of wheat and the delivery of the Torah to Jews. The appeals court said the “cheesecake issue is trickier” than meat and milk, but it affirmed the trial judge’s findings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: Gov. Tim Walz said Friday that he’ll use the Minnesota National Guard to help alleviate staffing shortages at care facilities that are struggling to cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated residents. “These folks need respite care. They’re at a breaking point. They can’t go anymore,” Walz said. The governor went to North Memorial Health Hospital to announce plans for relieving overstretched staffs at long-term care facilities that prevent hospitals from discharging patients into transitional care centers. More than 400 Minnesota hospital patients are currently waiting for beds to open up for incoming patients, he said. Walz said the number of soldiers who will provide that relief and their exact roles have yet to be determined, but it would be a “fairly large contingent.” “We’re not going to send untrained National Guard into an ICU unit, but we can give them the training necessary to provide … the long-term care for the other folks,” he said. Hospitals across Minnesota are at or near capacity, treating just over 1,000 COVID-19 patients. But officials say the problem is due not only to the coronavirus but also to other conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, trauma, scheduled surgeries and a backlog of procedures that began building up earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Russell C. Davis Planetarium is undergoing renovations and expected to reopen at the end of 2023 with a fresh look and more extensive exhibits. This is the first renovation in decades at the site in downtown Jackson. Mike Williams, the planetarium manager, said the city is creating a world-class center for science and technology. “This is going to be something we can present to the world that is in diametrically opposed to a lot of the negative ideas people may have about our state,” Williams said. He said visitors will see interactive exhibits, including some using augmented and virtual technology. Exhibits will showcase recent space missions and projects by NASA and space travel by private companies, he said. He said he hopes new and updated exhibits will inspire students to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers. “It’s a total investment in our kids and the people of our state,” Williams said. The planetarium closed in April 2018 because of a roof leak and interior damage. After the roof was repaired, the city announced in June 2020 that the planetarium would undergo renovations. Those are expected to cost $12 million or so, and plans include establishing a $2 million operational endowment, said John David Lewis, the city’s deputy director of cultural services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three months after creation of a commission to identify cybersecurity risks in state government, Gov. Mike Parson has yet to appoint any members. A state lawmaker said Friday that vulnerabilities exposed on a state website prove the need for just such a panel of experts. Rep. Ashley Aune, D-Kansas City, helped write the section of Senate Bill 49 that created the Missouri Cybersecurity Commission. Parson, a Republican, signed the bill into law in mid-July. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist uncovered a security flaw on a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s web application that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. The newspaper found that the Social Security numbers of perhaps 100,000 teachers and other school officials from around the state were in HTML source code. The Post-Dispatch alerted the department Tuesday, and the agency removed the pages. The Post-Dispatch said it gave the state time to fix the problem before publishing a story Thursday. But Parson on Thursday announced a criminal investigation, alleging the journalist was “acting against a state agency to compromise teachers’ personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for their news outlet. We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished.” Aune accused Parson of a “smear campaign” against the Post-Dispatch journalist when it was Parson’s administration that stored the private information and left it unprotected.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University celebrated the grand opening of its American Indian Hall over the weekend, saying it will serve as a bridge between Native American culture and all other cultures on campus. The event Saturday began with a procession from the current American Indian Center – just over 1,000 square feet in the basement of Wilson Hall – to the new $20 million, 31,000-square-foot building. The procession was led by a Native American honor guard followed by flag-bearers with the state flag and others from Montana’s tribal nations, along with tribal dancers. The building will house the university’s Department of Native American Studies and a working space for the Senior Diversity and Inclusion officer. Classes will start there in January. It also has a kitchen, a drum room, and rooms for tutoring, counseling, advising and cultural ceremonies. Native American art is displayed, and there are furnishings crafted from trees removed from the site where the building now stands. The building is surrounded by gardens with indigenous plants that were planted by MSU Native American students and staff and is heated and cooled by 24 geothermal wells.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s attorney general said Friday that he won’t seek disciplinary action against doctors who prescribe controversial, off-label drugs to treat and prevent coronavirus infections, as long as they get informed consent from patients and don’t engage in misconduct. The office of Attorney General Doug Peterson released a legal opinion saying it didn’t see data to justify legal action against health care professionals who prescribe ivermectin, a decades-old parasite treatment, or hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that former President Donald Trump took to try to prevent a COVID-19 infection. “Based on the evidence that currently exists, the mere fact of prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 will not result in our office filing disciplinary actions,” the Republican attorney general said in the opinion. Many health experts and leading medical groups have been trying to stop the use of both drugs, arguing that they can cause harmful side effects and that there’s little evidence that they help. It’s also unclear whether many doctors are actually prescribing them in Nebraska or elsewhere, although a few isolated cases have emerged nationally.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The COVID-19 pandemic helped expose the growing vulnerability of Lake Tahoe’s increasingly tourism-dependent economy as housing costs balloon, year-round residency declines, and more workers commute from afar or seek jobs elsewhere, a new report says. The Tahoe Prosperity Center says the findings in the study it commissioned with the help of a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration underscore the need to better diversify Tahoe’s economy, build more affordable housing and utilize an increasingly skilled workforce. “Exorbitant home prices, the high cost of living, long-haul commuters, a shortage of workers, and a flat to down economy over the past 10 years point to an economy that is not healing itself, nor resilient to disruptive changes that impact visitor-based economies more deeply,” the study said. Tourism now accounts for more than 60% of Lake Tahoe’s $5 billion regional economy – up from 40% in 2010, according to the nonprofit center’s research released last week. The report also pointed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive, along with shifting snow and precipitation trends affecting the region’s ski resorts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Mental health advocates are praising the state’s decision to expand services for children by purchasing a private, 111-bed psychiatric hospital. An association that represents the state’s 10 nonprofit community mental health centers called the news “a major milestone in our system.” “This is truly an investment in the future and will ensure that we strengthen our continuity of care,” said Brian Collins, president of the Community Behavioral Health Association. The cost of buying Hampstead Hospital and other details haven’t been determined, but it will be covered by federal pandemic relief funds pending approval of the legislative fiscal committee and Executive Council. The facility has had contracts with the state during the coronavirus pandemic to treat children in mental health crises. “Band-Aids and short-term solutions are not going to cut it,” Gov. Chris Sununu said while announcing Thursday that the state is in the final stages of the purchase. In late March 2020, for the first time in eight years, no one in New Hampshire was waiting in a hospital emergency room for an inpatient psychiatric bed. But the numbers went back up during the pandemic. By May 2021, more than 80 mental health patients, including record numbers of children, were waiting on any given day.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: An apartment complex from which 45 families were abruptly evacuated due to a rock slide stemming from the remnants of Hurricane Ida will be demolished, according to the lawyer representing the property owner. Attorney Steven Eisenstein handed evacuees checks for returned security deposits, October’s rent and an extra $1,250 per unit to help cover relocation costs during a community meeting Thursday, NJ.com reports. Eisenstein said three engineering firms had recommended to owner John Jakimowicz that the Ron Jolyn Apartments in West Orange be demolished. “It’s not that he has any choice,” Eisenstein said. The red brick garden apartment complex was evacuated late last Monday hours after a township employee opened an email sent Friday night warning that a steep, rocky slope behind the apartments was unstable and could result in property damage and “possible loss of life.” Mayor Robert Parisi said the township would go on paying for the hotel accommodations of evacuees while they sought new permanent housing. Evacuees voiced anger and frustration with the evacuation conducted from 10 p.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Tuesday with no warning to tenants, who had little time to gather what belongings they could carry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A judge on Friday denied a request by dozens of scientists and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory to block a vaccine mandate, meaning workers risked being fired if they didn’t comply with the lab’s afternoon deadline. The case comes as New Mexico extends a mask mandate for indoor spaces across the state, citing persistently high levels of community spread. While the vaccination rate among adults in New Mexico continues to hover below 72%, the lab confirmed Friday that 96% of employees are fully vaccinated. It’s not known how many workers have requested exemptions or how many could end up being fired for declining the shots. The legal challenge was backed by 114 scientists, nuclear engineers, research technicians, designers, project managers and other workers at the lab. Some are specialists and have high security clearance for the work they do, which ranges from national defense to infrastructure improvements and COVID-19 research. The workers claim that the mandate is a violation of their constitutional rights and that lab management has created a hostile work environment. Attorneys for the lab argued in court Thursday that being vaccinated was a condition of working at Los Alamos. State District Judge Jason Lidyard agreed, saying unvaccinated employees will have to find work elsewhere.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Democrat who will likely become the next mayor says he does not intend to get rid of the city’s program for gifted and talented students, nipping plans that outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in an interview on CNN on Friday that de Blasio can’t get rid of the program in the nation’s largest school district until next year, when a new mayor is in place. Adams said he would preserve the program and expand opportunities for advanced learning. In response, the city’s department of education noted that Adams’ plans to expand accelerated learning in schools match the goals of de Blasio’s plan to replace the gifted and talented program. De Blasio, in a radio interview Friday, again defended his plan that would begin next year to phase out the program, which critics say favors white and Asian American students, while enrolling disproportionately few Black and Latino children. De Blasio said the district, with about 1 million students, would next year stop administering a screening test to 4-year-olds that’s used to identify gifted and talented students. Instead, he said the public school system would work to offer accelerated learning to all kindergarteners.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nElizabeth City: A northeastern North Carolina judge changed her voter registration from Democrat to Republican the day after she was sworn in to the job for which Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper appointed her. District Court Judge Jennifer Karpowicz Bland switched her registration Sept. 3, according to Dare County elections records. The former assistant district attorney was sworn in Sept. 2, the week after Cooper announced Bland would succeed now-Superior Court Judge Eula Reid, The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City reports. There’s no requirement that someone of the governor’s or departing judge’s political party is picked by the governor. Historically, however, governors have often favored someone of their own party to fill vacancies. Bland said her political views never came up during two pre-appointment interviews with Cooper. Bland said she didn’t contact Cooper’s office about her party switch before completing it. “I’ve always been conservative,” Bland said recently. “It’s the party that best represents my values.” In response to the switch, Cooper’s office focused on criticizing the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing laws in the 2010s to make judicial elections officially partisan again. “It’s still wrong now,” spokesperson Jordan Monaghan said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is offering license refunds to nearly 30,000 deer hunters due to an outbreak of a viral disease in the western part of the state. It’s the second straight year that North Dakota’s Game and Fish Department is offering refunds to thousands of hunters. The department says it has received nearly 1,000 reports of dead deer after epizootic hemorrhagic disease, known as EHD, surfaced in late August. The disease, transmitted by biting gnats, seems to be affecting a larger portion of the state than usual, Wildlife Chief Casey Anderson said. Game and Fish Wildlife Veterinarian Charlie Bahnson said one theory could be that prolonged drought conditions in the state and record-breaking heat in October created conditions favorable to midges and more viral spread. The heaviest concentration of reported deaths is along the Missouri River, especially to the north and south of Bismarck and Mandan, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Last year’s outbreak was in the southwest and west central parts of the state, and Game and Fish offered license refunds to more than 9,000 hunters. Only about 400 sought refunds. Bahnson said nearly 30,000 hunters are potentially affected this year. Hunters and landowners are asked to report any dead deer, along with photos, through an online wildlife mortality reporting system.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Democrats in the state House are calling for action on legislation that would remove time limits restricting when sexual assault victims could file lawsuits against perpetrators. The lawmakers are also urging that hearings be held on a bill that would lift caps on pain-and-suffering awards in lawsuits brought by rape victims. The bills in question focus on separate issues encompassing sexual assault. One involves lawsuits brought by long-ago survivors of sexual abuse, a measure backers say could assist both victims of priest abuse and – in a recent high-profile case – abuse perpetrated on hundreds of student-athletes by former Ohio State team doctor Richard Strauss. That bill would also eliminate the spousal exception for marital rape. The other bill involves recent state Supreme Court rulings dramatically reducing jury awards to child survivors of rape. The issue is not partisan, said Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron. “We have a combining of victims now coming forward, and survivors, friends of survivors, family of survivors, combining with the Strauss victims who’ve been reaching out to our office to contact us,” she said at a Thursday news conference. A separate Republican bill meant to assist survivors of Strauss is stalled, and a GOP lawmaker last week suggested it was never meant to pass but only pressure Ohio State to settle. A federal judge dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State last month, agreeing with OSU’s argument that the legal window for such claims had passed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health says it will reconcile its tally of COVID-19 deaths with those reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resulting in more than 1,000 additional deaths. “This is part of our annual review process that we do every year for reportable diseases,” not just COVID-19, state epidemiologist Dr. Jolianne Stone said. The review is required of all states and, in Oklahoma, will result in an estimated 1,053 COVID-19 deaths when the CDC publishes the data Monday, Stone said Thursday. The update will also result in an estimated 1,366 additional coronavirus cases in the state, she said. The department, which investigates each death, has for months reported the CDC’s provisional death count based on death certificates. The health department on Friday reported a total of 10,826 deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, based on the CDC’s provisional death count.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals has reversed a lower court’s decision to throw out an age discrimination lawsuit against a gun retailer, declaring it illegal to deny gun sales to buyers between the ages of 18 and 20. Brandy Dalbeck filed a $10,000 lawsuit against Bi-Mart in 2018 after the company’s Florence store refused to sell her a hunting rifle when she was 18. Bi-Mart had announced that year it would no longer sell guns and ammunition to people under the age of 21. Companies like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods made similar changes around the same time after 17 students and staff members were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports federal law bans firearms retailers from selling handguns, but not rifles or shotguns, to anyone under 21. Oregon law allows residents to buy shotguns or rifles starting at age 18. Lane County Circuit Judge Charles D. Carlson dismissed Dalbeck’s case without a trial in 2019. In his order for dismissal, Carlson said Oregon’s anti-discrimination law did not prohibit places like Bi-Mart from discriminating against people between the ages of 18 and 20 based on age – and even if the law did, Bi-Mart could adopt a policy against selling firearms to those under 21 as a matter of public safety. Oregon’s appeals court disagreed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nUpper Darby: A woman was raped by a stranger on a commuter train in suburban Philadelphia in the presence of other riders, who a police official said “should have done something.” Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt of the Upper Darby Police Department said officers were called to the 69th Street terminal about 10 p.m. Wednesday after the assault on the westbound train on the Market-Frankford Line. An employee of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority who was in the vicinity as the train went past called police to report that “something wasn’t right” with a woman aboard the train, Bernhardt said. SEPTA police waiting at the next stop found the woman and arrested a man. The woman was taken to a hospital. Bernhardt called the victim an “unbelievably strong woman” who provided police with a lot of information. She did not know her attacker, he said. “She’s on the mend,” Bernhardt said. “Hopefully she will get through this.” The entire episode was captured on surveillance video that showed other people on the train at the time, Bernhardt said. “There was a lot of people, in my opinion, that should have intervened; somebody should have done something,” Bernhardt said. “It speaks to where we are in society; I mean, who would allow something like that to take place?”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation is providing a $250,000 grant to purchase thousands of opioid overdose prevention kits until a more sustainable source of state funding is in place. The grant announced recently to the University of Rhode Island will enable the Community First Responder Program at its College of Pharmacy to purchase approximately 3,000 Narcan kits for distribution to community-based recovery and harm reduction organizations across the state, the foundation said in a statement. There is a critical need for the kits. Supplies of Narcan, also known as naloxone, are seriously depleted as drug overdoses rise. According to state Department of Health figures, 384 Rhode Islanders died of a drug overdose last year. “Narcan kits are a simple solution to a deadly problem. While our funding will save lives, it’s just a large, yet critically needed Band-Aid until a sustainable funding source is put in place,” foundation President and CEO Neil Steinberg said. The funding will provide about a two-month supply of Narcan. The Rhode Island Foundation is the largest and most comprehensive funder of nonprofit organizations in the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An elementary school teacher surrendered to authorities Friday after being accused of having marijuana edibles in a student prize box in her classroom. The 27-year-old teacher from Lexington was behing held on a charge of possession of a Schedule I drug. Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon said the teacher bought a mixed bag of candy to give to her students at Rocky Creek Elementary School, and two students were allowed to get a prize from the candy box Sept. 23. “Marijuana edibles are cannabis-based food products. They come in many forms, but the items in this case were candy,” Sheriff Jay Koon said, adding that while they looked similar to traditional candy brands in wrappers with bright colors, they are illegal in South Carolina. According to the arrest report, one student grabbed a pack of “Stoney Patch Kids” gummies, believing they were “Sour Patch Kids,” and though the teacher told the student to get something else, the child still left with marijuana edibles. The other student grabbed a lollipop. After getting the prize, the student with the gummies went to an after-school day care program and asked his teacher there to help him open the pack. The teacher saw that the candy was not “Sour Patch Kids,” did not open the pack, and contacted the child’s school, the deputy’s report said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A junior mineral exploration company is making a new push to find gold in the Black Hills. Solitario Zinc Corp. arrived in Spearfish in July. Todd Christensen, a geologist with Solitario, said the company was invited to evaluate some claims from a group of investors, and “we saw it as an opportunity to get our foot in the door and to evaluate exploration potential.” Solitario will be combing through 580 mining claims that make up about 11,600 acres of land in Lawrence County. Christensen said the company plans to conduct a multiyear surface exploration program and intends to look for deposits like the Homestake deposit. The former Homestake Mine near Lead became the largest and deepest gold mine in North America and generated 40 million ounces of gold during its 126-year life. In 2002, it closed and became an underground research facility. Homestake’s origins were in the Black Hills gold rush of the 1870s. “Currently, we’re collecting samples to get an understanding of the geology and the mineralization potential,” he said. Christensen told the Black Hills Pioneer that Solitario has focused on zinc in recent years but expanded to gold after a geologist with South Dakota roots gave a presentation at a mineral exploration conference in Toronto.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has limited the ability for now for the nonprofit running Oak Ridge National Laboratory to place employees on unpaid leave who receive exemptions to a COVID-19 vaccine requirement. U.S. District Judge Charles Atchley in Knoxville issued the temporary restraining order Friday barring UT-Battelle from placing employees on indefinite unpaid leave or firing them after they receive a religious or medical accommodation to the vaccines. The six workers who sued have argued they were told the unpaid leave would be indefinite. Their employer said in a court filing that the leave will last 60 days – with health benefits intact – and then will be reevaluated. Those with security clearances will maintain them for 90 days, the filing said. The judge wrote that he will decide by Oct. 29 whether to let the order expire or keep it while the case plays out. He reasoned that “preventing their (employees’) placement on unpaid leave for a matter of two weeks simply will not harm” the organization, while the unpaid leave presents a “functional loss of employment” and other damages for the workers at the lab, which is about 25 miles west of Knoxville. The judge wrote that the order shouldn’t be interpreted that he is inclined to block the order permanently.\n\nTexas\n\nSouthlake: A school district administrator told teachers that if they have books about the Holocaust in their classrooms, they should also have books that offer “opposing” or “other” viewpoints on the subject. Gina Peddy, the executive director of curriculum and instruction for the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, issued the directive this month during a training session about which books teachers can have in their classroom libraries. A staff member secretly made an audio recording of the training session and shared it with NBC News, which broke the story. In the recording, Peddy told the teachers to remember a new Texas law that requires teachers to present multiple perspectives when discussing “widely debated and currently controversial” issues. She said: “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust that you have one that has an opposing – that has other perspectives.” “How do you oppose the Holocaust?” one teacher asked. “Believe me,” Peddy said. “That’s come up.” Texas and some other Republican-controlled states this year moved to regulate what can be taught about race-related ideas in public schools and colleges amid the nation’s racial reckoning after last year’s police killing of George Floyd.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city received more than $1million last year to develop the community from a grant program run by the federal government but only spent about two-thirds of the money. Each year, the city of St. George is given money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make community improvements, especially for moderate- to low-income residents. In the most recent year, the city only used 66% of those funds on community projects. Some went to donations to public service organizations and to purchase fire protective equipment. The Community Development Block Grant funds are meant to be used on providing housing, a suitable living environment and expansion of economic opportunities, according to HUD. “There is a lack of decent affordable units across the board,” said a report in which CDBG detailed the housing situation in St. George. Although the city didn’t use any CDBG funds on creating more affordable housing, the CDBG report indicates the city is trying to remove barriers to accessing affordable housing primarily through encouraging a mix of housing choices such as single-family homes and single-bed apartments and promoting various lot sizes in developments to allow for increased densities.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A group of housing advocates are promising to camp outside the Statehouse until the state does more to help homeless people, one of the advocates said Friday. Brenda Siegel, of Newfane, and others want the expanded eligibility for housing assistance to stay in place through the end of the year. Begun amid the pandemic, the aid is set to expire Thursday. The advocates also want the state to accept federal funds intended for that purpose. “Any measure taken must include people who are on the street now and may be in the future,” Siegel said in an email Friday. In July, the state extended the hotel voucher program, which is used to provide shelter for some of those who experienced homelessness during the pandemic, through mid-September. Gov. Phil Scott later moved to keep the program running for 30 days, until Oct. 21, so a replacement could be developed. On Friday, Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for the governor, said in an email that the replacement plan is nearing completion and that a further extension would be included, without providing details. Meanwhile, Siegel said in a text Friday that the advocates would be using sleeping bags to camp in the front of the Statehouse “until appropriate action is taken.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBurke: A man who works for the sergeant-at-arms of the U.S. House of Representatives has been charged with possession of child pornography, according to police. Stefan Bieret, 41, of Burke, was arrested Wednesday and charged with 10 felonies related to possessing child pornography, Fairfax County police said. The Washington Post reports he’s being held without bond and is expected back in court next month. Bieret’s attorney did not return calls seeking comment. The investigation began when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was notified of a potentially illicit image uploaded to a Dropbox account, police said. The matter was reported to a task force on internet crimes against children. The owner of the account was found to live in Fairfax County. County detectives took over the investigation in August. A search warrant on the Dropbox account turned up additional images of child sexual abuse, and subsequent search warrants led detectives to identify the owner of the account as Bieret, officials said. On Wednesday, Fairfax detectives executed a search warrant on Bieret’s home and recovered multiple electronics. Bieret works as a program manager for the sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement and protocol officer for the House of Representatives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools is suspending 142 school bus routes beginning Monday. District officials said the cuts are necessary because of a national bus driver shortage and because some drivers are choosing not to follow the state-mandated COVID-19 vaccine rules for public employees, The Seattle Times reports. District spokesman Tim Robinson said out of the 18,000 students who are eligible for bus rides, about 6,740 could be affected by the bus route cuts. The 142 bus routes being suspended will not affect students in special education classes, students with individualized education programs, or Section 504 plans that include public transportation services, students experiencing homelessness and foster students. Schools at interim sites or those that serve “high proportions of historically underserved students” also won’t be affected, an email sent to parents Friday said. The district doesn’t know how many students will actually be affected by route shortages because the number of students who ride the bus fluctuates every day, Robinson said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is ready to move forward with a plan to expand long-sought broadband access in rural communities at a potential cost of more than $1 billion, Gov. Jim Justice announced Friday. The plan, which Justice called the largest investment in broadband in the state’s history, will combine federal and state funding with private-sector investments and aims to bring broadband availability to at least 200,000 additional homes and businesses. “We’re going to change the trajectory of West Virginia in a bigger and better way,” Justice said at a event announcing the program. The plan will combine the state’s $236 million commitment with $362 million in funding from the Federal Communication Commission and $120 million from other state and federal resources, the governor’s office said in a news release. Most of the state funding comes from its share of federal American Rescue Plan allocations. The statement said the money will be allocated through competitive programs that draw additional matching funds from private-sector and local government partners. State Economic Development Director Mitch Carmichael said the plan will boost the ability for rural areas to offer distance learning, remote work and telehealth options.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources policy board plans to vote this week on whether to hire its own attorneys in a pair of lawsuits seeking to block the fall wolf hunt, underscoring the deepening rift between the board’s Republican members and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul. The department announced Friday that the board will convene remotely Monday to take the vote. Board Chairman Fred Prehn said he’s not sure Kaul’s Department of Justice will represent board members’ pro-wolf management position in court because its attorneys aren’t talking to board members. “We haven’t met with them; they haven’t talked to any board members or talked strategy,” Prehn said. “The board feels it’s not being consulted.” Prehn has been at odds with Evers since his term on the board expired in May. The governor appointed Sandra Naas to replace him, a move that would give Evers appointees majority control of the panel. Prehn, who was appointed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, has refused to step down. He maintains he doesn’t have to leave until the Senate confirms Naas. Republicans control the Senate and have made no moves toward a confirmation vote, ensuring the board remains under GOP control.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A 103-year-old man has set a record for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America. Fred Miles doesn’t speak much, but he can hum his way around a melody, and the one coming out of his mouth this past summer as he looked down from the top of the Bridger Gondola at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort was “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” by John Denver. But Miles, 103, wasn’t going home via a car or a road just yet. First he was going tandem adaptive paragliding. It would be his first experience flying, seated in a wheeled cart with a paraglider behind him. It would also be the record-setter for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America.But as his son, Greg Miles, reminded his father just before the flight, it would be far from his first time navigating the skies, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “Part of the reason you’re not going to have a problem is because of your flying experience,” Greg, a former town councilor, told his father. The senior Miles first piloted a plane 81 years ago after joining the United States Army Air Corps, which eventually became the Air Force. He joined the force after graduating from Syracuse University with an engineering degree and flew in World War II, again in the Korean War and afterward for some time, for a total of 30 years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/10/molly-denali-saloon-discourse-ashes-mail-news-around-states/39670063/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCarbon Hill: Two city leaders have resigned after their mayor posted a comment on Facebook about “killing out” socialists, “baby killers,” and gay and transgender people. But Mayor Mark Chambers refused to step down and told residents he plans to run for re-election. Protesters staged a die-in and then confronted Chambers at a meeting Monday, where he sat between two empty chairs. Some asked just how he’d like to kill them. One carried a sign saying, “If you kill me, my ghost will haunt you.” The meeting soon ended, with Chambers walking out past people calling for him to resign. He met privately beforehand with a small group of protesters. Resident Rawsy McCollum says the mayor apologized and said his comments shouldn’t have been public. But McCollum says he shouldn’t have voiced hatred at all, and it’s time for him to go.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Natives are sharing their world with a general audience in the nation’s first-ever children’s series featuring indigenous leads. “Molly of Denali” premieres Monday on PBS Kids. The animated show highlights the adventures of a 10-year-old Athabascan girl, Molly Mabray. Her family owns the Denali Trading Post in the fictitious community of Qyah, which has a diverse population. Native Americans voice the indigenous characters. The series is co-produced by Boston-based WGBH and animation partner Atomic Cartoons in collaboration with Alaska Native advisers and script writers. The 30-minute show will run mornings seven days a week. WGBH executive producer Dorothea Gillim says PBS ordered 38 half-hour episodes besides the hourlong premiere. Each episode also includes a short video featuring real Alaska Native children living life in the vast state.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: Dozens of city employees in this Phoenix suburb will use self-driving vehicles at work in partnership with Waymo, an autonomous vehicle company. The partnership will begin this month as Chandler evaluates whether using the autonomous vehicles cuts costs to maintain and operate its vehicles and makes employees more productive. Officials say the program will last at least a year. Chandler has been a leader on testing autonomous vehicles in metro Phoenix. Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project, has been testing its autonomous vehicles in the area since 2016. The partnership will let employees use the Waymo app to schedule rides to work meetings within the company’s service area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will visit the city later this year as part of a lecture series put on by the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton School of Public Service. Ginsburg became the second female justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993 after then-President Bill Clinton nominated her to the post. She’s to speak Sept. 3 on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Ginsburg missed six days of arguments last term as she recovered from surgery for lung cancer, but she returned to the bench in February. In March, fans marked her 86th birthday by wearing workout gear and exercising in front of the high court in a nod to Ginsburg’s well-known workout routine. The Little Rock event is open to the public.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state Senate on Monday sent legislation to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk that will spend $130 million a year over the next decade to improve drinking water for about a million people. Roughly 1 million of California’s nearly 40 million residents don’t have access to clean drinking water because of pollution from humans or natural causes, a fact state lawmakers have called an embarrassment for a state with the fifth-largest economy in the world. The problem is statewide, but it is concentrated in the Central Valley – the capital of the state’s $20 billion agriculture industry. Senators approved the measure 38-1. Newsom had proposed a tax on most residential water bills to address the problem. But state lawmakers were wary of approving a new tax in a year when they had an estimated $21.5 billion surplus. Instead, on Monday the state Senate approved a bill that would authorize spending up to $130 million each year on the state’s distressed water districts, with most of it coming from a fund aimed at fighting climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A giraffe herd at a local zoo has welcomed its 16th member following the birth of a calf. The 10-year-old reticulated giraffe named Msitu gave birth Saturday at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The zoo says the calf was about 6 feet tall at birth and weighed more than 150 pounds. Zoo officials say the mother and calf appear to be doing well. The sex of the calf has not yet been confirmed. The zoo waits 30 days before naming babies. Pregnancies for reticulated giraffes can last up to 15 months. The calf is Msitu’s third. She gave birth to Emy in 2013 and to Rae in 2017. Emy lives at a zoo in Peoria, Illinois. Rae remains with the Colorado Springs herd.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwalk: A federal judge has cleared the way for state and federal transportation officials to move forward with a $1.1 billion replacement of a 122-year-old movable railroad bridge in the city. U.S. District Court Judge Stefan Underhill ruled Monday against opponents who had filed a lawsuit that argued there are cheaper alternatives for replacing the Walk Bridge. The Norwalk Harbor Keeper and others say that unlike a century ago, few boats with tall masts currently pass in and out of the Norwalk River. They had suggested replacing the bridge with a fixed bridge that would save taxpayers money and cause less disruption to the environment. In his ruling, Underhill said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. He also found the government made its decision properly after considering other options.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Leo E. Strine Jr., the state’s witty and sometimes controversial Supreme Court chief justice, is stepping down from the bench with about half his term remaining. Strine delivered his resignation letter to Gov. John Carney on Monday, saying he plans to retire in the fall. A press release from the governor’s office did not detail Strine’s reasons, and the chief justice’s spokesman said he is on vacation and not available for comment. During his tenure, the court invalidated the state’s death penalty, ruled on controversial land use issues and weighed in on billion-dollar business disputes. His stepping down begins a process in which Carney will nominate his successor, a dance that will be watched closely by legal and corporate circles around the world given Delaware’s prominence in business.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Zoo says the first documented Asian water dragon to be born from the DNA of a single parent has died. The Washington Post reports the zoo says the 2-year-old female lizard died from blood cancer in mid-June. The lizard was born in 2016 through a process known as facultative parthenogenesis, which is when female creatures that can produce sexually instead produce offspring on their own. The lizard was hospitalized after workers found it struggling to breathe. It was later found dead. The zoo says water dragons are native to Southeast Asia and have a life expectancy of up to 15 years. They’re named after their defensive strategy that involves submerging themselves in water and holding their breath for up to 25 minutes.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Voting rights advocates have filed suit against the Florida secretary of state over a new law they say makes it impossible to hold early voting on college campuses. They argue that the law disenfranchises young voters. The measure requires early voting locations to have “sufficient non-permitted parking,” which critics say would virtually ban sites on colleges campuses because of their restrictive parking rules. It was part of a broader voting bill signed into law last month by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The lawsuit against Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tallahassee. Lee did not have a direct hand in drafting the law but would have to enforce it. The plaintiffs include the League of Women Voters and eight young voters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Scientists are learning more about suicides among the state’s farmers – and they say the aftermath of Hurricane Michael could bring more risks to rural areas. New research shows that relationship issues, health-related problems and financial hardship are among the most common factors. A University of Georgia researcher believes Hurricane Michael could pose an additional threat to Georgia’s farming community. Anna Scheyett, dean of the University of Georgia School of Social Work, says farmers are very resilient – but they’re also vulnerable and need support. WABE Radio reports that Scheyett examined 106 cases of suicide among farmers and agriculture workers, which were recorded in the Georgia Violent Death Reporting System from 2008 to 2015.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A large missile defense radar mounted on a modified floating oil platform has returned to the state. Missile Defense Agency spokeswoman Maria Njoku told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the radar is back at Pearl Harbor for regular maintenance and installation of system upgrades. She says shore personnel will conduct inspections and surveys, and crew members will receive training. The Missile Defense Agency plans to keep the $2 billion Sea-Based X-Band Radar at sea for more than 300 days in the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to “address the continued missile test activity in North Korea.” The agency plans to have the radar spend 330 days at sea each year between 2021 and 2024. The military is planning to build a series of land-based sensors that will also track ballistic missiles.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups say a U.S. Forest Service plan to improve wildlife habitat in eastern Idaho will do the opposite and takes an illegal shortcut around environmental laws. Alliance for the Wild Rockies and two other groups filed a lawsuit in federal court last week seeking to halt the Rowley Canyon Wildlife Enhancement Project in Bannock County. The Forest Service in June approved the project that would remove more than half of the juniper trees on about 1,300 acres and remove shrubs on another 400 acres. Federal officials say that will improve habitat for deer, elk and grouse. The environmental groups say it instead will allow cheatgrass and other invasive plants to move in and destroy good habitat.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum Society is offering day trips for people to explore the state’s history and culture this summer by coach bus. The first trip, scheduled Aug. 10, will feature a visit to the Illinois State Museum Lockport Gallery and a 90-minute walking tour of the Old Joliet Prison. The facility was Illinois’ second state prison and operated from 1858 to 2002. It was famously featured in the movie “The Blues Brothers.” The second trip, Sept. 14, will focus on African American history. The first stop will be in New Philadelphia, the site of the first town platted and registered by an African American. The group will then visit the Huck Finn Freedom Center in Hannibal, Missouri. Trips range in cost from $114 to $149.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Tiles with images of swastikas that were installed more than a century ago have been removed from the walls inside an Indiana University building. The school says the tiles at the Indiana University School of Public Health classroom building were installed before the swastika was adopted as the symbol of the Nazi Party. They’re among tiles that include symbols from different cultures. The (Bloomington) Herald-Times reports an explanation of the symbol’s history was posted near the tiles for many years, but some still found the tiles offensive. The school says the swastika tiles will be sanded to remove the symbol and remounted. The tiles were installed during the construction of the original IU Men’s Gymnasium in 1917. It’s now part of the IU School of Public Health classroom building.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A southwest Iowa man has won his free speech legal battle with a sheriff’s department and two officers who charged him with harassment for writing a social media post that profanely criticized a deputy. The Adams County Sheriff’s Office will pay Jon Richard Goldsmith $10,000 to settle a federal lawsuit he filed in May alleging violations of his free speech rights, retaliation and false arrest. The sheriff’s office agreed to a court order filed Monday that prohibits it from bringing criminal charges against or threatening to criminally charge citizens on the basis of the lawful comments, posts or other speech protected by the First Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa represented Goldsmith in the lawsuit against Adams County, Deputy Cory Dorsey and his supervisor.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A violent crime rate about twice the national average has prompted city law enforcement officials to join a national program that aims to drive down crime. The Wichita Eagle reports the city is among 10 selected this year to participate in the U.S. Department of Justice National Safety Partnership. Wichita cited the latest figures published by the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation in its application for the program. Shootings have climbed steadily since 2014. Murders, rapes and aggravated assaults all ticked up between 2016 and 2018. And domestic violence now accounts for nearly half of all aggravated assaults reported in the city. The partnership will provide training and technical assistance to the department at no cost.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city is ramping up the horseplay with a simple message to prospective visitors: Won’t you be my neighhhbor? As part of an ad campaign, VisitLEX, Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau, dressed up a horse as Fred Rogers, the writer and host of preschool television series “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” The star of the campaign is Hank, a 21-year-old horse from the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington. Hank’s outfit was designed by Lexington-based fashion designer Soreyda Benedit Begley. Coincidentally, the horse’s name almost matches that of Tom Hanks, who will portray Rogers in the upcoming film “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” set to be released in November. Lexington, surrounded by more than 400 horse farms, claims to be the horse capital of the world.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCovington: A dispute is developing over whether a hotel and conference center should be developed at a state park. A study paid for by the St. Tammany Parish Tourist and Convention Commission says the project should be built at Fontainebleau State Park near Mandeville. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that the proposed lodge and conference center would offer views of Lake Pontchartrain. It is projected to generate $1.8 million in cash flow in 2021, its first year. That’s projected to grow to nearly $2.3 million by 2025. Critics of the plan say it will draw commerce away from existing businesses in Slidell and Covington. They also question the need for more revenue at a park that they said brings in $1.3 million a year, with expenses of $1.2 million.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A new state law is designed to prevent young children from being suspended or expelled from schools. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed “An Act to Promote Social and Emotional Learning and Development for Young Children” into law. The proposal by Democratic Sen. Cathy Breen of Falmouth is intended to cut down on suspension and expulsion rates by providing a consultation program for teachers and parents of young children. Senate Democrats say the proposal will create a voluntary program that makes consultants with advanced training in mental health and child development available to help “contain the impact of challenging behaviors in the classroom.” The Democrats say Maine has the second-highest rate of preschool student expulsion in the country, and that causes disruptions in the education of the children.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An area in the state that’s home to abandoned World War I-era steamships has been designated a new national marine sanctuary. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the state of Maryland and Charles County announced the Mallows Bay-Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary on Monday. It contains more than 100 abandoned steamships and vessels that were built as part of the nation’s engagement in World War I. It’s about 40 miles south of Washington, D.C., along an 18-mile stretch of Potomac River coast in Charles County. Maryland nominated the area for sanctuary designation in 2014 to conserve the shipwrecks and increase opportunities for public access, tourism and economic development. The sanctuary designation will take effect following 45 days of congressional session after publication of the action in the Federal Register.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A replica of the Mayflower will be sailing to the city as part of commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in Massachusetts. Organizers say the Mayflower II will be on display at the Charlestown Navy Yard from May 14 to May 19, 2020, and visitors will have an opportunity to board the ship for free. The vessel has been undergoing a $7.5 million restoration at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut since 2016. The original Mayflower was lost to history after returning to England following its famous 1620 voyage to the New World. The full-scape replica ship was built in England in the 1950s and has been berthed in Plymouth Harbor. Plans are to bring it back to Plymouth following the Mayflower Sails 2020 event.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The governor has signed legislation honoring the late Queen of Soul with a highway designation. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday approved the bill to designate a portion of M-10 in Detroit as the “Aretha L. Franklin Memorial Highway.” Franklin died in the city last year after battling pancreatic cancer. Whitmer, a Democrat, noted in a statement that Franklin’s “creativity and voice contributed to our musical and cultural history in Michigan.” Supporters of the designation say dedicating a portion of the highway is a way to honor the musical and cultural icon, who grew up in Detroit and learned the gospel fundamentals at New Bethel Baptist Church. Some Republicans who opposed the bill, however, have said such designations should only go to fallen first responders and military veterans.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two University of Minnesota students are launching a prescription drug repository program to redistribute unused medications to people who are struggling to pay for their medicine. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that pharmacy students Rowan Mahon and Hannah Van Ochten were behind the bill to set up the repository, which will begin next year. Gov. Tim Walz approved a state health budget that included the measure this spring. The new law allows care facilities to send unused pills to a central repository, where they’ll undergo safety checks. Mahon says the medicine can’t be expired or show signs of tampering. Once cleared for use, the drugs can be distributed at reduced prices for people in need. Mahon is applying for grants and fundraising to get the program off the ground.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Toxic bacteria are keeping swimmers out of the water on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, and it will be weeks before financial information shows whether beach closures are hurting the local economy. The communications director for the tourism agency Coastal Mississippi, Erin Rosetti, says she’s seeing fewer people hanging out on the sand. “We do see people on the beach. However, we don’t see them en masse as we are used to during this month,” Rosetti said Monday. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality is warning that people and pets should stay out of saltwater near the mainland beaches. The agency started closing some beaches June 22 and on Sunday closed the last two sections near the Alabama line. While the water is off limits, people can still be on the sand.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Officials say a letter filled with a white, granular substance that spurred an evacuation contained human ashes. St. Joseph spokeswoman Mary Robertson said the city finance department evacuated Monday after a staffer opened the letter and saw a bag filled with a white substance inside. The envelope was addressed to the mayor and had been cut open and re-taped shut. Robertson says once emergency officials were able to safely open the envelope, they found a letter explaining that it contained the ashes of a former resident who died last year and had wanted her ashes to be spread around City Hall. Hazmat officials confirmed the substance was human ashes. Robertson says she’s not sure if the ashes will be spread at City Hall.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: In their quest to develop an improved computer that could one day be used in NASA spacecraft, Montana State University researchers have tinkered with their creation on the laboratory bench, dangled it from high-altitude helium balloons, sent it to the International Space Station and launched it into Earth’s orbit on a bread loaf-sized satellite. Now it will go to the moon. NASA announced that an MSU team led by Brock LaMeres has won a coveted spot on a 2020-2021 lunar mission that will be the biggest trial yet for the radiation-tolerant computing concept LaMeres conceived more than a decade ago. “Talk about a moonshot,” said LaMeres, professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering in MSU’s Norm Asbjornson College of Engineering. “The dream has always been to get (this technology, called RadPC) that far out into space.”\n\nNebraska\n\nDenton: The state Game and Parks Commission is inviting families to experience prairie wildlife and enjoy time together during a bioblitz scheduled for Saturday at Denton Prairie in southeast Nebraska. A bioblitz is an intense survey of species within a designated area. Attendees will count as many living things as possible in three hours, with teams looking for birds, insects, plants and more. The day will begin at 7 a.m. with a bird banding demonstration. Participants will begin looking for species about 9 a.m. and halt at noon. Water and snacks will be available; participants are encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Denton Prairie is a part of the Prairie Corridor on Haines Branch, a tallgrass prairie passage that connects Pioneers Park Nature Center to Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center.\n\nNevada\n\nEly: Federal officials say they plan to round up as many as 800 wild horses from vast range in eastern Nevada to reduce what land managers call damaging overpopulation. The Bureau of Land Management says the operation was scheduled to begin Tuesday in a public land study area known as the Triple B Complex. The complex covers about 2,500 square miles in the bureau’s Elko and Ely districts. A statement says helicopters will be used, the roundup should last less than four weeks, and the aim is to reduce the number of wild horses from an estimated 3,400 to about 2,600. The bureau says agents will escort public observers at pre-scheduled times, and captured horses will be checked by a veterinarian and offered for adoption or sale through a bureau program in Sparks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is increasing its efforts to serve its aging population. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu last week signed a bill to create a commission to advocate for elderly residents. The commission will replace a small committee within the Department of Health and Human Services that was composed mostly of volunteers. The new group will include representatives from seven state agencies and a full-time director. Doug McNutt of AARP New Hampshire told New Hampshire Public Radio the state needs to do a better job of adapting to issues affecting the aging population, including workforce issues and housing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, New Hampshire is the second-oldest state. Maine has the highest median age, with New Hampshire and Vermont right behind.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation aimed at helping first responders to the Sept. 11 attacks. The Democrat signed the bills Monday at Liberty State Park, across the Hudson River from the site of the 2001 attacks. One measure permits volunteer first responders to qualify for disability pensions when they retire. It’s aimed at helping those who were not on duty but who helped after the World Trade Center towers fell. A legislative estimate says it’s unclear how much the change would cost. It depends on how many retirees apply, and the estimate doesn’t specify a possible number. The other measure makes it easier for first responders to get workers compensation by removing the burden of proving the cause of an illness in certain cases.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWhite Oaks: A saloon in this ghost town attracts regulars with diverse backgrounds and opinions with a promise to “have dialogue.” The Albuquerque Journal reports the No Scum Allowed Saloon pulls in people from around the state and sometimes tourists from overseas because of its reputation and catchy name. Saloon owner Karen Haughness, one of nine people who live in White Oaks, says the saloon’s regulars often exceed the town’s population. She says the establishment cultivates civil discourse among visitors. The town was founded after gold was discovered in the region in 1879. Outlaw Billy the Kid is said to have visited White Oaks often looking for a good time. White Oaks is 160 miles southeast of Albuquerque.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A county clerk in western New York has filed a lawsuit challenging a new state law authorizing driver’s licenses for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Erie County Clerk Michael Kearns filed the federal court challenge late Monday. The suit seeks a court injunction blocking the law while its constitutionality is reviewed by the court. The lawsuit names Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, as defendants. Kearns says the law forces county clerks to violate their oaths of office by granting licenses to immigrants who have broken immigration law. Supporters of the measure, which passed last month, say they expected a lawsuit and carefully crafted the law to withstand court scrutiny. Twelve states already have similar laws.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation designed to give prosecutors a new tool to convict drug dealers and to require public schools to teach more finance education is now law. The bills are among a dozen Gov. Roy Cooper said Monday that he’s signed into law. One bill makes it a felony to illegally sell drugs that result in an overdose death, punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Supporters say the “death by distribution” law will help fight the opioid epidemic, but critics say it will deter people from calling 911 during an overdose. Another new law requires high school students to pass a personal finance and economics class to graduate. Some teachers worry this will detract from other instruction, but supporters believe financial literacy is critical to real-world success.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials are looking for help collecting an insect that attacks an invasive plant. The state departments of Agriculture and Trust Lands as well as several county weed boards are trying to round up flea beetles and disperse them to feed on leafy spurge, one of North Dakota’s worst noxious weeds. They’ve been running collection days at different locations around the state since late June. The next scheduled day is Thursday along Franks Creek Road north of Fryburg in Billings County. Collection efforts are slated for 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Collectors should bring sweep nets and coolers with ice packs for transporting the beetles.\n\nOhio\n\nWapakoneta: This small city is shooting for the moon in celebrating its native son’s history-making walk 50 years ago this month. The hometown of Neil Armstrong has expanded its usual weekend “summer moon festival” to 10 days of Apollo 11 commemorations, starting this Friday. Tens of thousands of visitors – the biggest crowds here since Armstrong’s post-mission homecoming – are expected. There will be hot air balloons, ’60s-themed evenings, concerts, rocket launches and a visit from five other Ohio astronauts. And “the world’s largest moon pie,” all 50 pounds of it. Event planning began two years ago in this city of about 10,000 that has added nearly 3,000 residents since 1969 but retains that everybody-knows-everybody rural town feel.\n\nOklahoma\n\nKingfisher: No injuries or damage have been reported following several small earthquakes in central Oklahoma. The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 3.1 temblor was recorded at 9:44 a.m. Tuesday 7 miles west of Kingfisher, or about 35 miles west of Oklahoma City. The earthquake was recorded at a depth of 4 miles. Two other earthquakes, both magnitude 2.6, were recorded in the same area Tuesday. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state Senate committee has placed conditions by which Sen. Brian Boquist, R-Dallas, must abide if he enters the Capitol building, stemming from threats he made more than two weeks ago against the Senate president and Oregon State Police. Until a full investigation into his comments is complete, Boquist must give 12 hours advance notice to the secretary of the Senate before he intends to be in the Capitol. When he is in the building, State police will bolster their presence. The Senate Committee on Conduct also voted Monday to advise Boquist he cannot retaliate against anyone who raised concerns about safety because of his comments or anyone who is participating in the investigation. During a recent GOP walkout to protest a cap-and-trade bill, Boquist told state police to “send bachelors and come heavily armed” if they came after him.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nAltoona: A convenience store chain is putting Bitcoin ATMs in six shops around the state, giving customers the ability to buy and sell the cryptocurrency with U.S. dollars. Sheetz, based in Altoona, announced Tuesday that it has teamed up with Coinsource to put the ATMs in the five Pennsylvania stores and a shop in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Ryan Sheetz, a vice president at the company, says the family-owned chain is always trying to be innovative and give customers what they want. Customers must enroll with Coinsource before they can use the ATMs. Then they’ll be able to make transactions from $5 to $5,000 per day from the machines.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingston: State officials are telling visitors to a local pond to watch out for jellyfish. The Department of Health says five people have been treated in emergency rooms after being stung by jellyfish at Potter Pond in South Kingston. Experts say the type of creatures involved, known as clinging jellyfish, are small – about the size of a dime – but pack a powerful sting. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to severe pain and occasionally even respiratory or neurological problems. People wading in the pond are advised to wear protective clothing and take other precautions. Officials say clinging jellyfish typically attach themselves to underwater aquatic vegetation and algae and have been found in other ponds and estuaries. They are not typically found on ocean beaches.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Police say a woman stole a vehicle after throwing a snake at the driver, then crashed through barricades set up for a pole-vaulting exhibition. In a statement, Greenville Police identified the suspect as 29-year-old Hilmary Moreno-Berrios. They she was hurt in Friday’s crash and released from the hospital Monday. Authorities say Moreno-Berrios demanded a woman’s keys and threw a live black snake at her. They say she then drove the stolen SUV, with the snake still in it, into barriers set up for the Liberty Bridge Jump-Off. Moreno-Berrios is charged with carjacking, malicious damage to property and five traffic violations. It wasn’t known whether she had a lawyer to contact for comment on her behalf. Police say the snake wasn’t venomous and was released in nearby woods.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nFort Pierre: A new proposal would ban transporting deer and elk carcasses in some parts of the state to help slow the spread of chronic wasting disease. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to the most restrictive options presented to the commissioners for transporting mule deer, whitetail deer and elk carcasses into and around South Dakota. A final decision is expected in September. If approved, the restrictions would go into effect July 1, 2020. Chronic wasting disease has been found in free-ranging deer and elk in southwestern South Dakota. Staff urged the commission to adopt the most restrictive options to slow the disease’s spread to the rest of the state. CWD is a fatal disease that strikes the nervous system in deer, elk and moose.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Laura Mabel Francatelli survived the sinking of the Titanic wearing a life jacket she cherished for the rest of her long life. Now, for the first time in 107 years, Francatelli’s jacket is on public display. It’s one of six on exhibit through December at the Titanic Museum Attraction in Pigeon Forge. The six life jackets – two linked to surviving passengers and four others with sadder, less certain pasts – are half of the 12 known to still exist from the Titanic. “It’s very poignant,” says Paul Burns, the museum’s curator. “This was a tragedy for the survivors and the victims.” Francatelli’s life jacket was unveiled Tuesday in a ceremony at the museum. Musicians performed “Nearer My God to Thee” – the last song Titanic musicians played – to begin the event.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A borrowed ship has become the floating summer school home for more than 300 maritime students and staff from Texas A&M University at Galveston. The Galveston County Daily News the Golden Bear departed Saturday from the Port of Galveston as part of Sea Aggies training. The 500-foot vessel is normally operated by the California State University Maritime Academy. The Golden Bear set sail with about 260 members of the Corps of Cadets, plus 70 faculty and staff, for two months in the Gulf of Mexico and ocean experience. Daryn Taylor, a senior, says the voyage combines the stresses of college life and being on a working vessel in the open sea. Texas A&M has a smaller training ship, the General Rudder, which can accommodate 50 students.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Four famous paintings will be showcased in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts beginning this fall. The Smithsonian American Art Museum announced Monday that Utah is one of five states in the West selected to host works from American painter Georgia O’Keeffe and others as part of a new initiative to share art with smaller cities throughout the United States. From Oct. 25 until Oct. 4, 2020 visitors can view paintings from O’Keeffe and fellow American painters Thomas Moran and Alma Thomas. A fourth artwork by Mexican painter Diego Rivera will also be on display in a separate project. The museums will contribute their own artwork to a traveling exhibition that will end at the Smithsonian in 2023.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan wants state police to have body cameras. WCAX-TV reports the state police say they’d like to supply troopers with body cameras, but they don’t have the approximately $260,000 a year needed to store the information. Donovan says body cameras have limitations, but they still provide the best evidence as to what happened in some situations. He says they are good for the officer and the citizens because they provide “a true and accurate picture of what transpired at the scene.” Currently members of the state police tactical teams wear body cameras, but troopers do not while on routine patrol. State police officials say obtaining body cameras for all troopers is one of the agency’s top priorities.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: With about a year left before the prescribed closure of the Central Virginia Training Center, the state has moved most of its patients with intellectual and physical disabilities into community-based care settings. But the state is still struggling to comply with other requirements in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and has not yet determined the fate of the complex. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services told a legislative subcommittee Monday that the state has made “excellent progress” in transitioning patients. A DOJ investigation found that the way Virginia treated disabled people in training centers violated their civil rights. Since then, the number of people living in the large institutions has dropped by 89%, from 1,084 to 116.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is suing the Navy over its expansion of jet operations on Whidbey Island. Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the federal lawsuit Tuesday, saying the Navy failed to adequately examine the effects that having nearly 50,000 flights per year would have on people or wildlife. The Navy in March authorized the expansion of its Growler program by up to three dozen jets, adding to the 82 already based on Whidbey Island. The jets conduct electronic warfare to jam enemy communications and launch systems. The Navy’s public affairs office said it does not comment on litigation. Ferguson said that while the Navy has an important job, and its crews must be able to train, it must also follow its obligations to avoid unnecessary harm to human health and the environment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPineville: Nicole Sadecky, a graduate student at West Liberty University, has spent the past year wading the shallows of two southern West Virginia streams, tracking the movements of Cambarus veteranus, colloquially known as the Guyandotte crayfish. She hopes her research might someday help get the rare crawdad off the federal Endangered Species List. The Guyandotte crayfish, once thought extinct, was rediscovered in 2009 by Sadecky’s mentor, West Liberty professor Zac Loughman. Historically, the creature had been found in eight streams, all tributaries to the upper Guyandotte River in Wyoming and Logan counties. Loughman found it at only one site in only one Wyoming County stream, Pinnacle Creek. Subsequent studies discovered the species’ presence in Clear Fork, another Wyoming County stream a dozen miles to the northwest, but that turned out to be the extent of it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nEast Troy: Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young and the Dave Matthews Band will headline Farm Aid 2019 when the music and food festival visits the state’s dairy country this fall. Tickets for the Sept. 21 event at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy go on sale Friday. Farm Aid says the farming economy this year resembles how things were when Nelson founded Farm Aid in 1985. Nelson says devastating weather, low prices, and current federal farm and trade policies pose enormous challenges to family farmers struggling to keep their farms. Other performers include Bonnie Raitt, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, Margo Price, Jamey Johnson, Tanya Tucker, Brothers Osborne, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real, Yola, and Particle Kid. Farm Aid has raised $57 million since 1985.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State and tribal officials are trying to make it easier for people to use tribal identification to register to vote. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan met with leaders of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes last week to talk about how the state could allow tribal IDs to be the only form of identification tribe members would need to register. Tribal IDs can currently be used to register, but a driver’s license, its number or a Social Security number must also be presented. The meetings came after the Wyoming Democratic Party alleged that members of the two Wind River Reservation tribes had difficulties registering to vote for last year’s election. An investigation determined election workers followed the law, and no eligible tribal members were prevented from voting.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/10"}]}

It is known to feed on the bark, leaves and sap of more than 70 plant and tree species, including willows, maples, poplars, tulip poplars, birch and ash. Eight counties are currently under quarantine due to the lanternfly: Warren, Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem.\n\n\"We currently have 13 crews of two who are out searching for and scraping egg masses and will be treating areas when the spotted lanternflies begin hatching in early May,\" a New Jersey Department of Agriculture spokesperson said in a statement sent to NorthJersey.com. \"We are enlisting the help of the state’s citizens to helps us eliminate this insect as much as possible, now through egg mass scrapings and later through treatments on their properties.\"\n\nThe lanternfly's feeding stresses plants and hurts their ability to heal and can kill the trees.\n\nThe bug was first discovered in the U.S. in 2014. It has since spread to New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Ohio. The NJDA is researching natural predators for the lanternfly to control its population.\n\nEmerald ash borer\n\nThis beetle has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees throughout the U.S. and Canada. It was first seen in New Jersey in Somerset County in May 2014. It has made its way to Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex and Warren counties since then.\n\nThe ash borer once caused Morris County to chop down 10,000 ash trees as a safety precaution. It's believed to have first come to New Jersey on wooden packing materials from China.\n\nNine percent of New Jersey's forested areas, mostly in the northwestern part of the state, were threatened by the emerald ash borer.\n\n\"The department has been releasing egg and larval biocontrol parasitoids against this insect in ash stands throughout the state since 2016 to help curb the spread of the emerald ash borer,\" the NJDA stated.\n\nEnvironment:NJ's unequal rules put some at greater risk of drinking lead. These families pay the price\n\nKhapra beetle\n\nThese beetles are native to India. They stow away in grain and seed.\n\n\"Previous U.S. detections of this tiny beetle have required massive, long-term and costly control and eradication efforts,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated.\n\nThey do better in hot weather but are survivors, resistant to many pesticides and able to go a long time without food.\n\nThe khapra spoils much of stored grain and seed products where its found from its feeding, per the USDA.\n\nLonghorned tick\n\nThe first longhorned tick was found in New Jersey in 2017 but could have been in the state longer.\n\nNative to China, Korea and Japan, longhorned ticks are tiny and can infest a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to livestock and wildlife. It is unknown how much of a threat it is to humans. One was found on a Bergen County girl in 2018.\n\nThe tick has been confirmed to be in Bergen, Camden, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, and Union counties in New Jersey. This tick is unique because it is asexual and does not need a mate to reproduce.\n\nGypsy moth\n\nThe gypsy moth is one of the oldest invaders, released into the United States in Massachusetts in 1868. It made its way to New Jersey a half-century later and has been feeding on tree leaves since. More than a million acres of trees have been damaged by gypsy moths since 2007, prompting the state to spray insecticides from planes on wide swaths of forest.\n\nNew Jersey started a suppression program for the moth in the 1970s. The NJDA recommended 170 acres in the state for gypsy moth treatment in 2021, down from 4,500 acres in 2018 and more than 100,000 in 2008.\n\nGypsy moths threaten oak, maple, birch, beech, willow, and hickory trees. The larger caterpillars also have been known to feed on pine, spruce, hemlock, and many common ornamentals, per the NJDA.\n\nJoshua Jongsma is a breaking news editor for NorthJersey.com.

The agency, partnered with the University of Georgia and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), said the finding marked the first detection of the non-native species in \"the open United States.\"\n\nLast month Clemson University’s Plant Industry Department captured a yellow-legged hornet queen in Jasper County and eliminated it's nest the Bluffton Today, part of the USA TODAY Network reported.\n\nIn addition to threatening domestic and feral honey bees, according to the USDA, the hornets threaten crops.\n\nIt was not immediately known how the invasive insects made their way the U.S. soil, but University of Georgia (UGA) scientists found evidence suggesting they originated in Asia.\n\nThe 2024 cicada invasion:How to save your trees and shrubs from damage\n\nGeorgia stepping up efforts to track, kill yellow-legged hornets\n\nThis week, Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said the agency, in coordination with federal and state partners, is \"significantly stepping up\" efforts to eradicate\" the yellow-legged hornet from Georgia.\n\nThe department, according to land management officials, is increasing the number of traps in the Savannah area 170 in 2023 to more than 1,000 traps this year.\n\nHarper also said the department is hiring additional staff and plans to use \"new, cutting-edge technology\" to eradicate the insects.\n\nCrews plan to use new trackers to track the invasive species back to their nests using trackers lighter (.15 grams) than previous trackers used last year (.31 grams), the department said, adding the heavier trackers impacted the hornets ability to fly and impacted the agency's ability to track the hornets.\n\nThe trackers are equipped with wing sensors calibrated to recognize the unique frequency wingbeat of yellow-legged hornets in an effort to alert teams on the ground when they detect the insect's activity.\n\n\"This invasive pest is a threat to native pollinators and our state’s number one industry, agriculture, and we continue to ask for the public’s help as we do everything in our power to achieve complete eradication,\" Harper said.\n\nWhat does a yellow-legged hornet look like?\n\nThe yellow-legged hornet is wasp species can grow up to an inch long, according to the nation's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).\n\nTheir nests, which are large and contain up to 6,000 workers, are made above ground from \"paper-like material\" and in addition to trees, can be found on garages, barns and sheds.\n\nWhen do yellow-legged hornet queens emerge?\n\nMated queens emerge in the spring to find a food source, establish an embryonic nest, and begin producing workers, land management officials said. Once the colony has grown enough, they will establish a much larger secondary nest in the summertime.\n\n\"In our experience these secondary nests are typically located about 80 to 100 feet high in a tree,\" Agvent said.\n\nAccording to APHIS, the species was first spotted in the U.S. in August 2023 when a beekeeper in Savannah reported an unusual hornet on his property to the Georgia land management officials.\n\nAgency staff and pest management professionals destroyed the nest on Aug. 23 in a residential neighborhood on Wilmington Island.\n\nAfter that nest was eradicated, scientists Lewis Bartlett with UGA and Jamie Ellis with the University of Florida examined it and identified developing hornets within the nest but found no evidence of reproductive males or queens in the colony.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The female flies lay eggs that hatch into maggots and tunnel into the flesh of the fruit, officials said. The quarantine is put in place to try to control the spread until the insect can be eradicated from the area.\n\nIt was the second quarantine declared locally in a matter of weeks.\n\nEarlier this month, the California Department of Food and Agriculture announced a citrus quarantine in the Santa Paula area. Officials had found two trees infected with a deadly bacterial disease referred to as HLB or citrus greening. The number has since climbed to 22 trees.\n\nA quarantine is rare in the county, said Agricultural Commissioner Korinne Bell.\n\n\"Over the course of 17 years, we’ve only had three,\" Bell said. \"Now, we have two new quarantines in the course of one month.\"\n\nIt is an anomaly happening statewide, officials said. A record 600 exotic fruit flies have been detected so far in 2023. An average year has 75.\n\nAgency goes door to door\n\nAfter years of drought, a rainy winter and spring likely contributed to the increase. The numbers also quickly ticked up as travel and global commerce resumed after dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA Queensland fruit fly was first detected in September in a residential neighborhood in Thousand Oaks. When a second fly was discovered in the area, the quarantine was put in place.\n\nThe quarantine stretches north to south roughly from the Tierra Rejada Golf Club to the Las Virgenes Reservoir and east to west from Agoura Hills to Wildwood Park.\n\nOfficials urge residents in the area not to move any fruits or vegetables from their property. They can be consumed or processed where they are picked. If they are not consumed, officials asked that the fruit or vegetable be double bagged in plastic and put in a garbage bin, not one intended for green waste.\n\nResidents within a smaller boundary — 200 meters of where a fruit fly was found — already may have gotten a visit from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, officials said. In those areas, staff will let people know about the quarantine and schedule a time to treat plants with an organic-approved pesticide called Spinosad, the department said.\n\nOfficials seek public's help\n\nInspectors also will cut open samples of fruit and vegetables to look for any fruit fly larvae. If they find larvae, they will remove and dispose of fruit within 100 meters of the spot.\n\nIn the larger quarantine area, residents also may see staff placing traps around their neighborhoods. The traps use a pheromone lure that targets exotic fruit flies, according to the state agency.\n\nFor farmers in the quarantine area, the rules require a complex treatment process for fruits and vegetables, according to Bell. Because of the time required, some crops could spoil before they can be sold.\n\nIn both quarantines, the initial detection was found in residential areas. Now, officials say they need the public's help to stop the spread. Some residents have refused to let the work happen, and Bell hopes more outreach about the process may help.\n\n\"We really need the residents' cooperation,\" she said. \"There's a lot at stake.\"\n\nMore information and an interactive map of the quarantine is available at cdfa.ca.gov/plant/qff/regulation.html.

(Australian authorities had imposed tough new biosecurity measures on all arrivals after a foot and mouth disease outbreak in Indonesian livestock.)\n\nIn a separate incident a few days earlier, an Australian woman was fined $1,844 after she forgot to declare a leftover Subway sandwich she bought in Singapore.\n\nIn the past year alone, US border officials have fined passengers for bringing a wide range of undeclared food items in their luggage, including balut eggs, pork bologna and turkey ham. Border officials conducted “630,150 positive passenger inspections” in 2021, according to statistics for the fiscal year released by US Customs and Border Protection, and issued thousands of penalties and violations to travelers who failed to declare prohibited agriculture items.\n\nCBP officials at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston discovered balut eggs in a passenger's luggage on March 6. Balut eggs contain a duck embryo, and are boiled and eaten from the shell. US Customs and Border Protection\n\nFailure to declare food products at US air, sea and land border entry points can lead to fines and penalties of up to $10,000, according to the CBP.\n\nHere’s what you need to know before bringing food products into the US.\n\nWhy are some foods not allowed?\n\nTravelers bringing food products into the US can inadvertently introduce foreign pests and food-borne diseases into the country, which can have a devastating effect on agriculture and the environment. And a pest or disease outbreak could impact more than just farmers. It also means higher grocery bills and shortage of some food items for consumers.\n\nLast year, border officials discovered 264 pests at US ports of entry, a slightly higher number than the 250 found the prior year. Pests intercepted last year include a Saunders 1850 butterfly larvae found in pineapples from Costa Rica. The larvae feeds on plants and legumes, and is considered an invasive pest mainly found in Amazonian tropical rainforest. Introducing it in the US ecosystem could be detrimental to the agriculture industry, the CBP said.\n\n“We work closely with the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Health Inspection Services to prevent the introduction of plant pests and foreign animal diseases,” a CBP spokesperson told CNN.\n\nWhat food products are not allowed into the country?\n\nMost meat, poultry, milk and egg products are either banned or restricted in the US – with rules depending on the country of origin and what livestock diseases are prevalent in the region.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture prohibits animal and bird products from countries with reported cases of livestock diseases such as mad cow, foot-and-mouth, avian flu and swine fever. The USDA provides a link where travelers can check common animal diseases in specific countries.\n\nSometimes, there are gray areas. Pork products from Mexico are banned, for example, but a small amount for personal use – like a ham sandwich – may be allowed at land borders if the meat is thoroughly cooked.\n\nWhat food products can you bring?\n\nA long list of food items are allowed into the US, including condiments, cooking oils, bread, cookies, crackers, cakes, cereal, packed tea and other baked and processed products. The CBP provides a list of allowed items on its website.\n\nJarvis, a beagle, works in the baggage claim area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. He's part of the Beagle Brigade, which works with border officials to sniff out banned food items in luggage. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a catch: If a traveler brings over 50 pounds of an item, it’s considered a commercial shipment and must undergo additional measures, including extra safety inspections. And every agricultural food item has to be declared on US Customs forms, so inspectors can examine them and ensure they do not carry harmful foreign pests or diseases.\n\n“The declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage or in a vehicle,” the CBP’s website notes.\n\nCan you bring in fruits or vegetables?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nNearly all fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are prohibited from entering the US due to risks of pests and diseases – some of which can survive in frigid temperatures, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even the fruits and vegetable snacks provided on an airplane or cruise ship should be left behind, says Lucero Hernandez of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nTravelers crossing a land border into the United States from Canada can bring some fresh fruits and vegetables – as long as they were grown in Canada. But they need proof that the produce is free of soil, pests, and diseases, and that it was grown in Canada, not just sold there, the USDA says.\n\nAnd in all cases, travelers coming to the US should save receipts and original packaging to prove food products’ country of origin, according to the CBP.\n\nWhat happens if you bring forbidden items?\n\nTravelers who declare agricultural products in their luggage don’t face penalties – even if an inspector concludes the items are not eligible to enter the country, the USDA says. In such cases, the food is destroyed.\n\n“An apple or snack that can mistakenly be brought won’t always make a significant incident,” the CBP spokesperson explained of an unintentional failure to declare a food item. “However, attempting to bring in prohibited items would lead to traveler delays and may result in a fine.”\n\n“Failure to declare a prohibited food item may result in the issuance of a civil penalty,” the spokesperson added.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/21/yellow-legged-hornet-nest-found-georgia-murder-hornet/70918203007/", "title": "Second yellow-legged hornet nest found in Wilmington Island, Georgia", "text": "Georgia land management officials are asking residents for help locating an invasive hornet threatening the Peach State's honey production and its No. 1 economic driver: agriculture.\n\nGeorgia Department of Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said officials located a second yellow-legged hornet nest on Wilmington Island near Savannah, while pest experts continue efforts to eradicate the insect, a close relative of the \"murder hornet.\"\n\nThe yellow-legged hornet is a non-native species and, if allowed to flourish in the U.S., could threaten native pollinators, honey production, and agriculture − Georgia's main economic driver, the department wrote in a release issued Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the release, the second nest was discovered Sept. 15, by state staff under a bridge on the island and destroyed that evening by the crew who eradicated the first nest last month.\n\n'A win for the state'\n\nHarper called the destruction a win for the state and said officials are \"working around the clock\" to find additional hornets to kill them.\n\nThe first yellow-legged hornet nest was spotted last month by a Savannah beekeeper who reported the sighting to the state agency.

Also known as Vespa velutina hornets, their nests are generally egg-shaped and can house up to 6,000 worker wasps.\n\nTheir legs are mostly or partially covered in yellow, giving them their name.\n\nHow big are the wasps and where do they originate?\n\nYellow-legged hornets are native to tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia, the GDA reports, athough the insect has also established a presence in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nColonies peak in size in mid to late summer and the hornet is sometimes mistaken for the Northern Giant Hornet, though it is generally smaller than that species. Workers can be as small as half the size of the NGH, whereas queens are a bit larger at 3/4 the size.\n\nMeet Methuselah:The world's oldest known aquarium fish is at least 92, DNA shows\n\n'A deadly predator'\n\nUGA Professor of Entomology and Honey Bee Program Director Keith Delaplane said an ideal scenario includes eradicating all nests before colonies have time to name new queens and breed during winter months.\n\n“While it does not pose a serious risk to humans, pets and livestock, this hornet has proven itself a deadly predator of honey bees and other pollinators,\" Delaplane said.\n\nGeorgians, as well as residents in nearby states including Florida, are being asked to continue report suspected sightings to their state agricultural agency.\n\nWhat to do if you see a yellow-legged hornet:\n\nIf you have spotted a yellow-legged hornet the GDA has a form you can complete.\n\nThe agency advises taking photos of the hornets and comparing their appearance to pictures available on the USDA website, as they can look similar to native species that pose no threat.\n\nThe GDAs asks people to include the following information with form submissions:\n\nName and contact information\n\nLocation and date of the sighting\n\nIf possible, a photograph of the hornet.

It's displacing native tree species and preventing native trees from growing.\"\n\nThe Virginia state forestry department has added the Callery pear to its list of invasive plants – as have several other states. And in April, the department is conducting a tree exchange giving landowners native trees to replace up to three Callery pear trees they've removed.\n\nThis is Virginia's first tree exchange – all the replacement trees are already spoken for, but the department hopes to expand it next year, Chamberlin said. \"But another big part of the program is just making the public aware of Callery pear (trees) and that it actually is invasive,\" she said.\n\nA tree's last days:Stumpy, D.C.'s beloved short cherry tree, to be uprooted after cherry blossoms bloom\n\nWhy are Bradford pear trees and Callery pear trees bad?\n\n“Few trees possess every desired attribute,” The New York Times wrote back in 1964, “but the Bradford ornamental pear comes unusually close to the ideal.”\n\nHow did a tree that seemed perfect to fit into front yards and surround sidewalks branch out to become Public Enemy No. 1 for many state conservationist and forestry officials? Weird science.\n\nThe original Bradford pear tree was ideal for planting because it was thought to be sterile in that it could not reproduce.\n\nPlant breeders continued to tweak Callery pear tree progeny – the Bradford pear tree and other cultivars (or clones) such as Aristocrat, Chanticleer, Cleveland Select and Santa Clara are all part of the Pyrus calleryana (Callery pear) species.\n\nOne reason plant breeders tried new types of Callery pear trees: Bradford trees, which can grow to 20-feet-to-30-feet-tall, are also prone to splitting and breaking, especially in windy weather.\n\nBut somewhere along the line other Callery pear trees and Bradford pear trees cross-pollinated and some began producing viable fruit. Birds and mammals eat the fruit and poop out the seeds, often far from the tree from which it came.\n\nSo that Bradford pear tree in your yard or along Main Street looks innocent – despite the pungent scent its blooms exude to attract pollinators. But the seeds may be spread far and wide by creatures snacking on the fruit (not edible for humans).\n\nThe progeny are creating bigger problems as an invasive species that overwhelms native plants and is hard to eradicate. \"When it was introduced here it did well, a little too well,\" Chamberlin said. \"We're now realizing it is aggressively invading our natural areas.\"\n\nWhy are states banning Callery pear trees?\n\nCallery pear trees grow fast and once they get into a location they can steal nutrients, sun and moisture from native plants. Unlike the Bradford pear trees, these have tough thorns and, as they spread, create dense thickets.\n\n\"They will pop tires so it makes it tricky, when it comes time to harvest timber or getting equipment in for management activities,\" said David Coyle, an assistant professor in Clemson University's Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation.\n\n\"So you've got to get machines with metal tracks on them. These things will also really quickly take over pastures and old fields. So it makes it really hard if you've got livestock.\"\n\nCoyle noticed how the trees had spread in the South from doing research with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service in the early 2000s to becoming a professor at Clemson in 2018.\n\nHe made stopping the spread of the Callery pear trees – and continued sale of the Bradford pear tree – his \"number one priority\" and helped organize Clemson Extension and the South Carolina Forestry Commission's Bradford Pear Bounty program in 2020.\n\nSouth Carolina put the Callery pear tree on its list of state plant pests in 2021 and passed a ban on the sale of Bradford pear trees and any trees grown using the Pyrus calleryana rootstock, effective Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nBradford pear trees: Kansas, Missouri and North Carolina among other states taking action\n\nCallery pears trees can be found in \"the eastern U.S. from New Jersey to Illinois and south to Texas, according to Invasive.org, a joint project of the the University of Georgia's Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture that tracks invasive plants, insects and other pathogens.\n\nStates face different challenges from the species. \"We're not at a tipping point beyond where it's out of control so bad that we can't do anything about it,\" said Ryan Rastok, a forest health coordinator with the Kansas Forest Service.\n\nSeeing how in some other states \"it's much worse, we're using that to say, you know, maybe we need to do something about this,\" Rastok said. \"It's extremely difficult to kill once it's established.\"\n\nHere's what some states are doing to combat Callery pear trees' spread.\n\nWhat can you do about invasive Bradford pear trees?\n\nEven if your state isn't proactively combating Bradford pear trees and Callery pear trees, you can do your part. When it comes time to plant trees choose a native species.\n\n\"Choosing non-invasives can beautify yards without negatively impacting natural habitats and the food webs that depend on them,\" said Angela Sokolowski, invasive species coordinator at the Missouri Department of Conservation. \"Native species will benefit nature the most, as those plants evolved as key components of the natural food chains of pollinators, birds, and other wildlife.\"\n\nMost states have an extension service on line with information about native plants and trees – and invasive species.\n\nMeanwhile, Coyle and other experts are looking at the best ways to destroy the prickly invaders.\n\nSmall saplings can be pulled from the ground. But bigger trees and groupings require cutting the tree down and treatment with herbicide to prevent it from sprouting again – and in some cases burning them down.\n\n\"So it goes from a potential one-step process to a two-step, much more expensive process once they get woody and thorny,\" Coyle said. \"We're trying to figure out timing and efficacy and management practices. Progress takes time.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Visitors to the San Diego Zoo will have the opportunity to see these rare, nocturnal insects in a specialized habitat at the zoo’s Wildlife Explorers Basecamp for the first time in North America, the SD Zoo Alliance announced in a news release. The San Diego Zoo is one of only two zoos outside of Australia and the only zoo in North America to work with this species.\n\n“We are honored to partner with Zoos Victoria on the conservation of the Lord Howe Island stick insect and beyond thrilled to be finally able to share these animals with our guests,” Paige Howorth, director of invertebrate care and conservation, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said in a statement. The zoo's entomology team had collaborated with Australia’s Melbourne Zoo to maintain populations of the critically endangered insect.\n\nHoworth added that the Alliance \"is committed to invertebrate conservation, and bringing our guests close to this rare and iconic species is a great way to raise awareness for the lesser-known animals that run the world.\"\n\nLord Howe Island Stick Insects\n\nNative to the Lord Howe Island Group, a cluster of volcanic islands in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand from where they get the name, the Lord Howe Island stick insect is a large, flightless, nocturnal insect that can grow up to 6 inches in length when fully mature.\n\nThe insects, also known as \"tree lobsters,\" were threatened in their native habitat by invasive plants and non-native predators, including rats, because of which their populations drastically diminished. They were believed to be extinct until a few were rediscovered on a tiny nearby volcanic spire called Ball’s Pyramid in 2001.\n\nTwo pairs of the insects were then taken to the Australian mainland for breeding. One of the pairs was taken to Melbourne Zoo, which has successfully maintained this species in managed care. The species was then brought to San Diego Zoo as part of a partnership between the North America zoo and Zoos Victoria/Melbourne Zoo, which has existed since 2012.\n\nSan Diego Zoo has received insect eggs from Australia on three occasions since 2012, said the Alliance.\n\nBreeding Lord Howe Island Stick Insects\n\nThe stick insects are bred in the McKinney Family Invertebrate Propagation Center, within a dedicated quarantine facility, where temperature and humidity are closely controlled, and UV-transmissible skylights allow access to natural photoperiod cues.\n\nInsect eggs hatch into nymphs, which go through several molting stages for approximately seven months, explains the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.\n\n\"Nymphs are bright green for the first few months of life. As they mature, they begin to darken to greenish-brown and seek shelter during daylight,\" said the news release. \"Adults are a dark, glossy brown-black, and are strictly herbivorous, foraging at night on host plants and resting in tree hollows and other retreats during the day.\"\n\nTo ensure the insects' survival, members of the Zoo's horticulture team also traveled to Australia to collect seeds and cuttings of important host plants for young stick insects that were unavailable in North America, said the Alliance. Adult stick insects have different host plant preferences and the zoo's horticulture team maintains plant material to support the insect population throughout all their life stages.\n\n'In shock':Mississippi hunter bags dwarf deer with record-sized antlers\n\n'Alone and malnourished':Orphaned sea otter gets a new home at Chicago's Shedd Aquarium\n\nEfforts are also being made to return the insect back to its ancestral home and an unprecedented rat eradication effort was implemented in 2019 to rid the island of the predators. This resulted in an “ecological renaissance” on the island, said the SDWZ Alliance, in which many other rare or presumed extinct plant and animal species that fell prey to rats, reemerged.\n\nThe Lord Howe Island stick insects are on display at in the Tree Hollow area of Spineless Marvels, Level 1 at the San Diego Zoo. They are kept within a reversed light cycle so that guests can view them during the day under red light, which is invisible to the insects and simulates night, their active time.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

The specially trained dog keeps its snout to the ground, rooting through more than 1.6 square miles (4.1 square kilometers) of underbrush, searching for nests of Argentine ants that threatened the ecosystem after they were introduced decades ago.\n\nChristina Boser, an ecologist with the Nature Conservancy group, said Tuesday that Tobias has not yet discovered any new ant populations — a sign that a project started in 2009 to wipe out the unwanted insects has probably worked.\n\n\"The ants are very hard to find,\" said Boser, adding that researchers decided to try a detection dog after first using lures made with a synthetic ant pheromone. \"He's good at his job, and he enjoys it a lot.\"\n\nResearchers speculate the ants arrived in the Channel Islands more than 30 years ago when boats used by contractors did work there.\n\nBoser researchers have not destroyed several old nests to make sure Tobias has something to sniff out so he can get his work reward: A favorite ball.\n\nArgentine ants found in the country and in other South American nations have crossed borders and bedeviled homeowners and farmers along the U.S. West Coast for decades.\n\nIn a protected environment like Santa Cruz Island, part of Channel Islands National Park, the tiny pests aggressively compete with local ants for nectar, Boser said. Ultimately they can prevent bees from pollinating flowers — stopping seed production and killing off plant species, she said.\n\nStarting seven years ago, teams began using helicopters to distribute beads containing a low dose of pesticide mixed with sugar water across infested areas of the islands northwest of Los Angeles. Seduced by the sweetness, foraging worker ants gobbled up the bait and headed back to their nests, where they poisoned ant queens. Without queens, the colonies eventually died off.\n\n\"We're now at the point that we're going back in there to see if it worked,\" Boser said.\n\nThe fact that Tobias' searches are coming up empty gives scientists hope, she said, but it will take further study of long-term data for them to declare the ants \"functionally eradicated.\"\n\nTobias, owned by the Working Dogs For Conservation group, previously sniffed out invasive quagga mussels at a lake in Montana.\n\nWhen the stint on Santa Cruz Island ends, the dog will eventually be dispatched for the same ant-sniffing job on San Clemente Island, the southernmost link in the Channel Islands chain.\n\n\"We're happy to keep him working, and he's happy to do it,\" Boser said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christopher Weber at http://twitter.com/webercm.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/07"}]}

All-Stars Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have all missed significant time with injuries for the Sixers, who were predicted to be Eastern Conference contenders but currently sit at 5-14 at 14th among the 15 teams in the Eastern Conference. The Pelicans have also been hit by injuries to All-Stars Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram among others and are 4-18 with nine straight losses. The Pacers lost their first game to the 76ers in October and also lost to New Orleans on Nov. 1, but they won their second game against the Pelicans on Nov. 25.\n\nThe Pacers are 9-13 and have lost three straight.\n\nAll things Pacers: Latest Indiana Pacers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2024/12/17/bucks-thunder-predictions-odds-nba-cup-final-2024/77027834007/", "title": "Bucks vs. Thunder: Predictions, odds for NBA Cup final", "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder and Milwaukee Bucks are competing for the second annual NBA Cup tonight.

Bickerstaff expressed excitement for the team to be able to learn lessons from such an atmosphere — the closest a regular-season game can get to emulating the postseason.\n\n“(It’s) understanding possessions matter more, turnovers matter more, rebounds, execution, all those things matter more in meaningful basketball games,” Bickerstaff said. “So this is a great opportunity for our guys to experience that against a really good basketball team who's been through a lot of those games. So it'll be a great test for us to see where we are and how we learned from what happened versus Houston (on Sunday) to tonight, because you'll see a similar style.”\n\nThe game — a thrilling, messy and bizarre 123-121 overtime win over the Miami Heat — provided plenty of lessons and ultimately was another sign that the Pistons, now 5-7 overall, are figuring some things out.\n\nTHE GAME:Detroit Pistons beat Miami Heat, 123-121, thanks to Chris Webber-technical in last second\n\nAll things Pistons: Latest Detroit Pistons news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThey led by 18 in the first half and by nine with just under two minutes left in the fourth. Tyler Herro proceeded to send the game into overtime, knocking down three 3-pointers en route to a 40-point night. Both sides committed mistakes in the extra period, but the Pistons did two things they’ve long struggled to do — stay more composed than the opposing team and, well, win the game.\n\n“As a whole group, we deserved to get that win,” Tobias Harris said. “We kinda gave it away there in the fourth quarter, the end of it, but that’s something that we have to learn from, with the leads that we’ve been having, how to sustain those leads and take care of the basketball and be able to come out with a clean victory. You take any win in this league and that was a big one for us.\n\nThe Pistons opened overtime with three consecutive turnovers and trailed by three, 119-116, before Malik Beasley tied the game with a 3 with 40.9 seconds left. Herro made Miami’s final shot of the night, a hook over Beasley, with 1.9 seconds left. The Pistons tied the game at 121 in the final second, when Cunningham tossed Duren an inbounds lob for an alley-oop dunk — executing the set exactly how the coaching staff drew it up.\n\nAs mistake-prone as the Pistons were late, the biggest blunder of the night belonged to the Heat. Head coach Erik Spoelstra called a timeout they didn’t have following Duren’s dunk, leading to a technical foul and a one-point Pistons lead after Beasley knocked down the ensuing free throw. The Heat also briefly had six players on the floor, turning the ball — and the game — over to the Pistons.\n\nBickerstaff’s pregame words were prophetic. Turnovers mattered more, and nearly cost them the game. But the Pistons recovered with clutch shot-making and defense, holding the Heat to 4-for-11 shooting in overtime. And they got their first NBA Cup tournament win after going 0-4 last year amid a 28-game losing streak.\n\n“That’s what it was going to take and that’s how you win in this league,” Bickerstaff said. “We impressed upon our guys the importance of this game. We wanted it to be meaningful for them. To give us experience in what things may hold in the future, to make sure that we understand what it takes to win those types of meaningful basketball games, and to get stops is the only way you’re going to be able to do it and do it consistently.\n\n“We won, so we passed the test,” he continued. “We figured out a way, sometimes around ourselves, but we did enough to come away with the win. I’ll give our effort an 'A,' execution and things like that we can always improve on. But I thought we made enough plays down the stretch to help us win.”\n\nThe Pistons committed eight turnovers through the first three quarters, but outdid themselves with 11 in the fourth quarter and overtime combined. Cade Cunningham was responsible for five of the 11, including one with 21 seconds left in the fourth that gave the Heat the final possession of the period, and four more in overtime.\n\nStill, they managed to do just enough to win. Cunningham’s final turnover of the night with 17 seconds left set up Herro’s almost-winner on the other end, but the Pistons guard's assist to Duren ended up saving the night.\n\n“The physicality went up, they started denying everything,” Cunningham said of the turnovers. “That was the main thing. We stopped spacing the floor as well, we clogged it up and allowed them to be physical and allowed them to crowd the ball, and we gave the ball away, and yeah.\n\n“It was hectic. We feel great about that one. That’s a huge win. It’s a really good team, great coach over there. He always has them prepared and stuff. To come out with that win, Tim went down, to be able to grind that one out means a lot to everyone.”\n\nFollowing the win, the Pistons are tied for seventh in the Eastern Conference and have the same number of wins as the No. 4 seed Indiana Pacers, who are 5-5. There’s a lot of season remaining, but they Pistons are on pace to win 34 games — a significant jump from the franchise-worst 14 wins they finished with last season.\n\n“It’s been fun, that’s all I can really say,” Duren said. “It’s been super fun since the start, since preseason. Getting to know these guys, growing with these guys, even the guys that have been here, growing with them and continuing to get better and learn each other, it’s been great. We’ve been through a lot. For us to get some momentum is huge.”\n\nContact Omari Sankofa II at osankofa@freepress.com.

But it still belongs to the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. and its loaded roster filled with MVPs, All-Stars and NBA champions proved that once again, defeating France 98-87 in for the Olympic gold medal Saturday at Bercy Arena.\n\nSorry France and Victor Wembanyama. Sorry Serbia and Nikola Jokic. You too, Germany and Franz Wagner and Canada and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. It’s not your time for gold. Not yet. Maybe at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Maybe.\n\nBut not now.\n\nUSA women win eighth consecutive 4x400 gold\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Gabby Thomas is leaving the 2024 Olympics with the best kind of souvenir: gold.\n\nGold medals, to be specific. Three of them.\n\nThomas picked up her third in the finale of Olympic track and field Saturday at Stade de France in the women’s 4x400 relay, as the Americans clocked an American record 3:15.27 to smoke the Netherlands (3:19.50) and Great Britain (3:19.72).\n\nThomas ran the third leg, taking the baton from Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and handing off to Alexis Holmes for the anchor. Thomas ran a 49.30 split.\n\nShamier Little, the only athlete from the final who’d also run in prelims, got the U.S. started in the race.\n\nAmerican Shelby McEwen wins silver in men’s high jump\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — In a jump off, Hamish Kerr of New Zealand won gold in the men’s high jump while Shelby McEwen of the U.S. took silver. It is the first high jump medal for the U.S. since 2012.\n\nQatar’s Mutaz Barshim, who shared gold in Tokyo with Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy, claimed the bronze.\n\nThe competition came down to Kerr and McEwen after both cleared 2.36 meters (7 feet, 8 3/4), but neither could get over 2.38. They agreed to a jump off and started lowering the bar. Both cleared 2.36 again but on 2.34, McEwen missed while Kerr got over. When he cleared the bar, Kerr went running onto the empty field, his arms stretched out in victory.\n\nMcEwen’s first 2.36 clearance was a personal best for him. He got over on his first attempt, and was the first jumper to clear that height. He laid on the high jump bit after getting over the bar, his ecstasy as obvious as his gold spikes.\n\nThe event had plenty of drama.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Tamberi posted on social media that he was headed to the ER after vomiting blood and dealing with severe kidney pain. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to compete in the final, but rallied and cleared 2.22 meters (7 feet, 3 1/4 inches) on his third attempt before failing to clear 2.27 (7 feet, 5 1/4 inches).\n\nU.S. men win 4x400 relay gold in Olympic record time\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France – Rai Benjamin confidently told USA TODAY Sports that the U.S. men’s 4x400-relay team “got something for” their competition in the final. Benjamin was correct.\n\nBenjamin led the U.S. 4x400-relay team to a victory at Stade de France. The men's team consisted of Chris Bailey, Vernon Norwood, Bryce Deadmon and Benjamin at anchor.\n\nNorwood got the team in position running the second leg, Deadmon got the squad a two-meter lead on the third leg and Benjamin took the gold home with a Olympic record time of 2:54.43. Botswana earned the silver with a time of 2:54.53 and Great Britain rounded out the top three, clocking in at 2:55.83.\n\nThe gold capped off a superb Paris Olympics for both Benjamin and Hall, who each of two gold medals apiece at these Games. Benjamin won his first Olympic gold medal in the men’s 400 hurdles. While Hall dug deep and rallied back to win gold in the open 400. — Tyler Dragon\n\nKenya runner breaks Olympic record, wins gold in women's 1,500\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Kenya's Faith Kipyegon won the gold medal and set a new Olympic standard in the women's 1,500-meter race Saturday at the Paris Games clocking an Olympic record time of 3:51.29 at Stade de France. Kipyegon outpaced Australia's Jessica Hull, who took silver in 3:52.56, and Great Britain's Georgia Bell, who got bronze with a time of 3:52.61.\n\nTwo competitors for Team USA, Nikki Hiltz (3:56.38) and Elle St. Pierre (3:57.52) finished seventh and eighth, respectively, out of 12. — Chase Goodbread\n\nGrant Fisher earns another bronze in men's 5,000m\n\nIn some much-needed redemption after disaster in the 1,500, Norway’s Jakob Ingerbrigtsen used a killer kick to win the men’s 5,000, running a season best 13:13.66. He outlasted Kenya’s Ronald Kwemoi (13:15.04) who finished second. American Grant Fisher won his second bronze of the Games, finishing third at 13:15.13.\n\nFisher finished third in the men’s 10,000 on the first day of track and field at the 2024 Olympics, earning the U.S.’s first medal in that event since the 2012 London Games. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nKennedy Blades reaches gold medal match\n\nKennedy Blades has put on a show during the first three matches of her run at the Paris Olympics, going 3-0 and outscoring her opponents 23-9 to reach Sunday's gold-medal match. Awaiting her there will be the winner of Columbia's Tatiana Renteria vs. Japan's Yuka Kagami.\n\nBlades recently transferred to Iowa and hasn't even worn a Hawkeye singlet yet. But she's already Iowa women's wrestling's first Olympian and Olympic medalist. — Eli McKown, Hawk Central\n\nAlyssa Naeher unflappable for USWNT in gold medal match win\n\nPARIS — Alyssa Naeher might as well change the nickname on her Wikipedia page to \"Captain America\" or \"Secretary of Defense\" herself.\n\nThe USWNT goalkeeper's one-handed stop – like a basketball defender blocking someone at the rim – on a header from Brazil’s Adriana in the fourth minute of stoppage time saved the day and preserved the Americans' 1-0 win in the Olympic gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Games. Minutes later, her teammates pounced on her after the referee blew the final whistle, ending more than 10 minutes of stoppage time.\n\nNaeher was unflappable all match. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nMasai Russell wins women's 100 hurdles in photo finish\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Masai Russell beat the defending Olympic champion in the 100 hurdles.\n\nRussell outdueled Puerto Rico’s Jasmine Camacho-Quinn to win her first Olympic gold medal. She ran a time of 12.33 to earn the gold.\n\nFrance’s Cyréna Samba-Mayela ran a 12.34 to place second and Camacho-Quinn crossed the line at 12.36 to come in third in the photo finish.\n\nCamacho-Quinn got a great start out of the blocks, but Russell pulled even with her and slightly surpassed her at the ninth hurdle and held off the other hurdlers for the victory.\n\nRussell’s had an impressive climb to the top of the hurdles. She didn’t finish the 100 hurdles semifinal at the 2023 world championships. But 2024 has been her year. She won the event at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials with a personal-best and world-leading time of 12.25, the fourth fastest time in history. And she capped off the year as an Olympic champion.\n\nTeam USA has won gold in four of the past six Olympics in the 100 hurdles. — Tyler Dragon\n\nJordan Chiles might have to return bronze medal\n\nPARIS — The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled Saturday that the judging panel at the women's floor exercise final improperly granted an inquiry that increased U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles' score and moved her into bronze medal position. The Swiss-based court ruled that the appeal was submitted past the one-minute deadline for inquiries and therefore should not have been granted.\n\nAs a result, it said, Chiles should have received a score of 13.666 in the event – which would've placed her fifth, just shy of the Olympic podium.\n\nCAS said in a statement that its ruling applied to Chiles' score but not the final ranking. — Tom Schad\n\nBryce Hoppel places 4th in 800m, but nets national record\n\nSAINT-DENIS, France — Team USA's Bryce Hoppel just missed a spot on the podium Saturday in the 800-meter race at the Paris Games, running a time of 1:41.67, but he did record a national record despite a fourth-place finish. Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonwi took gold in 1:41.19, followed by Canada's Marco Arop (silver, 1:41.20) and Algeria's Djamel Sedjati (bronze, 1:41.50).\n\nThe previous U.S. record in the 800 was held by Donavan Brazier (1:42.34).\n\nOn the final night of competition at Stade de France, Hoppel held third place halfway through the race, but could not close well enough to medal in an event in which Team USA has had only sparse success; only three medals in the last 40 years. Team USA's last medal in the 800m race came at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, a bronze by Clayton Murphy. The two others in that span were by Earl Jones (bronze, Los Angeles, 1984) and Johnny Gray (bronze, Barcelona, 1992).\n\nHoppel qualified for the Tokyo Games in the 800m three years ago, but did not advance past the semifinals. — Chase Goodbread\n\nUSWNT wins first gold since 2012\n\nPARIS — The United States women’s national soccer team defeated Brazil, 1-0, on Saturday to win the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Games. Mallory Swanson scored in the 57th minute, her fourth goal of these Games, to lead the Americans to their first gold medal since 2012 and their fifth overall.\n\nThroughout these Olympic Games, the Americans have been led by the trio of Swanson, Trinity Rodman and Sophia Smith while defender Naomi Girma has been something of a brick wall on the backline. In the gold medal match, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher was unflappable, coming up with clutch saves throughout the game. All of this orchestrated by new head coach Emma Hayes, whose sense of humor and demanding style has built trust with the players and struck the right balance for this roster.\n\nUSWNT takes lead on goal by Mallory Swanson\n\nMallory Swanson gave the United States a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute on a signature run down the left side. Korbin Albert, starting in place of Rose Lavelle, delivered the through ball for either Sophia Smith or Swanson. Smith would have likely been ruled offside if she touched it. But Swanson swooped in and made a beeline for the net, and her right-footed blast beat Brazil’s keeper Lorena to break the scoreless tie.\n\nFrance men defend Olympic title in volleyball\n\nFrance beat Poland in straight sets, 25-19, 25-20, 25-23, to win its second consecutive gold medal in men's volleyball.\n\nThe crowd began chanting 'Allez Les Bleus' and the national anthem as the third set wound down.\n\nTeam USA won bronze by beating Italy on Friday.\n\nTeam USA's B-boy Victor, B-boy Jeffro advance to medal round\n\nBoth of the two Americans in the men's Olympic breaking competition will move on to the knockout round.\n\nB-boy Jeffro, whose real name is Jeffrey Louis, had mathematically clinched his spot in the quarterfinals even before he went out for his third battle. He won each of his first two battles handily and earned 30 of the possible 36 votes from the nine-person judging panel in the process.\n\nB-boy Victor, whose full name is Victor Montalvo, appeared to draw one of the tougher groups in the round-robin stage but tore through his first three opponents with relative ease – winning five of his six rounds, including sweeps of Japanese breaker Hiro10 and B-boy Lithe-ing of China. Shigekix of Japan was the other breaker to advance out of Victor's group. — Tom Schad\n\nUSWNT-Brazil in scoreless tie at halftime\n\nFor the United States women's soccer team, the first half of both the quarterfinals and semifinals were scoreless (and all of regulation, for that matter). The final against Brazil was no exception.\n\nBoth teams had their fair share of scoring chances – Brazil’s more consistent compared to the Americans – but neither side had anything to show for it.\n\nBrazil’s Ludmila has been a handful for the U.S. back line to deal with. It looked like she put Brazil up in the 16th minute when she beat Naomi Girma off the dribble in the box, but luckily for the U.S., the offside flag went up. Alyssa Naeher came up huge during stoppage time to save a Gabi Porthilo strike.\n\nMallory Swanson had the United States’ best chance of scoring on a long, speedy run with the ball.\n\nWhat to expect from LA28\n\nPARIS — After the Paris Olympics conclude Sunday, the Paralympics will run Aug. 28 to Sept. 8, then the squash racket, lacrosse stick and cricket ball – all sporting additions to the 2028 Games – will be in Los Angeles' court.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and and LA28 Olympic Games chair Casey Wasserman, who are in Paris as part of a U.S. presidential delegation to the Olympics that was led by First Lady Jill Biden, provided a few details Saturday to reporters about what sports fans – and Angelenos – can expect to see four years from now.\n\n\"We don't have an Eiffel Tower. We do have a Hollywood sign,\" said Wasserman. He said that while the Paris Games have been \"authentically French\" the 2028 Games will be \"authentically Los Angeles.\"\n\nRead more from Kim Hjelmgaard.\n\nLydia Ko wins gold medal in women's golf\n\nSAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France – New Zealand's Lydia Ko completed her Olympic trifecta on Saturday, adding a gold medal to her silver from Rio and bronze from Tokyo.\n\nAt 10 under par for the event, Ko shot a 1 under 71 on Saturday to hold on and win the Olympic golf tournament at Le Golf National by two strokes over silver medalist Esther Henseleit of Germany (8 under) and bronze medalist Lin Xiyu of China (7 under).\n\nIt was a disappointing finish for a trio of American players. World No. 1 Nelly Korda, Rose Zhang and Lilia Vu each shot over-par rounds Saturday, with Zhang (5 under) and Tokyo gold medalist Korda (1 under) each stumbling to miss the medals after starting the final day in contention. — Gentry Estes\n\nUSWNT goes for gold\n\nThe United States women’s national team takes on Brazil, aiming to win its first gold medal since 2012, which is also the last time they made the final.\n\nThey have been led by the trio of Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman and Sophia Smith, who have scored three goals apiece at these Games, while defender Naomi Girma has been something of a brick wall on the backline.\n\nFollow along for live updates, highlights and analysis throughout the match.\n\nLydia Ko opens up five-shot lead in women's golf tournament\n\nLydia Ko of New Zealand is 2-under par after 11 holes during Saturday's final round, giving her an overall score of 11 under for Paris. That's five shots better than her closest competitors.\n\nNelly Korda is the closest American at 4 under overall. Rose Zhang, who started Saturday at 7 under, is 4 over on the day and has dropped into a tie for 11th place at 3 under.\n\nB-Boys breaking begins Saturday\n\nThe breaking competition continues Saturday at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the B-Boys taking center stage.\n\nThe competition starts with a round-robin tournament, four groups of four breakers, with each one going two rounds against the other three in their group. From there, the top two B-Boys in each group – as determined by who won the most rounds – advance to the quarterfinals. The quarters, semis and finals are three rounds in a traditional bracket style.\n\nFollow for live updates, scores and highlights throughout the competition. — Tom Schad\n\nNevin Harrison nearly notches gold in canoe sprint\n\nVAIRES-SUR-MARNE, France — Nevin Harrison came 1/100th of a second away from winning her second gold medal.\n\nHarrison took the silver medal in the women’s 200-meter canoe sprint Saturday, losing to Canada’s Katie Vincent in a photo finish.\n\nVincent finished the course in a world-record tie of 44.12 seconds, a hair ahead of Harrison (44.13). Cuba's Yarisleidis Cirilo Duboys (44.36) took bronze.\n\nHarrison set an Olympic record on her way to winning gold at the Tokyo Olympics as an 18-year-old. She finished second in her semifinal heat, 29/100ths of a second behind Vincent.\n\nVincent won a bronze earlier in the games as part of Canada’s 500-meter canoe doubles team. — Dave Birkett\n\nAmerican climber wins first Olympic medal\n\nLE BOURGET, France — American sport climber Brooke Raboutou claimed her first Olympic medal Saturday, winning silver in the women’s boulder and lead combined final, finishing behind Slovenian favorite and gold medalist Janja Garnbret. Garnbret led the way with 168.5 total points, followed by Raboutou with 156.0 and Austria’s Jessica Pilz with 147.4 points for bronze.Raboutou – a 23-year-old two-time Olympian – built off a strong performance in the boulder final, finishing that portion with 84 points, just .4 points behind Garnbret, 25. Raboutou and Garnbret were the only climbers to top three of the four boulder problems, finishing the round second and first, respectively. In the lead portion, Raboutou had another standout performance, collecting 72 points, moving to the top of the leaderboard and guaranteeing herself a medal. Garnbret previously won Olympic gold at the 2021 Tokyo Games in the women’s combined – a different format compared with the Paris Olympics when the combined event featured boulder, lead and speed. Raboutou finished fifth in the event in Tokyo. ― Michelle Martinelli\n\nSerbia wins bronze in men's basketball\n\nSerbia men’s 5x5 basketball team captured the bronze medal with a 93-83 victory over Germany on Saturday. Serbia rebounded from a heartbreaking 95-91 loss to the U.S. in the semifinals and prevented Germany from earning its first Olympic medal in men’s 5x5.\n\nSerbia’s three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic had 19 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, and teammate Vasilije Micic scored 19 points. Bogdan Bogdanovic added 16 points for Serbia, which earned silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics and 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nIt was a disappointing finish for Germany, the 2023 FIBA World Cup champion, which went 3-0 in group play but lost to France in the semifinals and Serbia in the third-place game.\n\nFranz Wagner led Germany with 18 points and nine rebounds. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nEthiopia's Tamirat Tola wins gold in men's marathon\n\nTamirat Tola of Ethiopia took the gold medal in the men's marathon Saturday morning, setting a new Olympic record with a time of 2:06.26, and blowing away the chase group by more than 20 seconds to earn his second Olympic medal.

Each conference has three groups. Those groups were drawn after the NBA put teams into five separate pools based on their finish in last season’s standings: Pool 1 including the top three seeds by record last season all the way down to Pool 5 which had the three worst teams in the standings from a season ago.\n\nThe Cavs wound up in Grouping C in the Eastern Conference. Here’s a look at the groupings:\n\nEast A: New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets, Charlotte HornetsEast B: Milwaukee Bucks, Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors, Detroit PistonsEast C: Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Atlanta Hawks, Chicago Bulls, Washington Wizards\n\nWest A: Minnesota Timberwolves, LA Clippers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail BlazersWest B: Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers, Utah Jazz, San Antonio SpursWest C: Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks, New Orleans Pelicans, Golden State Warriors, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nWhat is the NBA Cup format?\n\nWith all the teams split into their respective groupings, each team will play one game against the other four teams in their group.\n\nThe winner of each group, along with the team that had the best record among non-group winners, advances to the knockout rounds, ultimately crowning an NBA Cup champ with the title game on Dec. 17.\n\nWhat do players get for winning the NBA Cup?\n\nLast year, the players on the winning team (the Lakers) received $500,000 each. Runners-up received $200,000 each. The players who lost in the semifinals each got $100,000, and the losing teams players from the quarterfinals each got $50,000.\n\nWhile that may seem like a drop in the bucket to the league’s highest-paid stars, it’s a big cash prize to young players and role players whose salaries aren't as gargantuan by comparison.\n\nAccording to ESPN, the cash prizes will be slightly higher this season dude to negotiated year-over-year raises as part of the most recent collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association.\n\nThe winning team also claims the NBA Cup trophy.\n\nWhy is it called the Emirates NBA Cup?\n\nThe NBA Cup now has Emirates branding stemming from a sponsorship deal the NBA struck with Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, to sponsor the tournament following its introduction a season ago.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2023/12/09/lakers-win-nba-cup-in-season-tournament-winners-losers/71869325007/", "title": "Winners and losers of first NBA In-Season Tournament: Lakers ...", "text": "Add two more lines to LeBron James’ Basketball Hall of Fame resume.\n\nNBA Cup championship.\n\nNBA In-Season Tournament MVP.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers superstar scored 24 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, delivered four assists and had two steals as the Lakers defeated Indiana 123-109 Saturday in the championship game of the NBA’s first In-Season Tournament.\n\nLakers forward-center Anthony Davis delivered an exceptional and necessary performance: 41 points, 20 rebounds, five assists and four blocks, and reserve guard Austin Reaves scored 28 points, including 22 points in 12 minutes, 36 seconds in the first half.\n\nThe Lakers were 7-0 in the In-Season Tournament.\n\nThe upstart Pacers, who have the league’s best offense and a star-in-the-making in Tyrese Haliburton, were impressive, winning their first six games of the IST. But they struggled offensively against the Lakers. Haliburton had 20 points and 11 assists but was 2-for-8 on 3-pointers and the Pacers shot 36.8% from the field and 24.4% on 3s.\n\nLet’s take a look at the winners and losers of the NBA In-Season Tournament:\n\nWinners\n\nNBA\n\nThe idea of an in-season tournament was met with apprehension, if not skepticism, from a wide range of people inside and outside of the league. But there was also intrigue, and by the time the IST reached the final night of group play, there was sufficient interest.\n\nAnd that interest showed up in increased TV ratings and record attendance in November, which is important for the league as it negotiates a new TV deal after the current one expires after 2024-25.\n\nTop players were on the court for IST games, which in general were competitive and stars performed.\n\n“I want to thank all of the players in the league and the coaches, of course, the teams, for embracing this new concept. I know it doesn’t come without challenges,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “There’s no doubt there’s some things that we are learning this time through. I mean, overall, we are thrilled with the interest we’ve seen so far this season. But again, probably people are tired of hearing the word 'tweak.' So we’ll come up with another synonym for that.\"\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nJames wanted to win this, and if you thought earning an extra $500,000 per player for winning the NBA Cup didn’t matter to him, you haven’t paid attention to his approach. James averaged 26.4 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 1.6 steals and shot 56.8% from the field and 60.6% on 3-pointers.\n\nJames’ MVP days are behind him, but he remains – just shy of his 39th birthday on Dec. 30 – one of the game’s best and most impactful players.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers, Indiana Pacers\n\nBeyond winning the NBA Cup, each Lakers player earned $500,00 for capturing the title. Los Angeles is 14-9 and in a virtual three-way tie for third place in the Western Conference.\n\nEach Pacers player earned $250,000 for reaching the final, and this run was an important step in the development of the Pacers, who have the potential to be a significant factor in the Eastern Conference this season and beyond.\n\nThe major question for both teams: How can they use this experience to maximize success moving forward?\n\nIndiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton\n\nHaliburton began emerging as a franchise-caliber player last season and has solidified that status this season, especially during the IST when he averaged 26-plus points and 10-plus assists and shot better than 50% from the field and better than 44% on 3-pointers, leading the Pacers to the final.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward-center Anthony Davis\n\nAnthony Davis started the game 6-for-6 and had 13 points and eight rebounds in the first quarter. The Pacers, who struggle defensively, had no answer for Davis, who averaged 23.2 points (52.5% shooting from the field), 14.6 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.9 blocks in the IST.\n\nMilwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo-Damian Lillard combo\n\nThe Bucks are still trying to figure out the game as a team (see below), but stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard provide the dynamic expected when the Bucks made the trade for Lillard. The Bucks scored 127 points per 100 possessions when they were on the court in the IST. Antetokounmpo averaged 29 points and 5.8 assists and shot 64.6% from the field and 71.4% on limited 3-point attempts, and Lillard averaged 28.7 points, 7.0 assists and 4.8 rebounds and shot 50% from the field and 51.1% on 3s.\n\nStars came to play\n\nOf the players who played in at least four IST games, these averaged at least 25 points and shot at least 50% from the field: Antetokounmpo, Lillard, Haliburton, James, Phoenix’s Kevin Durant, Dallas’ Luka Doncic, Denver’s Nikola Jokic, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Boston's Jaylen Brown, Utah’s Jordan Clarkson.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nLas Vegas is a popular NBA destination – namely for the Summer League, which draws more than 100,000 fans. The NBA capped its IST with the semifinals and final in Vegas, and as expansion is a real possibility after a new TV deal is in place, the Nevada city will be at the top of the list for expansion, along with Seattle, if and when the NBA decides to go in that direction.\n\nLas Vegas has a WNBA team (Aces), NFL team (Raiders), NHL team (Golden Knights) and will get an MLB team (Oakland A’s).\n\nT-Mobile Arena, where the IST semis and final were played, is an NBA-ready facility, and an expansion fee will net the league billions of dollars.\n\nLeBron James has expressed an interest in being part of an ownership group for a Vegas franchise, and double-downed on that desire after the game.\n\n“My enthusiasm about being here post-career, bringing a team here has not changed,” James said. “The fans are amazing here. They have everything already – WNBA team, they have a baseball team coming in soon, NFL team, hockey team, F1 was just here over the Thanksgiving week. Everything is here. This is a place that loves great attractions and I think the NBA will be another great addition to this city.”\n\nWhen Silver presented James with the MVP award, the commissioner joked with the star, \"Sorry, this doesn't come with a franchise.\"\n\nLosers\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nThe Bucks lost in the IST semifinals, and the report from Chris Haynes detailing Bobby Portis' postgame challenge to first-year coach Adrian Griffin and Giannis Antetokounmpo’s comment that the Bucks are sometimes “not organized at all” signify not all is right with the 15-7 squad.\n\n0-4 In-Season Tournament teams\n\nDetroit Pistons: The Pistons were 0-4 in group play – all losses part of a 19-game losing streak that could reach 20 games when they play the Pacers Monday.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: The Spurs have lost 16 consecutive games – and are thankful for the Pistons.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: It has been a problematic season for the Grizzlies, who are 6-15 overall and still two weeks from Ja Morant’s return from a 25-game suspension.\n\nChicago Bulls: The Bulls attempted a quick turnaround, but it’s not working – time for the Bulls to see what they can get in trades for their key players.\n\nWashington Wizards: The Wizards allowed at least 120 points in each group play game.\n\nBoston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum\n\nThe Celtics star shot just 43.3% from the field and 22% on 3-pointers in Boston’s five IST games, including 1-for-11 against Toronto, 0-for-3 against Orlando and 2-for-8 against Indiana.\n\nSoutheast and Northwest divisions\n\nNone of the 10 teams from the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference and Northwest Division from the Western Conference made it out of group play, including Orlando, Miami, Minnesota, Oklahoma City and Denver – all teams with winning records (and the Timberwolves with a league-best 17 victories).\n\nLos Angeles Clippers’ James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard\n\nThe Clippers were 1-3 in the IST, Paul George shot 32.5% on 3s, Russell Westbrook shot 30% from the field, and of George, Westbrook, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, only Harden had a positive plus-minus in those games. Now, overall, they have won three consecutive games, are 11-10 and have room to improve.\n\n***\n\nLakers vs Pacers highlights", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/11/usa-basketballs-olympic-depth-win-vs-canada/74362239007/", "title": "USA Basketball's Olympic depth on display in win vs. Canada", "text": "LAS VEGAS – Calling the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball reserves a second unit is misnomer or at least misleading.\n\nWhen U.S. coach Steve Kerr takes out LeBron James, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Devin Booker and Joel Embiid and puts into the game Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo, it’s essentially five NBA All-Stars replacing five NBA All-Stars.\n\nCanada, a 2024 Paris Olympics medal contender and fielding its best Olympic team, felt the onslaught of that depth in the USA’s 86-72 victory in an exhibition game Wednesday in preparation of the Summer Games.\n\nFour Americans scored in double-figures led by Edwards’ 13 points and Davis’ 10 points, 11 rebounds, four blocked shots and two steals.\n\nThe U.S. wasn’t perfect, but that wasn’t expected after just four days of practice with this 12-player roster. Still, Canada's Olympics team features many of the players who were on the team that beat the U.S. in last year’s FIBA World Cup bronze-medal game.\n\nIt was a solid start to the U.S. exhibition schedule which includes games against Australia, Serbia, South Sudan and Germany.\n\n\"You kind of can't go wrong picking a starting lineup with this group, and I think I told you guys the other day, I'm going to do something different the next two games,\" Kerr said. \"We're going to just look at a few different combinations before we settle on anything.\"\n\nBreaking down the U.S. victory over Canada:\n\nUSA’s superior depth\n\nYou will hear over and over how the rest of the world has caught up with the U.S. in basketball. And individually, there’s a case to be made with three players born outside of the U.S. winning the past six regular-season MVPs.\n\nHowever, when the U.S. assembles its best players, it is the favorite to win gold as it has in the past four Olympics. No other country can match the U.S. depth. Serbia has three-time MVP Nikola Jokic and Greece has two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, but no country has what the U.S. has talent-wise (player one through player 12) for this Olympics.\n\nAfter the U.S. fell behind early, including 11-1, the second five eliminated that deficit and helped build a 28-23 lead. The U.S. led the rest of the game.\n\n\"I love the second group and the defense picking up the pace for us in transition,\" Kerr said. \"They made a few good plays there defensively to really kind of jump-start our offense and that got us into the game.\"\n\nJames, Embiid and Curry were outscored when on the court, but the U.S. bench outscored Canada’s 42-27.\n\n\"You get this collection of guys together and it is a test and it's a challenge to try to figure out – just the chemistry, just the flow and the rhythm, especially on offense because there's a temptation to defer,\" Curry said. \"There's a temptation to overthink every possession because everybody can make a play and when you have an advantage, you just try to keep the game as simple as possible.\n\n\"That first unit, we struggled with that, but then once we got settled in, it seemed like everybody got a little bit more comfortable as we got deeper into the game and hopefully the next four exhibition games we have to see more progress.\"\n\nUS uses size advantage vs. Canada\n\nWhen the U.S. failed to medal at the FIBA World Cup last year, its lack of size at the center and power forward spots were exposed.\n\nThat’s not the case this year with Embiid, Davis and Adebayo. The final rebounding total (53-48) was not indicative of how the U.S. controlled that category – it had a 39-23 edge headed into the fourth quarter. Davis was dominant on the glass, and James, Embiid and Holiday each had at least five rebounds. Nine blocked shots gave the U.S. rim protection that was missing last year, and the U.S. outscored Canada 50-32 in points in the paint.\n\nStrengthening the interior play was a focal point when building the roster, and it was addressed. Now, Canada isn't big so let's see how the U.S. handles a team with size, like Serbia and Germany in exhibition games.\n\nUS defense stifles Canada\n\nThe U.S. has scorers. Putting up enough points shouldn't be an issue. But defensive-minded U.S. assistant coach Ty Lue wants intense pressure on the opponent's offene. There are multiple All-Defensive players on the roster, and with Derrick White replacing Kawhi Leonard, the U.S. is adding another.\n\nThe U.S. held Canada to 33.8% shooting from the field and 21.2% on 3-pointers, had 11 steals and Davis blocked four shots.\n\nHaliburton had four steals and James had three, and those Canada turnovers helped the U.S. own a 16-2 edge in fastbreak points. The U.S. held MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to 10 points on 3-for-10 shooting and Jamal Murray to five points on 2-for-8 shooting.\n\n\"One of the keys to the game was just the collective ball pressure that our guys had out there, and Jrue obviously leads the way in that regard,\" Kerr said. \"But if we can get all of our guys pressuring the ball, we've got big guys behind the play who can clean things up and it should be a good combination for our defense.\"\n\nUSA Basketball injury updates\n\nThe U.S. was down to 10 Olympians – Kevin Durant sat out with a sore calf, and White wasn't available. He will join the team in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"He has been working (and) rehabbing,\" U.S. men’s national team managing director Grant Hill said of Durant. \"He's looked great. I think we're just being cautious and conservative and I think we expect to see him on the court when we're in Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAfter watching Leonard practice Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, USA Basketball team staffers, led by Hill and in consultation with the Los Angeles Clippers, decided it was best to go in another direction. Leonard missed games at the end of the regular season and playoffs with right knee inflammation. Even though Leonard told reporters he was good to go, USA Basketball had reason to believe he wasn't ready for the Olympics.\n\n\"Kawhi gave it everything he had when he was preparing and those last three days of camp,\" Curry said. \"Obviously they're tough decisions and I know he wanted to play, but it's one of those things where he wished us luck and he wanted us to go get the gold.\n\n\"And you love that kind of support from a guy that's in a tough situation like that, but hopefully for the long term he's in a good place because the game needs him and when he's not out there, you miss an all-time great player. So we hope that he's ready for this season.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/11"}]}

Witt toured with Steppenwolf Theatre Company portraying Kit Carson in “The Time of Your Life” and spent 10 years as a member of the acting ensemble at Arena Stage in Washington D.C.

Plans for a public memorial service are pending.\n\nWhile researching Howard’s first season at the Players in 1959, I discovered he portrayed Carl in “Bus Stop” and Stanley Kowalski in “A Streetcar Named Desire” opposite Broadway sensation Hilda Simms’ portrayal of Blanche DeBouis. Stay tuned to next week’s Players Pen as I share more information on Simms.\n\nThe other night the company raised a glass and toasted Howard. Once a Player, always a Player. As we raised our glasses to toast Howard, I looked up, and I knew he was looking back with a twinkle in his eyes.\n\nOn the opening night of “The Actuary” actor Kyle Hatley, who played Richard, sent the company a happy opening note in which he wrote, “At first, I described it ('The Actuary') to my wife as a love letter to love. And it is. But it is also a love letter to ourselves. On opening night I would like to ask one thing of you all. Look up.”\n\nKyle named a star in honor of the mother, Barb, in “The Actuary.” “So look up,” Kyle wrote. “No matter where you are. No matter when you are. It’ll be up there. Lookin’ right back at ya.”\n\nJoin us at Peninsula Players where the sun sets, the curtain rises and the stars will always shine.\n\nActor Harter Clingman will host a pre-show seminar at 6:30 p.m. July 13 in the theater prior to the 8 p.m. performance of \"Peter and the Starcatcher.\" Harter will share his experience performing in the first national tour of the show.

But sometimes all it takes is that one unforgettable scene to secure victory. Think John Wayne as one-eyed drunken lawman Rooster Cogburn, yelling from atop his horse before a shootout, \"Fill your hand, you sonuvabitch!\" in True Grit. Each of the five nominees up for a best-actor Academy Award on Sunday has his own magic moment on-screen. USA TODAY's Susan Wloszczyna provides a close-up of their trophy-worthy scenes.\n\nBradley Cooper as Pat Solatano in Silver Linings Playbook\n\nThe role: Just released from a mental-health facility after being diagnosed as bipolar, Pat fights to keep his moods in check while still obsessing about his cheating wife, Nikki. His plan to get himself in shape to win her back — despite a restraining order that prevents him from contacting her — is interrupted by Tiffany, a young widow with an attitude as heavy as her eyeliner. Looking to impress his wife with his recovery, Pat agrees to Tiffany's suggestion that she and Pat compete in a dance competition — but only if she gives a letter to Nikki in return.\n\nThe moment: Cooper impresses with at least two scarily realistic and loud breakdowns, one over his frustration with the unhappy ending of the novel A Farewell to Arms, the other when he isn't able to find his old wedding tape. But it is at the end of the film during the dance contest, when a calm Pat has finally gained some focus and knows what he wants, that the actor truly earns his nomination. Not only does he pull off a wonderfully awkward routine with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), but his character's long-awaited reunion with an awed Nikki is warm and gracious, especially when he whispers something in her ear that leaves her smiling wistfully.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln in Lincoln\n\nThe role: Weary, woeful, witty and wily, this is a 16th president worn down by the ongoing Civil War but one who will not compromise his principles as he pushes to abolish slavery once and for all. He is at his best dealing with common folk and knows when to let others handle the dirtier business of politics. Haunted by personal tragedy, Lincoln also struggles to bring peace to his domestic situation.\n\nThe moment: Day-Lewis excels at humanizing such a towering legend, especially when he spins one of Lincoln's folksy yarns — such as the story about Revolutionary War patriot Ethan Allen using an English lord's \"water closet\" and finding a portrait of George Washington inside. But the actor is at his most impressive when Lincoln is his most adamant. When members of his Cabinet waffle over whether passing the 13th Amendment is worth the effort, he raises his voice in frustration, \"We're stepped out upon the world's stage now — now — with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment!\" For added emphasis, he points at those who question him, shouting: \"Now, now, NOW!\"\n\nHugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in Les Misérables\n\nThe role: Poverty and social injustice are rampant in 19th-century France as Valjean, known as prisoner 24601, is finally freed after serving 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread. After struggling to find work, he breaks parole and assumes a new identity as a respected factory owner and mayor. Life grows more complicated, however, after Valjean takes in a young ward, Cosette, while Inspector Javert upholds his vow to hunt him down.\n\nThe moment: In 3½ minutes, Jackman delivers a master class in character transformation as he performs the soliloquy What Have I Done? during the musical's prologue. When a bishop provides shelter and shows Valjean forgiveness even though he steals from him, the embittered ex-con questions his choices. Jackman weeps, his voice sounding rough and raw, as he sings, \"What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?\" Suddenly, his vocals grow strong as he resolves to start anew: \"Jean Valjean is nothing now. Another story must begin!\"\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell in The Master\n\nThe role: Freddie Quell is trouble incarnate, a barely evolved specimen of manhood who drifts through life after serving in the Navy during World War II. He indulges his every appetite, whether it involves drink, sex or violence. That is, until he stumbles upon Lancaster Dodd, a self-made cult leader who sees Freddie as the ultimate guinea pig to test his Scientology-style theories and adopts the traumatized young man into his family.\n\nThe moment: Phoenix's performance crackles with explosive unpredictability, never more so than when his character begins to suspect that his master is a sham in what is essentially a breakup scene. When law officials arrive to arrest Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) on charges of wrongfully withdrawing funds and other counts, Freddie savagely beats the men. The pair are taken away and placed in adjoining cells. A handcuffed Freddie, enraged, repeatedly bashes his head into a top bunk bed and then smashes a toilet with his foot. When Dodd tries to calm him with sermonizing, Freddie grows angrier and accuses him of lying. They end up shouting profanities at each other through the bars, like screeching alpha males in a zoo.\n\nDenzel Washington as Whip Whitaker in Flight\n\nThe role: In the cockpit, Whip is an ace of a commercial pilot, full of studly swagger and smooth talk. But when he is proclaimed a hero after pulling off an impossible landing in a field that saves most of the passengers onboard, the unrepentant alcoholic must face the demons that have sent his personal life into a tailspin and put his job in jeopardy.\n\nThe moment: Washington nails the in-command Whip. But it's not until he exposes his character's dark side that his performance comes fully alive. The person who awakens in the hospital is in stark contrast to the one who just performed a miracle in the sky. Battered, beaten and shaky, he soon will encounter another scary proposition: facing charges that he was intoxicated when he flew the doomed plane. Before that, he is still taking it all in when a safety officer begins the process of interrogating him while a union rep, his old pal Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), stands guard. A single tear falls from Whip's unbandaged eye when he mentions his estranged son. The fact that the first person he calls is his drug dealer says more about his situation than any words.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/07/biden-medal-of-freedom-denzel-washington-simone-biles/7820818001/", "title": "Denzel Washington, Simone Biles: Who is getting Medal of Freedom?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden presented the Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest honor – to 17 people Thursday, including actor Denzel Washington, gymnast Simone Biles and former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\n\nThe president also presented the award posthumously to Sen.

AnthonyRapp, an actor on Star Trek: Discovery, told BuzzFeed in an interview on Oct. 29 that Spacey made sexual advances in 1986, when he was 14, in Spacey's New York apartment. Spacey issued a statement saying he was \"beyond horrified\" to hear the accusation, insisting he didn't remember the encounter but apologizing to Rapp. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public, infuriating gay rights advocates who viewed his acknowledgment as a false conflation of homosexuality with pedophilia in an attempt to distract attention from the underlying accusation.\n\n2. Roberto Cavazos, a Mexican actor, said in Spanish in a Facebook post on Oct. 30 that Spacey fondled or tried to fondle him against his will while he was at the Old Vic theater in London and Spacey was artistic director there. \"Those of us who were around him at the Old Vic know that a lot more people will come forward with their stories in the coming days and weeks,\" Cavazos said in the post.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\n3. Daniel Beal, told London tabloid The Sun on Oct. 31 and The Daily Mail on Nov. 7 that in 2010, when he was 19 and working as a bartender in a West Sussex hotel, Spacey exposed himself to him outside the hotel while he was on a cigarette break. He continued, saying Spacey gave him an expensive watch to buy his silence.\n\n4. Justin Dawes told BuzzFeed on Nov. 3 he was 16 and a theater usher in New Haven, Conn., in 1988, when Spacey, then appearing in a play there, invited him and a male friend to his apartment to watch a movie. Instead, Dawes said, Spacey gave them cocktails and played pornography on the TV. Dawes said it was \"awkward\" but not intimidating, and they left without incident. Still, “He knew that I was in high school. It was pretty clear. It's not like I was pretending to be an older, cooler person.”\n\n5. Mark Ebenhoch was a 35-year-old military advisor working in uniform on the set of 1995's Outbreak when, he said, Spacey (who had a role in the movie) instructed one of his \"harem\" of young male crewmembers to solicit him for sex with Spacey, BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3. Ebenhoch turned him down feigning disgust because he was then in the closet himself and feared repercussions for his career. “As a military adviser the last thing you’d want anyone to know is that you were gay,” he told BuzzFeed.\n\n6. Harry Dreyfuss: The son of Oscar-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss wrote a first-person column in BuzzFeed on Nov. 4 describing how Spacey groped his genitals when he was 18 and his father was in the room. Harry Dreyfuss said it happened in 2008 in London when Spacey was directing his father in a play at the Old Vic and the three were alone in Spacey's apartment rehearsing lines.\n\nHis father didn't see it, and he didn't tell him until many years later. Instead, Harry Dreyfuss, now an actor and writer in Los Angeles, told jokes about it at parties, although now he realizes there was nothing funny about it. “Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator. But I still never thought talking about it seriously was ever an option.” Buzzfeed quoted Bryan Freedman, one of Spacey's lawyers, as rejecting Harry's allegation: “Let me be clear, Mr. Spacey absolutely denies the allegations.”\n\n7. Tony Montana told USA TODAY on Nov. 1 that a drunken Spacey confronted him in 2003 at a Los Angeles pub, groped his genitals and chased him into a bathroom. \"He grabbed my whole package, he grabbed me hard; no one had ever done that to me,\" said Montana, who was then in his 30s.\n\n8. Kris Nixon, a 20-year-old bartender from Belfast, was working at a bar Spacey frequented near the Old Vic in 2007. He told People and The Sun on Nov. 6 he was invited to a party at Spacey’s London apartment; he was sitting on a sofa when Spacey sat beside him and grabbed his crotch. \"He was drunk but not paralytic. I walked over to (my girlfriend) and said, ‘We need to leave.’ ” He brushed it off as \"just some drunk guy\" and never reported the incident. \"It was my word against his and who is going to believe me?\"\n\nAnonymous accusers:\n\n9. Anonymous bartender: London police said on Nov. 1 it is investigating an allegation by a man, then 23, who said Spacey sexually assaulted him in 2008 after he passed out at Spacey's London home where he had gone seeking advice on his career. He left after Spacey warned him to keep quiet about it.\n\n10. Anonymous New York artist: A former child actortold Vulture on Nov. 2 that he began a sexual relationship with Spacey in 1983 when he was 14 and Spacey was 24, and that it ended when he was 15 and after Spacey allegedly attempted to rape him. He said he believes Spacey is a \"pedophile.\"\n\n11. Anonymous productionassistant: CNN reported on Nov. 2 that a former production assistant on House of Cards said Spacey sexually assaulted him, putting his hand down the assistant's pants while Spacey was driving them to the Baltimore-area set during one of the show's early seasons. The assistant said the touching was non-consensual.\n\n12. Anonymous British journalist: BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3 that a British journalist then in his 20s interviewed Spacey for a magazine in London in the early 2000s and afterward went to a club with Spacey and some of his friends. He said Spacey repeatedly grabbed his genitals and angrily tried to block him from fleeing. The journalist realized he could not write about the encounter because it meant outing then-closeted Spacey as gay. \"If I were to publish a story about Kevin Spacey sexually harassing me on the job … there's no way without making it quite clear that he likes guys,\" he said. The interview ran without his byline.\n\n13. \"John\" told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire on Oct. 31 that Spacey tried to seduce him at his New York apartment in 1984 when he was 17. He said Spacey asked him to share his bed, but he slept on the sofa and woke up with the actor's arms around him. He said he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but added, \"I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst.\"\n\n14. Heather Unruh's son: The former Boston TV news anchor held a press conference Nov. 8 in Boston to accuse Spacey of groping the genitals of her then-18-year-old son in a bar on Nantucket, Mass., in July 2016. Unruh said her son filed a report on the allegation with police and \"a criminal investigation has been opened,\" though police said they could not confirm or deny that due to state law. If confirmed, his case would be the first under police investigation in America. And as the most recent, it could potentially lead to criminal charges.\n\n15. Andy Holtmzan: In 1981, the NYU grad was working at The Public Theater in New York when Spacey, then 22 and an up-and-coming actor with a minor role in their production of Henry IV, Part 1, committed what he termed a \"wordless assault.\" Holtzman told USA TODAY he was on a phone call when Spacey began his attack.\n\n\"Within minutes, wordlessly, he was up and all over me,\" Holtzman, now a 64-year-old marketing consultant, recalled. \"The aggression was certainly more than a grope. When I was finally able to push him off and scream (at him), he theatrically stepped back, incredibly angry, grabbed his coat and bag, stormed out and slammed the door.\"\n\nHoltzman said the encounter, which happened when he was 27, left him more stunned than traumatized. He was gay and comfortable with his sexuality but said he wasn't interested in Spacey, who was then in the closet. He couldn't fathom why the actor would do such a thing to him and then react the way he did when he was rebuffed.\n\n\"It was the look on his face that was really shocking and then scary,\" Holtzman said. \"The anger was undeserved. If you ask for something and get a no, then I can understand the anger, but you ask for nothing and then try to take everything? Where is that anger coming from?\"\n\nIf you have ever experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct while working in the entertainment industry, we’d like to hear from you.

Applications for the May 29 through June 30 program must be submitted by March 11.\n\n“Mississippi still has the lowest number of physicians per capita in the nation, which limits access to care and contributes to many of the negative health issues plaguing our state,” said Ann Sansing, community health coordinator for the MSU Extension Service. “The one constant in health care reform discussions is the need for more primary care physicians. The scholars program is helping to address that need in Mississippi.”\n\nSansing said with a declining number of rural physicians, the concern for adequate health care increases as well. A goal of the program is to develop a pipeline of future medical providers.\n\n“To date, 341 students have participated in the RMS program, with most planning health-related careers. Thirty-six of our graduates went on to medical school, and 28 of those are practicing physicians today,” she said.\n\nStudents between their junior and senior years with ACT composite scores of at least 24 will take two premed courses on the Starkville campus — biology and sociology — and observe doctors at practice.\n\nThe selected scholars will receive tuition, housing and textbooks during the program. A $60 registration fee is required after acceptance, and the scholars will be responsible for their food expenses. Applications and program details are available online at www.RMS.msucares.com.\n\nWilliam Carey University\n\nOnline master’s in criminal justice offered\n\nWilliam Carey University will offer an online master’s degree in criminal justice beginning with the winter term in February 2016.\n\nThe master’s degree offers several benefits to those with an interest in the field, said Karla Pope, who chairs Carey’s Department of Criminal Justice.\n\n“For students currently employed in the field of criminal justice, the master’s degree will offer a competitive edge when testing for promotion within the agency and, in some instances, will provide an educational pay incentive,” said Pope. “A master’s degree also provides qualifications for an individual wanting to teach criminal justice at the undergraduate level in community colleges or on the university level.”\n\nThe degree will also provide an opportunity for graduates of Carey’s undergraduate criminal justice program to continue their education. The criminal justice program started at the Tradition campus in Biloxi in fall 2012 with two students and has now expanded to more than 60 students.\n\nThe degree, which is offered in both master of arts and master of science tracks, consists of 30 required hours. Twenty-four of the 30 hours will be required courses. The M.A. degree track will include an additional six hours of thesis work. The M.S. track will include six hours of additional electives and a comprehensive written exam upon conclusion of the required coursework.\n\nFor more information, contact Pope at (228) 702-1834 or kpope@wmcarey.edu.\n\n“We are looking to add three or four new online programs in the coming months, along with new cohort groups in the state,” he said. “We are also looking to expand our online delivery methods through live-streaming and video-streaming technologies.”\n\nThe school’s online graduate offerings currently include Master of Education degrees in the areas of elementary education, secondary education, and mild and moderate disabilities; the Specialist of Education degree in instructional leadership; and the Doctor of Education degree in educational leadership.\n\nFor more information on online graduate education programs at Carey, call (601) 318-6600 or visit www.wmcarey.edu/elearning.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/kentucky-derby/celebrities/2017/04/24/whos-coming-barnstable-brown-derby-eve-gala-2017/100757118/", "title": "Who's coming to Barnstable Brown Derby Eve Gala 2017?", "text": "Kirby Adams\n\n@kirbylouisville\n\nBARNSTABLE BROWN GUEST LIST\n\nMusicians and performers\n\nHarry Connick Jr. – Grammy and Emmy award-winning music superstar\n\nKid Rock – singer, rapper, songwriter, musician, record producer and actor\n\nMaren Morris – country music singer, songwriter and record producer\n\nGregory Turay - Metropolitan Opera star\n\nKacey Musgraves – country music singer and songwriter\n\nSammy Hagar – rock vocalist, (Van Halen) guitarist, songwriter, music and entrepreneur\n\nRichie Sambora – rock guitarist (Bon Jovi), producer, singer and songwriter\n\nBoyz II Men – R&B vocal group\n\nKix Brooks – country music artist (Brooks & Dunn), actor and producer\n\nCAM – country music artist and songwriter\n\nTerri Clark – country music artist\n\nTaylor Dayne – singer-songwriter\n\nJoey Fatone – singer (*NSYNC), dancer, actor and television personality\n\nMontgomery Gentry – country music duo and Kentucky natives\n\nJohnny Gill – singer-songwriter and actor\n\nBrian McKnight – R&B singer-songwriter, arranger, producer and musician\n\nRickey Medlocke – singer, guitarist (Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blackfoot)\n\nOrianthi – musician, singer and songwriter\n\nJordan Smith – singer, musician and Kentucky native\n\nTravis Tritt – country music singer, songwriter and actor\n\nClay Walker – country music artist\n\nMary Wilson – vocalist, founding member of the Supremes\n\nALSO: Inside the 'incredible' guest list for Barnstable Brown 2017\n\nMORE: Barnstable Brown and Derby Festival host TV's hottest actor\n\nMORE: Kentucky Derby: Everything you need to know\n\nActors, models and celebrity personalities\n\nJeff Bridges - actor, singer, and producer\n\nLarry David – comedian, writer, actor, playwright and television producer (Seinfeld)\n\nTracy Morgan – actor and comedian\n\nKatie Couric – journalist and author\n\nJustin Hartley* -- actor (“This is Us”)\n\nGiada De Laurentiis – chef, writer and television personality\n\nStephen Amell – actor (“Arrow”)\n\nLarry Birkhead – celebrity personality\n\nJustin Cornwell* – actor (“Training Day”)\n\nJosh Henderson – actor (“Dallas”)\n\nChrishell Stause* -- actress and Kentucky native\n\nMORE: What to wear - and not wear- to the Kentucky Derby\n\nMORE: How to spot a celebrity at the Kentucky Derby\n\nMORE: Throw the perfect Derby party - with minimal prep\n\nSports celebrities\n\nNew England Patriots Super Bowl Champions:\n\nTom Brady\n\nDanny Amendola\n\nJulian Edelman\n\nRob Gronkowski\n\nAlso:\n\nAaron Rodgers - Green Bay Packers\n\nRandall Cobb - Green Bay Packers (Former University of Kentucky player)\n\nMatt Cassel - Tennessee Titans\n\nJay Gruden - coach of Washington Redskins\n\nRickie Fowler – PGA Tour golfer\n\nBrooks Koepka -- PGA Tour golfer\n\nJustin Thomas – PGA Tour golfer (Louisville area native, St. X grad)\n\nJimmy Walker – PGA Tour golfer\n\nBode Miller – gold medal Olympic skier\n\nRob O'Neill -- US Decorated Navy Seal\n\n* co-hosted by the Kentucky Derby Festival\n\nMore on the Kentucky Derby 2017:\n\nDerby fashion hacks - and tiny tips - to save the day\n\n6 easy-to-follow-Derby style tips for men\n\n8 entertaining essentials for your Derby party\n\n► ON THE GO?

He was 97.\n\nJewison, a three-time Oscar nominee who in 1999 received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement, died \"peacefully\" Saturday, according to publicist Jeff Sanderson. Additional details were not immediately available.\n\nThroughout his long career, Jewison combined light entertainment with topical films that appealed to him on a deeply personal level. As Jewison was ending his military service in the Canadian navy during World War II, he hitchhiked through the American South and had a close-up view of Jim Crow segregation.\n\nIn his autobiography \"This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me,\" he noted that racism and injustice became his most common themes.\n\n\"Every time a film deals with racism, many Americans feel uncomfortable,\" he wrote. \"Yet it has to be confronted. We have to deal with prejudice and injustice or we will never understand what is good and evil, right and wrong; we need to feel how ‘the other’ feels.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHe drew upon his experiences for 1967's \"In the Heat of the Night,\" starring Rod Steiger as a white racist small-town sheriff and Sidney Poitier as a Black detective from Philadelphia trying to help solve a murder and eventually forming a working relationship with the hostile local lawman.\n\nJames Baldwin condemned the film’s \"appalling distance from reality,\" and thought the director was trapped in a fantasy of racial harmony that would only heighten \"Black rage and despair.\" Jewison’s production won the Academy Award for best picture while Steiger took home the best-actor Oscar. (Jewison lost out for best director to Mike Nichols of \"The Graduate\").\n\nAmong those who encouraged Jewison while making \"In the Heat of the Night\": Robert F. Kennedy, whom the director met during a ski trip in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\n\"I told him I made films and he asked what kind I make,\" he recalled in a 2011 interview with The Hollywood Reporter. \"So I told him that I was working on ‘In the Heat of the Night’ and that it’s about two cops: one a white sheriff from Mississippi and the other a black detective from Philadelphia. I told him it was a film about tolerance. So he listened and nodded and said ‘You know, Norman, timing is everything. In politics, in art, in life itself.’ I never forgot that.\"\n\nJewison received two other Oscar nominations, for “Fiddler on the Roof” and “Moonstruck,” the beloved romantic comedy for which Cher won an Academy Award for best actress. He also worked on such notable films as the Cold War spoof “The Russian Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming,” the Steve McQueen thriller “The Thomas Crown Affair” and a pair of movies featuring Denzel Washington: the racial drama “A Soldier’s Story” and “The Hurricane,” starring Washington as wrongly imprisoned boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter.\n\nA third project with Washington never made it to production. In the early 1990s, Jewison was set to direct a biography of Malcolm X, but backed out amid protests from Spike Lee and others that a white director shouldn’t make the film. Lee ended up directing.\n\nFive Jewison films received best Oscar nominations: “In the Heat of the Night,” “The Russian Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming,” “Fiddler On the Roof,” “Moonstruck” and “A Soldier’s Story.”\n\nHis other films included “F.I.S.T.”, a flop with Sylvester Stallone as a Jimmy Hoffa-style labor leader; “...And Justice for All” (1979), with Al Pacino fighting a crooked judicial system; and “In Country,” featuring Bruce Willis as a Vietnam War veteran. His most recent work, the 2003 thriller “The Statement,” starred Michael Caine and Tilda Swinton and flopped at the box office.\n\nJewison and his wife Margaret Ann Dixon (nicknamed Dixie) had three children, sons Kevin and Michael and daughter Jennifer Ann, who became an actress and appeared in the Jewison films “Agnes of God” and “Best Friends.” The Jewisons were married 51 years, until her death in 2004. He married Lynne St. David in 2010.\n\nJewison, honored by Canada in 2003 with a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, remained close to his home country. When he wasn’t working, he lived on a 200-acre farm near Toronto, where he raised horses and cattle and produced maple syrup. He founded the Canadian Film Centre in 1988 and for years hosted barbecues during the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nThe Toronto-born Jewison began acting at age 6, appearing before Masonic lodge gatherings. After graduating from Victoria College, he went to work for the BBC in London, then returned to Canada and directed programs for the CBC. His work there brought offers from Hollywood and he quickly earned a reputation as a director of TV musicals, with stars including Judy Garland, Danny Kaye and Harry Belafonte. Jewison shifted to feature films in 1963 with the comedy “40 Pounds of Trouble,” starring Tony Curtis and Suzanne Pleshette.\n\nThe director’s light touch prompted Universal to assign him to a series of comedies, including “The Thrill of It All,” which paired Day with James Garner, and “Send Me No Flowers,” starring Day and Rock Hudson. Wearying of such scripts, Jewison used a loophole in his contract to move to MGM for 1965’s “The Cincinnati Kid,” a drama of the gambling world starring McQueen and Edward G. Robinson. He followed with “The Russian Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming,” which starred Carl Reiner and Eva Marie Saint and was the breakthrough film for Alan Arkin.\n\n\"I never really became as much a part of the establishment as I wanted to be,” he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2011. \"I wanted to be accepted. I wanted people to say ‘that was a great picture.’ I mean I have a big ego like anyone else. I’m no shrinking violet. But I never felt totally accepted — but maybe that’s good.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/01/30/chita-rivera-dies-west-side-story-broadway-tony-award/72411091007/", "title": "Chita Rivera dead: 'West Side Story,' Broadway star was 91", "text": "Mark Kennedy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK — Chita Rivera, the dynamic dancer, singer and actress who garnered 10 Tony nominations, winning twice, in a long Broadway career that forged a path for Latina artists and shrugged off a near-fatal car accident, died Tuesday. She was 91.\n\nRivera's death was announced by her daughter, Lisa Mordente, who said she died in New York after a brief illness.\n\nRivera first gained wide notice in 1957 as Anita in the original production of \"West Side Story\" and was still dancing on Broadway with her trademark energy a half-century later in 2015's \"The Visit.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn’t moving or telling a story to you or singing a song,\" she told The Associated Press then. \"That's the spirit of my life, and I'm really so lucky to be able to do what I love, even at this time in my life.\"\n\nFrom 2013:Chita Rivera at 80 is 'still living my life'\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2024\n\nIn August 2009, Rivera was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the U.S. can give a civilian. Rivera put her hand over her heart and shook her head in wonderment as President Barack Obama presented the medal. In 2013, she was the marshal at the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.\n\nRivera rose from chorus girl to star, collaborating along the way with many of Broadway’s greatest talents, including Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Michael Kidd, Harold Prince, Jack Cole, Peter Gennaro and John Kander and Fred Ebb.\n\nShe rebounded from a car accident in 1988 that crushed her right leg and became an indefatigable star on the road. She was on Broadway in a raucous production of \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" in 2012 and the chilly \"The Visit\" in 2014, earning another best actress Tony nomination.\n\n\"She can’t rehearse except for full-out,\" said playwright Terrence McNally in 2005. \"She can’t perform except for full-out, no matter what the size of the house. She’s going to be there 101% for that audience.\"\n\nShe won Tonys for \"The Rink\" in 1984 and \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" in 1993. When accepting a Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2018, she said \"I wouldn’t trade my life in the theater for anything, because theater is life.\"\n\nShe was nominated for the award seven other times, for \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" which opened in 1960; \"Chicago,\" 1975; \"Bring Back Birdie,\" 1981; \"Merlin,\" 1983; \"Jerry’s Girls,\" 1985; \"Nine,\" 2003; and \"Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life,\" 2005.\n\n\"I don’t think we have enough original musicals,” she told The Associated Press in 2012. “I know I’m being old fashioned, but the theater is the place where music, lyrics, words, scenery and stories come together. And I’ve been blessed enough to have done several shows when they really did. They take you places and they’re daring. That’s what we need.\"\n\nHer albums include 16 tracks pulled from her original cast recordings and put out as part of Sony’s Legends of Broadway series and two solo CDs — \"And Now I Sing\" for a tiny record label in the 1960s and \"And Now I Swing\" in 2009 for Yellow Sound Label.\n\nIn the 1993 musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" Rivera played the title role, a glamorous movie star at the center of the fantasy life of an inmate in a South American prison. The story, from a novel by Manuel Puig, had already been made into an Oscar-winning 1985 movie.\n\nIn his review, then-Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara wrote that Rivera \"is more than a musical theater star. She’s a force of nature — which is exactly what is needed for the role of the Spider Woman. With her Louise Brooks haircut, brassy voice and lithe dancer’s body, Rivera dominates the stage whenever she appears.\"\n\nIn 1975, she originated the role of Velma Kelly (to Gwen Verdon’s Roxie Hart) in the original Broadway production of \"Chicago.\" Rivera had a small role in the 2002 film version, while Catherine Zeta-Jones won the best supporting actress Oscar as Velma — just as Rita Moreno had picked up an Oscar for her portrayal of Anita in \"West Side Story.\"\n\nThe songwriters for \"Chicago,\" Kander and Ebb, also wrote Rivera’s first Tony-winning performance, for \"The Rink.\" In winning the Tony for best actress in a musical, Rivera topped the show’s top star, Liza Minnelli, who also had been nominated. The two played a mother and daughter who struggle to rebuild their relationship after a long estrangement; the setting is an old-fashioned roller rink that has seen better days.\n\n\"Spider Woman\" had been her first Broadway show since 1986, when she suffered a broken leg in the traffic accident while she was appearing in “Jerry's Girls,” a Broadway tribute to the songs of Jerry Herman.\n\nAt the Tony awards a few weeks later, she flashed her cast and belted out \"Put on a Happy Face\" from the musical “Bye, Bye, Birdie.”\n\nIt took months of physical therapy to bring back her dancing skills. She told The Associated Press: \"It never entered my mind that I wouldn’t dance again. Never. I can’t explain to you why. It’s hard work getting back but that’s what I’m doing.\"\n\n“My spirit is still there.”\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, the Broadway songwriter and performer, featured Rivera in a scene in his 2021 film adaptation of “Tick, Tick... Boom,” and in a statement said having her included \"remains one of the all-time joys of my life.”\n\nDolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero was born Jan. 23, 1933, in Washington, D.C. Her Puerto Rican father, Pedro del Rivero, was a musician who played in the United States Navy Band, who died when she was 7. Her mother was Scottish and Italian descent.\n\nShe took dance classes and then entered the prestigious School of American Ballet in New York. Her first theater gig, at age 17, was in the touring company of \"Call Me Madam.\" That led to chorus stints in such shows as “Guys and Dolls” and “Can-Can.”\n\nIn her 2023 memoir, “Chita: A Memoir,” another woman steals scene after scene: her self-proclaimed alter ego, Dolores. Unapologetic and fiery, Dolores was the unfiltered version of Chita and served as motivation in times of self-doubt. In one chapter, Rivera writes that she doesn’t read reviews “or Dolores just might invest in a dozen voodoo dolls.”\n\n“I consist of — and I think we all do — I consist of two people: Dolores and Conchita,” Rivera sain in an interview with the AP that year. “Conchita, she’s the one that has been taking all the glory, you know. She’s been doing all the shows, but Dolores is the one that’s pushed her into it. And she’s been keeping me on track, so I listen to Dolores. I listen to her. She’s growing in my head now as we speak.”\n\nAmong other early appearances on the New York stage were roles in “The Shoestring Revue,” 1955; a 1955 musical version of “Seventh Heaven” starring Ricardo Montalban; and “Mr. Wonderful,” a 1956 show starring Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n“I can’t believe that I’ve been given the gift to look back and relive my life,” she told The Associated Press shortly before “The Dancer’s Life” opened on Broadway in late 2005. “It’s about how anybody can do it — if you really believe it, you have the good fortune, you do all the right things and you really work hard.”\n\nRivera, who had a relationship with the now-deceased Davis, married fellow “West Side Story” performer Tony Mordente in 1957. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Lisa Mordente, also became a performer who occasionally appeared on Broadway, garnering a Tony nomination in 1982 for “Marlowe.”\n\nAmong those honoring Rivera on social media were actor Jason Alexander, who said “she set the bar in every way,” and actor and dancer Debbie Allen, who wrote: “I will miss touching you, but I will forever hear your laughter and hold that baton of power you tossed my way.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/30"}]}
