The jar was located at the entrance of the museum and the boy was “driven by curiosity,” so he reached out to touch the jar, accidentally tipping it over.\n\nCall it the 'Swift'-sonian:Free Taylor Swift fashion exhibit on display in London\n\nJar from Middle Bronze Age will be restored\n\nThe jar dates back to the Middle Bronze Age, between 2200 and 1500 BCE, Rivlin said.\n\n“It predates the time of King David and King Solomon and is characteristic of the Canaan region,” Rivlin said, adding that the jar was used to store and transport local supplies such as wine and olive oil.\n\nResearchers have previously found similar jars during excavations, but they were already broken. The jar the 4-year-old boy broke was intact and larger than most others, making it “an impressive find,” Rivlin said.\n\nThe museum has already contacted someone to restore the jar – Roy Shafir from the University of Haifa's School of Archaeology and Marine Cultures. He specializes in conservation.\n\nThe jar will be restored and returned to the museum once it is complete, Rivlin said. The museum also plans to document the restoration process.\n\nWhat will happen to the 4-year-old boy who broke the jar?\n\nRivlin has invited the child and his family to visit the museum again and see the jar once it is restored. The child’s family has already taken the museum up on its offer to return once the job is done. They will also get an organized tour.\n\nWhile sometimes display items are damaged on purpose and staff contact police, this is not one of those cases, Rivlin said in her statement.\n\nAccording to Rivlin, part of the museum’s mission is to make sure the public can see and learn about archaeological items, usually without barriers such as glass walls.\n\n“The museum believes that there is a special charm in experiencing an archaeological find without any obstructions, and despite the rare incident with the jar, the Hecht Museum will continue this tradition,” Rivlin said in her statement.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

The House State Government Committee voted 8-4 for the Gender Is Real Legislative Act, or GIRL Act, by Republican Rep. Chris Pringle. The bill, which awaits input from the full House, would ban K-12 schools from allowing trans athletes to compete under their gender identity. It would instead require students to participate under the gender listed on their original birth certificate. Opponents criticized the measure as motivated by fear and discrimination toward trans people. Pringle said the bill is designed to ensure a level playing field in girls’ sporting events. Pringle acknowledged he knew of no competition problems in Alabama but said disputes have arisen in other states.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Fish and Game will conduct its fourth survey of moose in the Anchorage area with the help of citizen scientists. The three-day survey relies on citizens to call or text in sightings of moose. The 2020 survey begins at 8 a.m. Friday and runs through 5 p.m. Sunday. Biologists in less populated areas conduct moose surveys from the air. Pilots fly paths close to the ground and circle when they spot moose. Anchorage air traffic and flight restrictions make that impossible, said Dave Battle, area biologist. “It’s just not something that can be done in the Anchorage Bowl,” he said. Anchorage spans 1,963 square miles, an area the size of the state of Delaware, with a population as of July 2018 of 291,500. Residents embrace moose as part of the landscape, and the animals at times can be seen in the busiest parts of the city.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The City Council has voted to oppose controversial state legislation that would seek voter approval to enshrine a statewide ban on sanctuary cities in the Arizona Constitution. The Republican-led Legislature already has taken the first steps to pass the legislation for a constitutional ban on sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The state already has an existing ban on sanctuary cities, implemented in 2011. The Arizona Daily Star reports that while no local jurisdictions in Arizona meet the definition of a sanctuary city, and the city of Tucson overwhelmingly rejected a ballot proposition to become one in November, law enforcement agencies in Tucson have adopted immigrant-friendly policies.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said it won’t reconsider its ruling rejecting a death row inmate’s request for new DNA testing of evidence that his attorneys say could exonerate him. In a 5-2 decision, justices rejected Stacey Johnson’s petition for rehearing over the court’s decision last year that he wasn’t entitled to the additional testing of evidence from the 1993 killing of Carol Heath. Johnson was one of eight inmates Arkansas sought to execute over an 11-day period in 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. Johnson and three other inmates were spared by the courts, and Arkansas ultimately put the other four men to death. Arkansas doesn’t have any executions scheduled, but Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in December said the court’s ruling cleared the way for Johnson’s. Arkansas doesn’t currently have any execution drugs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In an unusual reversal, federal regulators this week agreed to cover about $300 million in repair costs at the Oroville Dam, where a spillway collapse three years ago prompted the evacuation of nearly 190,000 people in Northern California. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said last March that it wouldn’t pay for repairs involving damage regulators said existed at the Sierra Nevada dam before the collapse. But after an appeal, FEMA agreed to cover the repairs, the Sacramento Bee reports. The state now expects to be reimbursed for about $750 million of the $1.1 billion in repair costs, Erin Mellon, spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said in an email to the Bee. “This is pretty rare, and for California it’s huge money,” Jerry Quinn, a Sacramento consultant who helps government agencies recover money from FEMA, told the paper.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Graduates from the U.S. Air Force Academy in the state are expected to cross-commission into the Space Force this spring, military officials said. About 60 cadets would be commissioned into the new armed service branch, which formed in December with the signing of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act, the Gazette reports. “They’re doing Air Force Academy curriculum, and they’ll just be directly commissioned into the Space Force,” academy Vice Superintendent Col. Houston Cantwell said. Academy leaders and members of the Colorado’s congressional delegation announced the cross-commission plan at an oversight Board of Visitors meeting Wednesday. The plan would be similar to how the U.S. Naval Academy commissions Marine officers. It is unclear how exactly academy leaders plan to commission cadets into the Space Force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont says he is dropping his plan for highway tolls for trucks, expressing frustration with legislative leaders who have delayed a vote on the issue. The General Assembly had planned to vote Thursday on the tolls, which were under consideration to fund a wide-ranging transportation improvement plan. But Lamont, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the Senate needed more time. “I think it’s time to take a pause,” Lamont said at a news conference. Tolls for trucks had been projected to raise an estimated $200 million. Lamont said he plans for now to generate that money instead through state borrowing.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some lawmakers want the state to start compensating people who were put in prison and then later found to be not guilty. A bill waiting on a vote in the state House would compensate people as much as $50,000 per year they were incarcerated, as well as some attorney’s fees. Emeka Igwe, an attorney, said his client Elmer Daniels was the “catalyst” for the legislation. After Daniels served 39 years for a rape he says he didn’t commit, “he was basically released with just a T-shirt on his back and left to fend for himself.” Under the proposed bill, if someone were imprisoned in Delaware for one or more crimes that they didn’t commit, they could file a complaint in Superior Court within three years of the wrongful conviction being reversed or vacated. If an eligible person had been in prison for less than a year, their compensation would be $137 for each day they were incarcerated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: What country music is to Nashville and jazz is to New Orleans, go-go is to D.C. And on Wednesday, the living legends of go-go music came out to the Culture House DC art center to witness history, WUSA-TV reports. Gregory “Sugar Bear” Elliot, lead singer of Experience Unlimited; Big G of BackYard Band; and the oldest daughter of Chuck Brown – the godfather of go-go – were all present to see Mayor Muriel Bowser sign a bill designating go-go as the official music of D.C. The creative arts performance space was packed with people wearing green “Don’t Mute DC” hats and T-shirts, and the crowd was pumped up. Before signing the official document, in true call-and-repeat go-go fashion, Bowser asked the crowd to chant with her. “When I say go-go, you say ‘is D.C.,’ ” she shouted. The crowd enthusiastically chanted it three times.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: An algae toxin 1,000 times deadlier than cyanide lingers at trace levels in the livers of bottlenose dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon, a new study shows, remaining there even when the algae is not blooming. The long-term health implications for the lagoon’s top predator and other marine life remain uncertain. “We’re not making any conclusions about what it’s doing to them,” said Spencer Fire, an assistant professor at Florida Tech. The study for the first time establishes a baseline level of the toxin in lagoon dolphins by which to compare future toxin levels during dolphin strandings or die-offs. “This is what we expect to be sort of background levels,” Fire said. The poison, called saxitoxin, comes from the same algae that glows like fairy dust at night in the lagoon. The study, led by Florida Tech, is the first report of saxitoxin being detected in marine mammals absent an algae bloom.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Lawmakers are considering raising the state’s minimum dropout age from 16 to 17. But a Wednesday hearing on Senate Bill 343 revealed concerns about how much additional students would cost the state, as well as whether it’s worthwhile for the state to try to force uninterested teens to remain in school. The Senate Education and Youth Committee didn’t vote on the bill. Chairman P.K. Martin, a Lawrenceville Republican, promised another hearing, but it’s unclear if the measure will move forward. Some Democrats have been seeking for years to raise past 16 the age for students choosing to leave school. “If we allow young people to leave our schools at 16, there are no jobs for them,” said the bill’s sponsor, Democrat Lester Jackson of Savannah. He argues the 16-year-old age was set when unskilled jobs such as being a farmhand were widely available.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A paddleboarder earned the Maui Police Department’s highest civilian honor for fighting off an attack by a tiger shark to protect members of a tour group he was leading. The department awarded its Civilian Medal of Valor to Triston Kahookele-Santos on Tuesday, The Maui News reports. The 20-year-old employee of the Andaz Beach Crew, part of the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, was leading five stand-up paddle-boarders about a quarter-mile offshore about 9:30 a.m. Feb. 5. The group was watching whales and following fish and a manta ray, Maui police spokeswoman Lt. Audra Sellers said. A 10-foot tiger shark appeared and launched an attack at a Washington man in the group, “violently thrashing his board,” Sellers said. Kahookele-Santos used the blade of his paddle to strike the shark, which let go of the board and turned on Kahookele-Santos. The others paddled safely to shore as he fought off the shark with the paddle while it circled him three times. No injuries were reported as a result of the attack.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would reduce the number of people required to report suspected child abuse narrowly won approval from a panel of state lawmakers. The House Judiciary and Rules Committee approved the bill 9-8, The Times-News reports. Currently, anyone in the state who sees evidence of child abuse, abandonment or neglect is required to report that evidence to law enforcement, and those who don’t can be charged with a misdemeanor. The legislation approved Wednesday would remove that requirement for most residents, leaving only teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers as mandatory reporters. Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, says unfounded child abuse claims cost taxpayers money. But Rep. John McCrostie, D-Boise, and Rep. Linda Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, both opposed the legislation, saying it could lead to underreporting of child abuse, causing real harm to Idaho kids. The bill now heads to the full House.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s former police chief has been receiving a pension of more than $15,800 a month since the mayor fired him in December for allegedly lying about a night he was found asleep in his city-issued SUV, according to a newspaper report. Eddie Johnson was awarded the pension by the Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reports, citing records it obtained under Illinois’ Freedom of Information Act. The pension adds up to nearly $190,000 annually, or 75% of his average salary of just over $253,000 per year during his final four years with the Chicago Police Department. Johnson, 59, blamed medication for making him drowsy before he was found asleep in his SUV, but media reports disclosed that the married superintendent had been drinking for hours and kissing a woman on his security detail and that the responding officers took steps to keep it secret.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor has told state agencies to calculate the damage along the Lake Michigan shoreline that’s been caused by high water ahead of possibly seeking federal assistance. The order announced Thursday comes as several lakeshore communities have already declared local beach erosion emergencies with waves damaging property and threatening roads. The Indiana Department of Homeland Security has declined to declare a state emergency, but Gov. Eric Holcomb said he wanted a new review after viewing the shoreline by helicopter Sunday. The erosion is happening as Lake Michigan approaches its highest levels in recorded history, and forecasters expect the Great Lakes to remain high well into 2020. State Sen. Karen Tallian, an Ogden Dunes Democrat, called Holcomb’s action “long overdue,” as she asked the governor for an emergency declaration almost two months ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Those hoping to visit the “Field of Dreams” movie site the week of Major League Baseball’s game between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox had better have a ticket. Go the Distance, which runs the site of the iconic baseball movie, announced the grounds would be inaccessible to fans Aug. 8-16. The White Sox and Yankees will play Aug. 13 on a specially made field located next to the field and on the grounds. A spokesperson for MLB says information about ticket plans for the game will be made available in March or April. The site has been a hot-spot tourist attraction for baseball fans who have flocked to the iconic diamond built in the middle of a Dyersville cornfield, made famous by Kevin Costner’s 1989 blockbuster. There will be plenty of other activities around town before the game, including exhibits, games, a Fan Fest and a movie showing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Legislature’s auditing division says state agencies have significant information technology security weaknesses and haven’t made progress since previous reports showed the same problems. More than half of 19 state agencies studied failed to comply with IT security practices that protect sensitive information against data loss or theft. The findings were presented to the Legislative Post Audit Committee in an executive session and published online. The audit division studied IT functions at agencies from January 2017 to December 2019. Most agencies failed to scan and patch computers to keep them secure. They didn’t have adequate response plans and didn’t encrypt, back up or destroy electronic data. The report blamed a lack of management attention and inadequate resources for the failures.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear spoke at an LGBTQ-rights rally in the Capitol on Wednesday, advocating for a statewide fairness law and a bill banning “conversion therapy.” “Kentucky cannot reach its full potential if all of our people don’t feel supported to be themselves,” Beshear said. “Discrimination against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters is absolutely unacceptable in this commonwealth.” The rally, held by the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign every legislative session, featured activists and legislators advocating for those bills and against a slew of bills targeting transgender youth. Beshear threw his support behind legislation banning discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, which has failed to pass either chamber in each legislative session over the past decade.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A month after delaying a decision, the state’s higher education policy-making board voted Wednesday to bolster its minimum admission standards for public universities by adding the threat of financial penalties for campuses that disobey the requirements. The Board of Regents approved the adjustments to the state’s existing, 15-year-old admissions standards without objection, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations to get board members comfortable with the changes. Most of the rewrites were modest. But the penalty provisions represent the first real effort to force compliance with the policy. The board has never penalized schools for not complying with admissions criteria. Still, financial penalties won’t be automatic for campuses that violate the admissions criteria, and the threat of reduced funding doesn’t come unless a school has breached the policy for two consecutive years.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Lobsters have long delighted tourists as the state’s most beloved seafood. But one company thinks the crustaceans can save human lives by providing their blood for use in new drugs. The company working on the lobster blood project, Lobster Unlimited of Orono, is investigating whether lobster blood can be used as a potential weapon against viruses and cancer. Representatives with the company said results are promising – the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued them a patent in late October related to their work. The blood is easy to come by because it’s a byproduct of lobster processing, company head Robert Bayer said. Lobster blood is likely a long way from playing a role in new drugs, Bayer said, but there’s “no question it has antiviral and anticancer properties” based on research needed to apply for the patent. “Right now, this blood is literally thrown out on the floor and goes down the drain,” said Bayer, a professor emeritus of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at University of Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined Wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. The legislation would increase the state’s current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. It also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Supporters of the “Climate Solutions Act of 2020” say Maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. Environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a Legislature controlled by Democrats. The measure’s goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. It also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nChicopee: A former police sergeant accused of lying about his role in sharing pictures of a homicide victim has been reinstated to the department. The state Civil Service Commission voted to allow Jeffrey Godere to return to the Chicopee Police Department at a lower rank after winning an appeal of his termination, MassLive.com reports. Godere was fired by then-Mayor Richard Kos in November 2018 after he and three other officers were implicated in sharing images of a victim’s body and the crime scene in the 2011 killing of 20-year-old Amanda Plasse. The commission ruled last week that Godere would be demoted to patrolman because of his misconduct and prior disciplinary record. City officials and the police department are reviewing the commission’s decision with lawyers and exploring options to appeal it in superior court, according to Michael Wilk, public information officer.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Marijuana will have to carry labels warning pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers about the health risks for their fetuses and infants under newly enacted state laws. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist signed the two bills Wednesday because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was out of the state. The labels must be placed on legal recreational and medical marijuana products and warn that use by pregnant or breastfeeding women may result in fetal injury, preterm birth, low birth weight or development problems for children. The laws also require that an informational pamphlet be made available at every point of sale. It must include safety information related to use by minors and include the poison control hotline number – in case children accidentally eat candy or brownies that contain marijuana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBecker: Firefighters battled a stubborn fire at a metal recycling plant in this small community for a third consecutive day Thursday. The fire at the Northern Metals plant in Becker was unleashing noxious, billowing smoke, and the wind had shifted direction, prompting school officials to cancel classes for the day. Firefighters from around the region continued to work the blaze in the Sherburne County city about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. In a Facebook update late Wednesday, the Becker Police Department said the fire could last several more days. Firefighting crews were using heavy equipment to separate a portion of a burning stack of vehicles in hopes that the blaze would eventually die out. The strategy was intended to protect nearby buildings.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Replicas of Christopher Columbus’ Nina and Pinta have arrived along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast, sailing into a Biloxi harbor as spectators aimed their phones out to the horizon. About a dozen spectators lined a pier Wednesday as the ships arrived. Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic on the Nina on his three voyages of discovery to the New World beginning in 1492. He was long celebrated in the U.S., but in recent years a reckoning has been held with the brutal aspects of his legacy. Columbus’ arrival brought violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation to the native people. The original Nina was last heard from in 1501, but this replica, finished in 1991, serves as a floating museum. It was built entirely by hand, without the use of power tools, and is considered the most historically accurate Columbus ship replica ever built. The Pinta replica was built in Brazil and launched in 2005 to accompany the Nina on travels. While in port, the ships will be open for public tours. They are scheduled to leave Biloxi on March 2.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo announced Thursday that it has a new resident in Teak, a black and white colobus monkey born Feb. 3. Colobus monkeys are born white with a pink face. By age 6 months, the little monkey will get his adult coloration – mostly black hair but with white hair around the face and part of the tail, though adults also have a distinctive mantle of long white hair from their shoulders around the edge of their backs. Colobus monkeys live in families with several females sharing in the care of newborns, a behavior called allomothering. Teak’s mother, Cecelia, has raised five babies of her own along with three other babies in the family, the zoo said. Teak’s father, Kima, watches over the family and often interacts with the youngsters, the zoo said. Teak’s sister and his half-sister also interact with and help care for Teak. The monkeys, also known as Guereza colobus, are native to east and central Africa.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame officials say they are saddling up with the C.M. Russell Museum on an inaugural exhibit within the internationally known museum in Great Falls that will add to the celebration of the American West. The exhibit, a two-year pilot project planned to open in September, would be a blend of Cowboy Hall of Fame honorees and their history. Efforts are underway to curate the specific content for the initial exhibit, Cowboy Hall of Fame board member Mike Gurnett said at a Feb. 7-8 meeting. The exhibit in Great Falls gives something of a foothold for the hall of fame. The Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame, established by the Legislature, has spent nearly 17 years looking for a permanent home after an effort failed in Big Timber. Earlier attempts in Wolf Point and other communities never came to fruition.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state senator who is pushing the Legislature’s main bill to lower property taxes says she hopes to reach a deal with opponents who are trying to derail it out of concern that it could hurt the state’s K-12 public schools. Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, of Omaha, said Thursday that she and other senators will try to find an agreement with school officials who are lobbying against the measure. The bill has won support from farm and business groups and Gov. Pete Ricketts because it would lower taxes that have risen over the past decade. But school administrators, school boards and the state teachers’ union argue it would hinder their long-term spending flexibility. “This bill is bad for Nebraska, and it’s bad for our kids,” said Sen. Wendy DeBoer, of Bennington, who opposed the measure. The bill would boost state aid to schools by about $520 million over three years and redistribute it so that smaller, rural schools get a larger increase.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Virgin Trains Las Vegas has released plans to build a proposed train station near the South Premium Outlets mall south of the Strip. The $4.8 billion high-speed rail link with Southern California would be two stories tall and span more than 273,000 square feet, with a seven-story-tall parking garage, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, according to planning documents submitted to Clark County. Operations are scheduled to begin in 2023. Plans call for the two-story station to include a self-ticketing area, departure lobby, retail space, baggage claim, office space, passenger waiting areas and security. Plans also include a parking garage that would connect to the train terminal and have more than 2,600 parking spaces. The project would be designed to provide easier access to California, while also providing thousands of jobs and opportunities in the area, company officials said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCroydon: The police chief took it literally when he was stripped of his duties at a local board meeting, disrobing to his underwear and walking out into a snowstorm. Richard Lee has been chief in the small town of Croydon for 20 years. On Tuesday night, the three-member selectboard voted to eliminate the one-man department and move to 100% coverage by the New Hampshire State Police. Lee, who was at the meeting, was told to turn in the key to his cruiser, his guns and his uniform – immediately. He went into an office he shared with town officials and took off his clothes before the board chairman. “I gave them my uniform shirt. I gave them my turtleneck. I gave them my ballistic vest. … I sat down in the chair, took off my boots, took off my pants, put those in the chair and put my boots back on, and walked out the door,” Lee said. He didn’t have spare clothes or a ride home. He walked nearly a mile before his wife picked him up.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEgg Harbor Township: A Superior Court judge has denied a neighborhood’s attempt to leave the township and join a neighboring borough. Judge Julio Mendez ruled that Egg Harbor Township’s refusal to allow Seaview Harbor residents to join Longport was “not arbitrary or unreasonable.” The township argued against the move, declaring that it would harm the township economically and socially and benefit the homeowners only economically, the Press of Atlantic City reports. The homeowners stood to pay significantly less in property taxes in Longport, which does not have a school system. Mendez said court decisions have not favored de-annexation for “tax shopping.” Mendez’s opinion said the township stood to lose over $500,000 a year in municipal tax revenue and $1.8 million in revenue to township schools. The average homeowner would save almost $18,000 a year in property taxes, based on 2015 numbers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A conservation group is calling on members of the state’s congressional delegation to rethink proposed legislation that would change the designation of Bandelier National Monument to a national park. While one of the goals is to attract more tourists to the region with the “national park” brand, the nonprofit group Caldera Action said Bandelier would not be able to cope with additional crowding because of inadequate and crumbling infrastructure and limited staffing. The group also is worried about opening up part of Bandelier to hunting and trapping, saying there are other locations throughout the Jemez Mountains that already allow for hunting, and doing so at Bandelier would complicate management for the National Park Service. Tucked into northern New Mexico’s ancient canyons, Bandelier has a long history that stretches back more than 11,000 years to the days when nomadic hunters and gatherers tracked wildlife across the region’s mesas and canyons. Grand multistory structures were built into the walls of Frijoles Canyon and along Frijoles Creek centuries ago, but all that remains are stone and mortar outlines of the settlements.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Animal rights advocates have lost a bid to get a Bronx Zoo elephant declared to have human-like rights and transferred to a sanctuary, though a judge said the case for sending the pachyderm to a sanctuary was “extremely persuasive.” Bronx Judge Alison Tuitt on Tuesday dismissed the Nonhuman Rights Project’s petition arguing that Happy the elephant is “unlawfully imprisoned” at the zoo where she has lived since 1977. She has been kept separate from other elephants for more than a decade. New York courts have previously said animals aren’t legally considered “persons,” and Tuitt said those rulings applied to Happy, too. But the judge said she was “extremely sympathetic to Happy’s plight.” “This court agrees that Happy is more than just a legal thing, or property. She is an intelligent, autonomous being who should be treated with respect and dignity, and who may be entitled to liberty,” the judge wrote, calling the arguments for transferring Happy from her “lonely” exhibit to a sprawling elephant sanctuary “extremely persuasive.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A free downtown music and arts festival that organizers say draws 30,000 locals and tourists may be canceled this summer. LEAF Downtown AVL official Ehren Cruz has said the sixth annual festival scheduled for Aug. 7-8 until 10 p.m. at Pack Square Park may not happen, after organizers were asked to have equipment and gear removed by early Aug. 9, Cruz said. The downtown event is different from LEAF’s main festival, which happens at Lake Eden outside Black Mountain. LEAF, a nonprofit focused on arts and cultural enrichment, would have to pay subcontractors to work overtime overnight, including the staging company, tent suppliers and an “environmental green team,” Cruz said. That would cost $6,000-$10,000 and isn’t possible considering the limited revenue the festival brings in, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators on Wednesday unanimously approved expanded capacity for the Dakota Access pipeline, saying they believed the project had met exhaustive state and federal requirements. The 3-0 vote by the all-Republican Public Service Commission came after the body signaled last month that it was likely to approve a permit to expand the capacity of the pipeline, despite objections from opponents who said it would increase the probability of a disastrous oil spill. Commissioners said they expect their decision to be challenged in state court. Commissioner Julie Fedorchak said she welcomed such a review. Texas-based Energy Transfer proposed doubling the capacity of the pipeline last year to meet growing demand for oil shipments from North Dakota, without the need for additional pipelines or rail shipments. Commissioner Brian Kroshus said Wednesday that he believes the project would help take oil trucks off the road, reducing traffic fatalities.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday presented the state’s highest non-combat decoration for service to a retired fighter pilot and astronaut. Col. Guion Bluford of Westlake in suburban Cleveland flew 144 combat missions in South Vietnam with the U.S. Air Force and later earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. In 1983, Bluford became the first black astronaut to fly in space on a shuttle mission. DeWine presented the 77-year-old Bluford with the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal at a Statehouse ceremony. Bluford, who was honored on the 58th anniversary of fellow Ohioan John Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, attributed his success to chasing his dreams and advised others to do the same by figuring out “what gets you excited.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state House committee overwhelmingly rejected a bill Thursday to repeal a new law that allows most adults to carry firearms without a background check or training. Despite the 11-1 vote against his bill by the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Jason Lowe, an Oklahoma City Democrat, vowed to continue fighting the law with a signature-gathering effort to put a question on the ballot to repeal it. “I believe this law is absolutely dangerous,” Lowe said. “It’s a ticking time bomb, and it’s been an absolute disaster.” Dubbed permitless carry by its opponents, the new law allows most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without a license. It was the first measure signed into law by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and took effect in November. Oklahoma’s Republican-led Legislature has embraced numerous bills that expand gun rights in the state. The committee on Thursday approved a bill to expand the state’s “Stand Your Ground” law. Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would allow more public school teachers to carry firearms in their classrooms.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Department of Land Conservation and Development says a proposed liquefied natural gas export terminal in Coos Bay would have significant adverse effects on the state’s coastal scenic and aesthetic resources, endangered species and critical habitat. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in a letter Wednesday to backers of the Jordan Cove Energy Project, agency director Jim Rue said that neither the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nor the Army Corps of Engineers “can grant a license or permit for this project unless the U.S. Secretary of Commerce overrides this objection on appeal. The decision on one of the key state permits for the project is a rebuke that comes just before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final environmental analysis on the project, approving or denying its primary federal license.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As many of the state’s counties adopt new hand-marked ballot voting systems, a persistent criticism is a perceived loss of privacy in polling places when filling them out and scanning them. The criticism, raised again Wednesday by state lawmakers, has emerged repeatedly ahead of the presidential elections, after a two-year push by Gov. Tom Wolf to get counties to switch to paper-based voting systems as an election security bulwark against hacking. Some lawmakers say they have heard from unhappy voters accustomed to electronic touchscreen voting machines that, in the past, had been screened off or arranged to allow voters to make selections unseen. Now, other voters or poll workers may be able to see how someone voted while they are filling out their ballot or while they feed their ballot into an electronic scanner that reads it. “I think we’re disenfranchising so many voters who don’t like the new system,” Rep. Doyle Heffley, R-Carbon, told top state election officials at an Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday. “It’s not a secret ballot. Other people can see how they vote.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The University of Rhode Island is using a $1 million federal grant to offer education and training about opioids to residents in rural areas of the state. Officials with the university in South Kingstown say health professionals and students have been preparing to start the outreach campaign. Funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be used to send students and staff to farmers markets, fairs, festivals and other events to discuss issues related to opioids, hand out information about how to obtain overdose-reversal medication and offer related health counseling. Deborah Sheely, of URI’s Cooperative Extension, says the goal is to remove the stigma associated with opioid misuse and ensure that residents in rural areas have the information and technical assistance they need.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Columbia Housing Authority was fined just under $11,000 after pleading guilty Wednesday to 24 safety violations found after two residents died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly maintained heater. One code violation was dropped as city officials appeared in court, and they asked for a jury trial on one other violation, WLTX-TV reports. The violations included broken smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers, as well as failing to do routine maintenance. Calvin Witherspoon Jr., 62, and Derrick Roper, 31, died in separate units in the same building in January 2019 at Allen Benedict Court in Columbia. Investigators immediately inspected all 244 of the units at the 80-year-old complex and found hundreds of problems missed as employees in the Housing Authority’s maintenance department either retired or left and weren’t replaced, authorities said. Prosecutors said they could not file criminal charges because South Carolina lacks a criminal negligence law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Legislation to prevent the spread of zebra mussels is headed for the state Senate after it received unanimous approval from the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday. The bill, which has already passed the House, requires people to decontaminate their boats by cleaning and draining them after leaving the water. It also creates inspection stations. Senators were told the invasive species has now been found in four South Dakota lakes. Zebra mussels can cause a foul taste and smell in drinking water, increase algae and alter aquatic food chains. The widespread invasive species wasn’t found in South Dakota until 2016, when the zebra mussels were discovered in Lewis and Clark Lake and McCook Lake. It was found to have spread to Sharpe and Francis Case lakes last year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state panel won’t vote on whether to remove or add context to a bust of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader in the Capitol until a board vacancy is filled, the board’s chairman said at a meeting Thursday. Finance Commissioner and Capitol Commission Chairman Stuart McWhorter said he’s unsure when Gov. Bill Lee will replace Tyreece Miller, who recently left the commission as the nominee for U.S. marshal in western Tennessee. McWhorter said he doesn’t want to act on Nathan Bedford Forrest’s bust before Miller is replaced. The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act also requires the state Historical Commission’s approval to remove the bust. Forrest amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis. After the war, he was a leader of the Klan, which terrorized black people as it sought to reverse Reconstruction efforts and restore white supremacy.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The state will close two of its more than 100 state prisons amid a years­long decline in the incarcerated population and serious understaffing at some facilities, officials said Thursday. The closures of a prison in South Texas and another in suburban Houston will result in annual savings of about $20 million, according to the office of state Sen. John Whitmire, who heads the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. The Garza East Transfer Facility in Beeville, 100 miles southeast of San Antonio, is set to close in May, but a date has not been set for the closure of the Jester I Unit in Sugar Land, according to Whitmire’s chief of staff, Lara Wendler. She said both prisons were at more than 90% population capacity as of Thursday, and those inmates will be transferred to other prisons.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University has revised its strict code of conduct to strip a rule that banned any behavior that reflected “homosexual feelings,” which LGBTQ students and their allies felt created an unfair double standard not imposed on heterosexual couples. The university is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which teaches its members that being gay isn’t a sin, but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. BYU’s revisions to what the college calls its honor code don’t change the faith’s opposition to same-sex relationships or gay marriage. The changes were discovered by media outlets Wednesday. BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said in an email that the updated version of the code aligns with a new handbook of rules unveiled by the faith, widely known as the Mormon church.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A panel formed to review community policing practices in the city has recommended changes to the police department’s use-of-force policy, with a focus on de-escalating potential physical confrontations. The 15-member committee, which released its report this month, also advises improving civilian oversight of police, Vermont Public Radio reports. The City Council formed the panel in June following several interactions in which officers allegedly used excessive force. The council told the committee to focus on the police department’s use-of-force policy and the police commission. Committee Chair Randall Harp told the council Tuesday that the panel advises making de-escalation a priority in the use-of-force policy. “And emphasize that officer behavior can escalate the level of force required, and it sanctions officers that do so,” he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMount Vernon: George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate says it will no longer sell a souvenir depicting the founding father’s false teeth amid criticism that Washington’s dentures were made with teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves. Critics said selling a souvenir magnet depicting Washington’s famous false teeth trivialized the fact that Washington’s slaves had to give up their own teeth. On Wednesday, Mount Vernon said on Twitter that it would remove the magnet from its online store. The webpage on which the magnet had been offered for sale was disabled as of Wednesday afternoon. The old story that Washington’s dentures were made of wood has long been known to be false. It has been known for years that Washington paid about six pounds for nine teeth that were pulled from slaves’ mouths. The payment is recorded in a 1784 ledger. The fact has received renewed attention following publication of a revisionist biography.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Bills that would have limited how many rounds can be stored in gun magazines and what guns can be sold failed to make their way through the Legislature. KING-TV reports neither bill was approved before Wednesday’s 5 p.m. deadline. Lawmakers knew earlier this month that the proposed ban on firearms defined as assault weapons did not have the votes to proceed. The high-capacity limit bill passed out of House and Senate committees but never came up on the floor for debate. Republicans opposed to the bill filed an unusually high number of amendments on the bill, meaning debate could last a day or more, according to Democratic staffers. Aberdeen Republican Rep. Jim Walsh, who submitted six amendments, was asked if the long list of amendments was a political ploy to prevent debate. “That’s part of it,” said Walsh. “But it’s also a very bad policy.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents may soon get more money for adopting children under a measure passed by the House of Delegates this week aimed at alleviating the state’s overburdened foster care system. Delegates voted 96-1 to approve the bill, with Republican Del. Pat McGeehan as the lone “no” vote after he was told the measure would cost the state about $17 million. “Great emphasis has been placed on the projected cost of this bill, but we must acknowledge that this is an investment, an investment in West Virginia children,” said Del. Jason Barrett, a Berkeley County Democrat. The proposal, sent to the Senate, would give families at least $900 a month for each child adopted. Child placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption. The bill also establishes a foster care bill of rights, which would ensure children and parents understand their rights in the state’s foster system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A group monitoring a legal settlement over the Milwaukee Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices reports officers failed to document a justification in 80% of such incidents in the first half of 2019. The Crime and Justice Institute found many of the officers’ report narratives lacked the details necessary to establish reasonable suspicion that the people being frisked were armed or dangerous to others around them. The Boston-based institute is monitoring the police department’s compliance as part of a $3.4 million settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin in 2018 over stop-and-frisk practices. The ACLU had argued in its lawsuit that over the past decade, tens of thousands of minority residents in Milwaukee have been stopped by police without reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Environmental groups are suing over plans for a potentially huge gas field they say would endanger antelope in Grand Teton National Park by hindering a migration route between the park and a basin. The Upper Green River Alliance, Western Watersheds Project and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne on Wednesday. The groups say the agency insufficiently took into account a 170-mile pronghorn antelope migration corridor between Grand Teton and the Upper Green River Basin before approving a plan to develop the Normally Pressured Lance gas field in the basin in 2018. The Jonah Energy project would potentially add 350 gas wells a year to the gas field over a decade. With 3,500 wells, the Normally Pressured Lance field could become one of the biggest onshore gas fields in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/21"}]}

David Cameron’s long-term economic plan. Take back control. Get Brexit done. For the many, not the few,” argued Red Box editor Patrick Maguire, in The Times.\n\nIn his three years as Labour leader, Starmer has cycled through no less than 12: “In September he promised a ‘fairer, greener future’; three months earlier he was ‘on your side’”, said Maguire. “In January 2022 his watchwords were ‘security, prosperity, respect’; which you shouldn’t confuse with the four he stressed in his 2021 conference speech: ‘Work, care, equality, security’.”\n\n“I could keep going,” wrote Maguire, “but you follow my argument: Labour isn’t making one”.\n\nAnd four years on from the 2019 general election campaign – one in which former leader Jeremy Corbyn also struggled to settle on a slogan – “the leadership of the Labour Party disagrees with itself almost as profoundly” as it did then, said Maguire. “Yet still it staggers on towards government. Now there’s a slogan to sum up Starmerism,” he added.\n\n‘Magpie Conservatives are following Labour’s lead’\n\nBut Starmer may still be having an effect, at least on the opposition with the “magpie” Conservatives having now long taken their lead from the Labour Party, argued Jamie Grierson in The Guardian. The opposition had been calling for a “windfall tax” for months before then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the “energy profits levy” in May. “Perhaps the chancellor’s choice of words was to avoid the inevitable suggestion that his government had poached the policy from Labour,” said Grierson.\n\nAnd more recently, the Conservatives have “copied a Labour proposal almost word for word” when they announced a policy promising to “make the right to request flexible working a day-one right” – a policy Labour had proposed in July 2021, said columnist Andy Beckett, also in The Guardian.\n\n“Gradual transitions between a fading government and its likely replacement actually happen quite often in Britain,” said Beckett, noting that “in the 1970s, Jim Callaghan’s Labour administration adopted monetarist economic policies before Margaret Thatcher did,” while “John Major’s optimistic talk of ‘a classless society’ anticipated Tony Blair’s attempt to make Britain into a meritocracy.”\n\nThe period leading up to the next election is likely to be an “acrimonious” one, as the two parties fight for votes from the electorate, added Beckett. “When fading governments steal ideas from their opponents, it’s usually a sign that their diehards will do anything to stay in power.”", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961267/three-by-elections-rishi-sunak", "title": "Mid Bedfordshire, Uxbridge and Selby and Ainsty: the three by ...", "text": "Rishi Sunak is facing three “highly problematic” by-elections in Conservative-held seats this summer after the resignation of Boris Johnson and two of his key allies.\n\nThe former prime minister and MP for Uxbridge & South Ruislip resigned on Friday over the findings of an investigation into Downing Street parties held during national lockdowns.\n\nJohnson’s loyal supporter Nadine Dorries quickly followed, announcing her intention to stand down as MP for Mid Bedfordshire with immediate effect – but the former culture secretary has yet to formally resign.

So there will be a further by-election in Somerton & Frome, a former Liberal Democrat seat won by Warburton in 2019 with a 19,000 majority.\n\nWhen will the by-elections take place?\n\nThe elections to replace Johnson and Adams will take place on 20 July. Sunak had “hoped to limit the political damage” by holding the Mid Bedfordshire by-election on the same day but Dorries appears determined to make the PM “sweat” by refusing to resign until “the moment of her choosing”, said the Financial Times (FT). “She might want to mess up Rishi’s holidays,” suggested one Tory MP.\n\nThe PM is facing a “summer crunch”, said the Daily Mail, with “the Tories desperately struggling to cling on in the seats”.\n\nWho might win?\n\nLabour, who were 16 points ahead of the Tories in the latest “poll of polls” on Politico, are “going for the treble” and standing candidates in all three constituencies triggered by Johnson quitting, despite the Lib Dems pushing to be the “main anti-Conservative option” in Mid Bedfordshire, a senior Labour source told The Times.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe party will be “vying with the Liberal Democrats” for Dorries’ seat after it finished a “distant” second in the constituency at the 2019 general election – 25,000 votes behind Dorries. The Lib Dems came an even more distant third.\n\nProjections show that the Tories could retain Mid Bedfordshire, said The Telegraph, but with a “vastly reduced” majority of just 2.5%, down from a 38% margin in 2019.\n\nUxbridge & South Ruislip is “by far the most marginal” seat, said The Times, with Johnson winning the seat by a majority of 7,210 votes in 2019. Labour has already selected 34-year-old local councillor Danny Beales as its candidate. Polling expert John Curtice told The Telegraph that the seat is a “lost cause” for the Tories, noting Labour would require only a 7% swing to win there.\n\nLabour face a bigger challenge in Selby & Ainsty in North Yorkshire. The Conservatives will be defending a large majority – Adams beat his Labour rival by more than 20,000 votes in 2019. But a Labour win in the Conservative stronghold would be seen as a sign that Keir Starmer “is on course for a similarly dominant electoral performance”.\n\nWhat does it mean for Sunak?\n\nThe prime minister and his party, facing criticism on multiple fronts, face four major electoral tests in the coming weeks. And the nature of Johnson’s exit is “likely to remind voters of the parliamentary chaos that dominated much of last year”, said the Big Issue.\n\nDorries’ resignation delay will only “sow unrest” in the Conservative parliamentary party, pushing what is likely to be a “difficult” by-election into the autumn and close to the Conservative Party conference, said The Independent. Sunak has criticised the delay, describing it as “unusual” and said that Dorries’ constituents deserve “proper representation”.\n\nBut while the “undignified squabble” of the past few days is “mainly a disaster” for the Conservatives, it could provide Sunak with a “glimmer” of an opportunity, said Daniel Finkelstein in The Times.\n\nThe nature of Johnson’s departure has “removed from the prime minister the obligation of pretending that he and Johnson are in harmony”. While there has long been warfare between the two, “now the warfare is open”, allowing Sunak to “say what he really thinks about his predecessor”.\n\nThere is a scenario in which Sunak and the Conservatives could emerge from the by-elections “stronger than ever”, suggested ITV’s political correspondent Harry Horton. Mid Bedfordshire and Selby & Ainsty are “comfortable ground” for the Conservatives, thanks to their large majorities. If the Tories were to pick an anti-Ulez [Ultra Low Emission Zone, which is being extended this summer to cover the whole of London] candidate in Uxbridge & South Ruislip, then it’s “not inconceivable” that the by-election would be seen as a de facto referendum on Ulez, a subject which is “much trickier territory for Labour”.\n\nIf the Tories can “cling on” in Johnson’s former seat while keeping Mid Bedfordshire and Selby & Ainsty blue, Sunak is likely to head into the autumn with “renewed confidence” ahead of the general election.\n\nBut a win for Labour in Uxbridge & South Ruislip – or significant inroads from Labour or the Lib Dems in the other three seats including Somerton & Frome – will leave Sunak “under yet more pressure” and only “extend the gloomy mood already prevalent among many Tory MPs”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/20"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961251/keir-starmers-transformation-of-the-labour-party", "title": "Keir Starmer's transformation of the Labour Party | The Week", "text": "In 2019 the Labour Party faced its worst electoral defeat in over 80 years – now the party could be looking at victory in the next general election.\n\nWhen Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecution, was elected leader in 2020, the Labour Party stood at a crossroads after enduring four consecutive election defeats.\n\nPromising to unite the party and bring about a much-needed transformation in its fortunes, Starmer “basically said he would be Jeremy Corbyn in a suit without the IRA stuff or Palestine obsession”, one former party aide told the Financial Times (FT).\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nBut three years on from his election as leader, Starmer has “carried out a radical realignment” of the Labour Party, said the FT, having “sidelined the left, taken over the machinery of the party and driven it on to the political ground he thinks can win an election”.\n\nConsolidation of power\n\nOne of Starmer’s first steps has been to “nurture a new model army of backbenchers”, said The Spectator’s political editor Katy Balls. His team have made it his business to know the politics of local Labour branches and selection for the first 100 Labour target seats “has been more tightly controlled than at any previous point in the party’s history”, said Balls.\n\nThe Labour leader has purged candidates suspected of holding radical left views and assembled a list of centrist or “ideological” candidates to run for the next general election. Most notably, the left-wing mayor of North of Tyne, Jamie Driscoll, was last week blocked from standing for re-election, in a move linked to his appearance on stage with film director Ken Loach, who was expelled from the party in 2021.\n\nBanning Driscoll from re-election shows that Labour is “acting like a narrow clique with no respect for the party’s pluralist traditions”, said Jon Trickett, MP for Hemsworth, writing for Tribune. Not only are the reasons for doing so “spurious”, argued Trickett, but “a Blackfriars-based clique determining who can or cannot stand for the party in the North is a profound mistake” and will do little to win back key communities in the north of England.\n\nMany of the new faces waiting to take the place of those purged “look almost like a Blairite and Brownite restoration”, said The Spectator’s Balls, citing Douglas Alexander, a former New Labour minister, and Emma Reynolds, a Blair-era special adviser. Plus as the moderates return, the “money is close behind them”, she said. “Bankrolling the Starmerarmy are many Blairites from the past: Waheed Alli as Labour’s head of election fundraising, with Lords Sainsbury and Levy back in the fold.”\n\nRevamped policy agenda\n\nStarmer has made radical policy changes since first running for the leadership. Initially making 10 pledges that largely aligned with the Corbynite agenda – still available on Keir Starmer’s website – these included pledges to abolish tuition fees, keep public services in public hands, a higher income tax for the top 5%, and a commitment to “unite our party.” But Starmer has since distanced himself from many of these promises.\n\nThe Labour leader has since said the party is “likely to move on from that commitment” on tuition fees. And on privatised utilities, he has been quoted as saying the way to move forward is “going to lie in regulating the market, changing the market, rather than simply taking things into public ownership”. Of course, when it comes to policy decisions, “Starmer’s audience has changed: a Corbyn-era party membership during the campaign, and the wider electorate now”, said Archie Bland of The Guardian’s First Edition newsletter. But it has led many both inside and outside the party “to question whether he ever meant what he originally said”.\n\nLabour’s Starmer-led policy trajectory has shown similarities to some of the popular policies championed by Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party, said Patrick Maguire for The Times Red Box. In 2020, Johnson was promising “to do better: to reform our system of government, to renew our infrastructure; to spread opportunity more widely and fairly and to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery that’s led not by the state but by free enterprise”, and had announced plans for a £12 billion “green industrial revolution”, powered by provincial industry.\n\nAnd all of this, “give or take the emphasis on the role of the state, we have since heard from Starmer and Reeves”, said Maguire. Indeed, Starmer’s confidants seem to “embrace” the comparison, with one telling Maguire: “Which party’s manifesto will look most like the 2016 Vote Leave and 2019 Tory offer? It’s ours.”\n\nYet a Labour victory is still far from assured, said Yasmeen Serhan for Time. Few Britons “appear to know who he is or what he stands for”, while he is “dogged by perceptions that he is wooden, distant, and even a bit boring”. Overall, he is yet to convince British voters that “Labour has what it takes to bring Britain back from the brink”.\n\nKing in the north\n\nBut Starmer’s fortunes have been significantly boosted by recent developments on the political scene, said Stephen Bush in the FT.\n\nThe departure of Boris Johnson and his allies from parliament, as well as the crisis facing the Scottish National Party – following the arrest and the subsequent release without charge of former leader Nicola Sturgeon – is ultimately “good news” for Labour.\n\nThe absence of Johnson allows more attention to be focused on the “crises engulfing both Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, and creates two eminently winnable by-elections for his party”. Meanwhile, the challenges faced by the SNP make it easier for Labour to achieve a parliamentary majority “both numerically and politically”. “The big picture of all this is simple, I think: Keir Starmer is going to become prime minister,” said Bush.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/05/uk-election-results-2024-keir-starmer-wins/74278218007/", "title": "Keir Starmer is Britain's 'boring' new Labour prime minister", "text": "LONDON − The backdrop was noticeably light on celebratory Union Jack flag-waving.

Labour secured its biggest parliamentary majority since Tony Blair's prime ministerial days a quarter of a century ago. A government viewed by many Britons as hectic and incompetent − all rhetoric, no policy − was shown the door.\n\nFive consecutive Conservative prime ministers, capped off with Rishi Sunak, was apparently more than enough for a nation where leadership of late has been an overcaffeinated (or more) revolving door.\n\nStarmer is the country's fourth prime minister in less than two years.\n\n\"Now we can look forward. And walk into the morning,\" Starmer said under the glare of the cameras at 5 a.m. as he promised to work for better times in Britain. \"The sunlight of hope, pale at first, but getting stronger through the day, shining once again on a country with the opportunity, after 14 years, to get its future back.\"\n\nU.K. voters punish Conservatives:Keir Starmer's Labour Party wins election landslide\n\nWhile Starmer spoke inside about the possibility of sunlit uplands, outside it threatened rain, a reminder that Britain is, for quite a lot of people, what the opinion columnist Andrew Marr said of his country in a piece for The New Statesman magazine: \"beaten-down, demoralized and (in a) rackety condition.\"\n\nThere's a lot to do.\n\nDespite 14 years in government, economists say, the Conservatives failed to achieve any notable economic growth. A cavalier pledge to take Britain out of the European Union to \"take back control\" over immigration failed spectacularly. Arrivals are now higher than before Brexit, as that geopolitical divorce is known. The nation's welfare services are struggling. There are not enough teachers. The prison system is a mess. The public feels drained by scandal and division. Few in the working and middles classes feel buoyant about their prospects.\n\n\"The country is in a complete and utter state, and people haven't been up front about it,\" said Baroness Louise Casey, a former British official who has advised Labour and Conservative governments on social welfare issues as well as police reform. Casey spoke at an election night event Thursday night at King's College London. She is a member of the House of Lords, Britain's unelected second chamber, which scrutinizes legislation.\n\nA comparison to when Labour last won a landslide, the 1997 election that ushered in Blair's time in office, could not be more high-contrast. “A new dawn has broken, has it not?\" Blair said chirpily, addressing a cheering crowd of supporters as the sun rose over London, after he won that vote for Labour.\n\n'Sir' Keir Starmer:Meet U.K.'s newest prime minister\n\nThen, too, more than a decade of Conservative rule in Britain was coming to a sudden, sharp end. Overnight, Britain's political landscape was transformed. Blair's was the largest majority of any Labour government ever. A record six Conservative cabinet members, all party grandees, lost their seats.\n\nWithin months, the country changed in ways big and small: Hong Kong sovereignty was transferred back to China. Important steps were taken that led to the Good Friday Agreement − peace in Northern Ireland. The first of author J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books was published. Private gun ownership was banned almost entirely after a school shooting in Dunblane, Scotland. Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris.\n\nBut unlike now, Britain's economy 27 years ago was booming. Its deregulated financial markets were the envy of Europe. Employment was on the rise. The worker strikes that had dominated Margaret Thatcher's tenure as the Conservatives sold off nationalized coal and steel industries to private owners were a distant memory.\n\nBlair was boisterous and kinetic. Starmer is managerial and gray.\n\nStill, Starmer, a bespectacled 61-year-old former human rights lawyer whose oratory provokes more drowsiness than hope, more may be just what Britain needs, according to political scientists and former officials.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson:Not even he can save Britain's ruling Conservative party\n\n\"What do we want? We want boring. When do we want it? We want it now. It's a very British type of regime-change,\" said Richard Whitman, a professor of politics at the University of Kent.\n\nWhitman said that after years of Conservative governments under colorful but chaotic leaders such as Boris Johnson, Britons were tired of political \"soap operas.\" He said they were \"sort of yearning for basic political competence from politicians who just get on with the business of governance without squandering resources.\"\n\nPeter Hain, who served in various Blair cabinets and is now a member of the House of Lords, said Starmer's hyper-disciplined political style and personality may not quicken the pulse.\n\n\"But I think people across the political parties are pretty sick of excitement. A government that brings a bit of stability and common sense to our national affairs, instead of wild oscillations, will help confidence.\"\n\nStarmer himself appears to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"We will rebuild Britain,\" he said in his first speech outside No. 10 Downing Street, his official office and residence, on Friday afternoon after he formally became prime minister. He did so after being invited to form a government by King Charles in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace known as the \"kissing of the hands.\"\n\n\"You have given us a clear mandate,\" he said, addressing the British nation. \"We will use it to deliver change, restore service and respect to politics, and end the era of noisy performance.\"\n\nStarmer would, he said, \"navigate\" Britain toward \"calmer waters.\"\n\nHe may get an assist from continuity, of the feline variety.\n\nAfter more than a decade as \"Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office,\" Larry the cat, a 16-year-old tabby who is cared for by staff at No. 10 Downing Street, could been seen wandering the grounds near Starmer's new office Friday. His tenure has endured longer than any recent prime minister. Starmer is his sixth. In fact, in the run-up to the vote, surveys showed, Larry had a much higher \"favorability\" ranking than Sunak or Starmer.\n\nLarry stays even if Starmer goes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/05"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961963/tony-blair-keir-starmer-labour", "title": "Does Tony Blair hold the answers for Keir Starmer? | The Week", "text": "Keir Starmer’s appearance at Tony Blair’s Future of Britain conference has been heralded by commentators as the political rehabilitation of Labour’s three-time election winner and an indication of the style of politics that may be on the way if Starmer wins the next general election.\n\nThe current and former Labour Party leaders joined one another on stage last month at the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge Hotel, just across the river from the Houses of Parliament, for what Politico called a “cosy chat”, which ended with the pair “congratulating each other on what a good job each had done”.\n\nIf Starmer is victorious, Blair “stands ready to be one of his successor’s most important sources of inspiration”, said Mario Ledwith and Patrick Maguire in The Times.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThe pair “talk regularly in private” but Starmer’s outing with the New Labour pioneer “sent out the clearest signal yet to his unified version of the party that Blairism need no longer be seen as taboo”, they added.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nLabour “can smell power now”, said The Sun’s Tony Parsons. “So it was fitting that Tony Blair chose to rise from his crypt and bestow his patronising blessing on Keir Starmer at a Future of Britain conference.”\n\nThat is because if Starmer does become prime minister, he will find that many of Britain’s problems “go all the way back to the catastrophic mistakes of Tony Blair’s 10-year reign”, Parsons added.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph’s Tim Stanley, Starmer’s appearance was less about grappling with Blair’s legacy, more a clarification of Starmer’s own brand of politics.\n\n“Had Jeremy Corbyn been invited to this conference, he’d have glued his hands to the floor in protest”, Stanley said. “But that’s the point. Corbyn was a socialist; Keir is desperate to prove he’s anything but.”\n\nThere may be good reasons for Starmer to try to imitate Blair, said Robert Shrimsley in the FT Magazine, given “pretty much everyone of consequence has either copied his style or defined themselves against it. And most of those who defined themselves against him are unified by not having been prime minister.”\n\nEven after all these years, Blair “remains the reference point for how a prime minister looks”, Shrimsley said. But if Starmer does pursue a policy of emulation, he is going to face an uphill battle given he “lacks Blair’s charisma, clarity, zeal and certainty”. And even more significantly, “he fails to engender the excitement that Blair created before coming to power”, Shrimsley concluded.\n\nWhat next?\n\nStarmer’s agenda as Labour leader now “so closely resembles the policy prescriptions put forward by the Tony Blair Institute”, argued Tom McTague, political editor of UnHerd, “that there is talk throughout Westminster of a Blairite reconquista”.\n\nThe Labour leader “doesn’t have very many ideas or contacts, and Blair stands ready to oblige”, Fraser Nelson in The Telegraph agreed. Consequently, “we can expect to see a good number of these Blairite staffers and allies transferred into a Starmer government. Some have started work already”.\n\nYet the connection between the two men may only go so far, said Andrew Marr in the New Statesman. Starmer is certainly an admirer of Blair, but he is also cautious of getting too close to his predecessor.\n\nThe current Labour leader “regards Blair’s experience, not least as a Labour prime-minister-in-waiting, as immensely valuable”. However, Marr added, “there is little sense of the sorcerer and his apprentice; rather a wary mutual respect”.\n\nSome also question the extent to which Blair or his staff really wield decisive influence. “Some people understand better than others that what it means to be a Labour moderniser in 2023 isn’t quite the same as 1997,” one told The Times’s Ledwith and Maguire.\n\nIndeed, Starmer is “a different breed of Labour leader” from many we have seen in recent years, said John Crace in The Guardian. He is “a man with an eye on the Downing Street prize. A pragmatist who will do whatever it takes to win an election.”\n\nFor better or worse he is also a man who “recognises politics is a grubby game”, Crace added. One who feels implicitly that “there’s nothing to be gained by being on the right side of the argument if you’re left twiddling your thumbs on the opposition benches”.\n\nAt the end of their conversation at the Future of Britain conference, Blair turned to Starmer and said “we’ll be in good hands with you.” For Crace, with those few words, “a healing of sorts had taken place”.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Joel Mathis", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/958306/cabinet-reshuffle-how-do-tory-and-labour-frontbenches-match-up", "title": "Cabinet reshuffle: how do the Tory and Labour frontbenches match ...", "text": "Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle marks the start of a fresh round of clashes between the Labour and Conservative frontbenches.\n\nThe new prime minister has replaced a third of Liz Truss’s cabinet in “an attempt to reset the government” following her “calamitous 49-day premiership”, said The Telegraph’s political editor Ben Riley-Smith. Sunak has removed “key allies” of Truss and Boris Johnson and “rewarded some loyal supporters with top jobs”, wrote the BBC’s Paul Seddon.\n\nBut while the arrival of Britain’s first ethnic-minority prime minister has been heralded as a milestone for diversity, it “looks like Rishi has a woman problem”, an insider told The Sun. With just seven women among the 22 full-time members of the new cabinet, “it’s like Boris’s cabinet, without Boris”, the source reportedly quipped.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But new tactics may come into play as each member of the Labour team squares up against their Tory counterpart.\n\nHome office: Suella Braverman vs. Yvette Cooper\n\nBraverman arrived back in the Home Office as home secretary just days after quitting the role for breaking the ministerial code. The Telegraph’s leader column welcomed Braverman’s chance “to prove her abilities” after she was forced to resign “over a technicality”.\n\nBut Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was “livid” about her swift return, The Times reported .And charities have accused Sunak of “amping up the cruelty” in his new cabinet by bringing the right-winger back into the fold, said The Independent’s home affairs editor Lizzie Dearden.\n\nBraverman made a bid for the top job back in July, but was eliminated from the Tory leadership race in the second round after attracting only 27 backers. By contrast, her Labour counterpart has been tipped as a future leader of the opposition party.\n\nLast year Cooper “received an outpouring of support for asking a series of powerful questions” about Covid to the then home secretary, Priti Patel, said Indy100. Cooper has also laid into the decision to appoint Braverman to the role, accusing Sunak of putting “party before country”.\n\nForeign office: James Cleverly vs. David Lammy\n\nCleverly has retained his role as foreign secretary despite having regularly courted controversy over the years. In 2010, he was forced to apologise after tweeting that Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes was a “dick”. In 2019, Cleverly himself came under attack on social media for dismissing Ken Loach’s benefits film I, Daniel Blake as “a work of fiction”.\n\nIndeed, Cleverly is regularly portrayed on social media as “an unusually stupid politician”, wrote Ailbhe Rea The New Statesman.\n\nLammy has attracted his fair share of criticism too. In 2019, he was criticised for saying that comparing the Tory party’s European Research Group (ERG) to the Nazis was “not strong enough”.\n\nBut Lammy has been applauded for his performance and policies as shadow foreign secretary since taking on the role last year. Environmental campaigners welcomed his vow at the Labour conference in September to introduce a “green dimension” to foreign policy so that “never again will we be dependent on fossil fuel dictators”.\n\nTreasury: Jeremy Hunt vs. Rachel Reeves\n\nHunt, who stays on as chancellor, is “seen as a steady hand, so keeping him could be an attempt to reassure the markets”, said Sky News’s Faye Brown. Since being parachuted in by Truss earlier this month to replace Kwasi Kwarteng, Hunt has “won plenty of praise from both his own party and even grudging respect from those opposing him”, added the i news site’s Paul Waugh.\n\nYet both of Hunt’s tilts at the party leadership ended in failure. And while he was previously was Britain’s longest-serving health secretary, he was also “very possibly” the “most unpopular”, said The Times, with healthcare staff accusing him of driving medics out of the profession.\n\nAs Sunak’s new cabinet now settles in, Hunt’s opposite number “is convincing the City they can bank on her”, said The Sunday Times. Following a “whirlwind tour of breakfasts, lunches and dinners with captains of industry”, former Bank of England economist Reeves has “come to be seen as an unflashy but credible contender for No. 11”, according to the paper.\n\nHer reported success marks a major reversal in fortunes for Reeves, who finished in fourth place in the 2006 Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, as Labour’s support fell from 10,241 votes to 1,925 – the worst performance for a governing party since 1991.\n\nDepartment for Levelling Up: Michael Gove vs. Lisa Nandy\n\nSecretary of State for Levelling Up Gove has become the Tories’ “undisputed comeback king” after being “recalled to the cabinet following his latest spell in the wilderness”, said The Telegraph’s associate editor Gordon Rayner.\n\n“It’s stating the obvious but the reason he keeps being brought back into the fold is because he gets stuff done,” an unnamed ally told the paper, “and there are precious few ministers who you can say that about.”\n\nBut Nandy is also a “formidable performer”, said Politico’s Eleni Courea.\n\nThe Labour shadow minister is “neither from the ‘Corbynista’ nor the more right-wing ‘Blairite’ side of the party”, the Financial Times said. The Guardian agreed that the “refreshingly untribal” Nandy has the “pragmatism and ability to bridge divides”.\n\nDeputy PM: Dominic Raab vs. Angela Rayner\n\nReappointed deputy PM after just a few months on the sidelines, Raab has received mixed reviews for his performances in the chamber. In April 2020, he took over prime ministerial responsibilities while then Tory leader Johnson was hospitalised with Covid.\n\nPolitico’s Annabelle Dickson reported that according to “half a dozen current and former colleagues” of ex-lawyer Raab, he was “a forensic stand-in for the prime minister, albeit one who sometimes lacks charm”.\n\nRaab has also served as foreign secretary but was demoted to justice secretary last September, following criticism of his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nRayner has trodden a sometimes rocky political road too. Long-running tensions between Rayner and Starmer came to a head when he sacked her as party chair and national campaign coordinator following Labour’s poor local election results in 2021. Months later, she was criticised for describing Tories as “homophobic, racist, misogynistic … scum” at the Labour conference.\n\nYet Rayner has also been praised for her plain-speaking style and has performed well against Raab in the Commons. “Rayner skewers Raab at PMQs,” Isabel Hardman reported in The Spectator following a clash in July.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Anahi Valenzuela", "Joel Mathis", "Justin Klawans", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week", "text": "1.

His personal life was in disarray after an affair with his secretary.\n\nBut the 49-year-old soon turned up alive and well, having travelled “to Australia under an assumed name”, said the BBC. After being questioned by Australian police as to whether he was the recently disappeared Lord Lucan, it was soon found he must be the “other missing Englishman”.\n\nStonehouse confessed and was brought back to the UK to be tried, and eventually found guilty of “various counts of theft, fraud and deception”, said the i news site. He remained the MP for Walsall North until his imprisonment in August 1976 (having been sentenced to seven years, of which he served three). The subsequent by-election was won by the Conservatives, “putting further pressure” on the “struggling” incumbent Labour government.\n\nJeremy Thorpe\n\nThe Liberal party leader Jeremy Thorpe ended his parliamentary career in an “extraordinary tale of sex, power and corruption”, said The Guardian. In 1979 he was put on trial accused of arranging for a hitman to kill his former lover Norman Scott on Exmoor in 1975.\n\nThe “hapless hitman”, Andrew Newton, managed only to shoot Scott’s dog, a Great Dane called Rinka, “instead of his human target”, said The Spectator.\n\nWhen Newton was jailed for two years for the dog’s killing in 1976, the scandal was enough for Thorpe to lose the confidence of his party, and he was forced to resign in May of that year. Though he was acquitted at his own trial three years later, the “lurid speculation” about the facts of the case “dogged” the rest of his life.\n\nHe made “several attempts” to enter the House of Lords, said The Spectator, but “never managed to return to public life”.\n\nLord Lambton\n\nLord Antony Lambton was the son of the Earl of Durham, who “gave up his title” to pursue a political career and led a “decidedly colourful private life”, said the Evening Standard.\n\nA “self-confessed drug user” and “prodigiously unfaithful to his wife”, Lambton was “finally exposed” in May 1973 while serving in the Conservative government as under-secretary of state for defence. Lambton was photographed in bed with two prostitutes, smoking cannabis, by one of the prostitutes’ husbands, Colin Levy – who had used hidden cameras and a microphone to capture the Berwick-upon-Tweed MP.\n\nAfter the scandal broke, Lambton was “forced to resign and later fled to Italy”, said the Daily Mail. He lived in a mansion in Tuscany until his death in 2006.\n\nEdwina Currie\n\n(Image credit: Peter Jordan/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough she remained an MP until 1997, even Edwina Currie recognises that eggs “destroyed” her political career in 1988. She wrote in The Telegraph that she had “no regrets” about the controversy, but her warning on television that most “egg production in this country, sadly, is now infected with salmonella” resulted in her exit from Margaret Thatcher’s government.\n\nEgg sales “plummeted by 50%” and almost “four million healthy hens were culled”, said The Telegraph. Currie, who earnt the nickname “Eggwina”, was denounced as a “scaremonger”, and pressure from Tory MPs in rural farming constituencies eventually meant she was forced to quit as under-secretary of state for health.\n\nThough she was “later vindicated by a Whitehall report” about the levels of salmonella, the controversy had consigned her to the back benches.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959217/unlikely-political-friendships-through-the-years", "title": "Unlikely political friendships through the years | The Week", "text": "A former Conservative minister threw her support behind Labour leader Keir Starmer this week after quitting her own party and branding it ridden with “ideology and self-obsession”.\n\nClaire Perry O’Neill, who was a Tory MP from 2010 to 2019 and served as a member of Theresa May’s cabinet as well as briefly under Boris Johnson, said in an article for The Times that she had quit the Conservative Party earlier this month, before lavishing praise on the Labour leader.\n\nIn an article on the growth of renewable energy, she said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his chancellor Jeremy Hunt are “too beholden to a party dominated now by ideology and self-obsession to deliver the big changes we need in a fact-based, competent way”.

Labour List reported that a catalyst behind the switch had been Wakeford’s friendship with Labour MP Barry Gardiner, following their work together in support of Gardiner’s anti “fire and rehire” bill.\n\nFriendships across the political divide are “always surprising to outside observers” within the walls of Westminster but “they are so common that they are rarely commented upon”, wrote former Labour MP Tom Harris in The Telegraph. Nevertheless, such friendships are frequently a “love that dare not speak its name” in the public eye, he said.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the more surprising political friendships within Westminster and across the world.\n\nAlastair Campbell and Charles Kennedy\n\nFormer New Labour spin doctor and journalist Alastair Campell wrote movingly about his close friendship with the late Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy in an article for the i news site in 2021.\n\nBecoming close during the New Labour years – despite significant disagreement on the Iraq War – Campbell wrote that he was “taken aback by just how deeply grief-stricken” he was when the Lib Dem politician died in 2015. He paid tribute to a friendship that “taught me it is possible to be on different sides in politics, but the same side when it comes to basic humanity”.\n\nIan Paisley and Martin McGuinness\n\nSinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness and the DUP’s Ian Paisley formed an unlikely political friendship after the two parties came to a power-sharing agreement in 2007 (Image credit: Paul Faith/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nLong-standing and often bitter political rivals in Northern Irish politics, Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness and the DUP’s Ian Paisley formed an unlikely political friendship after the two parties came to a power-sharing agreement in 2007.\n\nAfter Paisley and McGuinness became First Minister and Deputy First Minister, the pair would frequently travel together, albeit discreetly, sharing the same aircraft but disembarking separately to avoid being seen together. Their close bond quickly became evident, however, earning them the nickname “The Chuckle Brothers”.\n\n“Our relationship confounded many. Of course, our political differences continued; his allegiance was to Britain and mine to Ireland. But we were able to work effectively together in the interests of all our people,” said McGuinness after Paisley’s death, according to the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nMargaret Thatcher and Augusto Pinochet\n\nThe friendship between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was “widely criticised” at the time, said MSN.com. The unlikely alliance began in 1982 when Chile assisted Britain in regaining the Falkland Islands, which had been invaded by Argentina.\n\nThatcher, who never forgot the debt of gratitude, later, spoke out against the “callous and unjust” decision to place her “true friend” under house arrest in England for human rights violations in 1998.\n\nJoe Biden and John McCain\n\n(Image credit: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)\n\nThe late Republican senator John McCain shared a close friendship with President Joe Biden while they served together in the US Senate. Their close friendship over party lines was evident at McCain’s funeral where Biden paid a loving tribute to the late politician, stating: “I’m a Democrat. And I loved John McCain.”\n\nTheir friendship “seems to have affected policymaking” too, said CNN. Biden and McCain were seen to be in an “emotional discussion” before McCain cast a critical vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2017, one of three Republicans to do so.\n\nBill Clinton and George Bush Snr\n\n“If anyone had a right to despise Bill Clinton,” it was “the man he kicked out of the White House”, wrote Jacob Hess for Deseret News.\n\nInstead, the two formed an unlikely friendship sparked by a generous note left by George Bush Snr to his successor on entering the White House. It read: “You will be our president when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good luck, George.”\n\nClinton would later call their friendship “one of the great joys of my life” and upon the death of the former Republican president said: “I just loved him.”\n\nBill Clinton and George Bush Snr\n\n(Image credit: Bettmann/Getty Images)\n\nThe friendship between Canada’s former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro was one that was “marred” by the Western world’s isolationist policies towards communist Cuba, said MSN.com.\n\nIn 1976, Trudeau visited Havana with the aim of normalising relations with the island nation, despite the meeting drawing criticism from members of the Canadian public. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were never severed, with Castro attending Trudeau’s funeral in 2000.\n\nUpon Castro’s death in 2016, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau warmly recalled his late father’s friendship with the Cuban leader and paid tribute to a “remarkable leader” in words that Reuters called “markedly more positive” than those of most Western leaders who “either condemned the revolutionary leader’s human rights record or tiptoed around the subject”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans"], "publish_date": "2023/01/12"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/953007/keir-starmer-five-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-labour-leader", "title": "Keir Starmer: five things you didn't know about the Labour leader ...", "text": "Keir Starmer may have been branded boring by his critics, but an interview with Piers Morgan promises to show a new side to the former chief prosecutor turned Labour leader.\n\nThe 58-year-old MP for Holborn and St Pancras will be hoping to boost his appeal to voters after disappointing results in May’s local election began grumblings in the parliamentary party – and sparked rumours of a possible leadership contest should Labour lose another seat in the upcoming Batley and Spen by-election.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the show’s broadcast at 9.30pm on ITV tonight, Morgan has claimed: “This is the interview that shows the real him and it is one of the most searingly honest and intensely emotional interviews I've ever done.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The 1980s shots are “a world away from the slick suits and immaculately groomed hair most would associate him with today”, writes the Daily Mail.\n\nHis unusual name causes him trouble\n\nDuring an appearance on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs last year, Starmer described his parents as “Labour through and through”, although not the type to hold political discussions around the dinner table.\n\nBut the pair’s knowledge of Labour history seems to have been sharp, with Starmer, the party’s 19th parliamentary leader, named after its first: Keir Hardie, a man who rose from humble beginnings to lead the party from 1906 to 1908.\n\nBut he wasn’t always so fond of the name, telling The Guardian in a 2009 profile that it sometimes led to playground teasing: “When I was at school, at about 13, I thought, why couldn't they have called me Dave or Pete?”, he said.\n\nAnd his critics seem unafraid to subject his name to further mockery, with many Starmer sceptics taking to calling the Labour leader “Keith” on social media platforms.\n\nKerry-Anne Mendoza, editor of the far-left blog The Canary, wrote that “the Left rebranded Keir as ‘Keith’ to dissociate him from the Labour legend he’s named after”, although others believe the origin of the name has a far simpler explanation: it’s a common autocorrect suggestion, sometimes left for comic effect.\n\nHe’s lost both his parents\n\nSome of the most emotional parts of tonight’s interview come as Starmer discusses his relationship with his parents, frequently complicated by his mother’s lifelong illness.\n\nHolding back tears at several points during the interview, Starmer tells Morgan that while he was “extraordinarily close” to his mother, who suffered from Still’s disease for 50 years, he had a more difficult relationship with his father, whose tireless devotion to his ill wife was often at the expense of his relationship to his children.\n\n“His whole life was devoted to her and her health and what she needed and what she wanted. She was his whole life. That devotion, that sense of duty, is very, very powerful. It was a lifelong duty and when she died it broke him,” he tells Morgan.\n\nStarmer’s mother never saw her son elected, dying just weeks before he became MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. His father became a recluse after his mother’s death and died in 2018.\n\nHe’s a keen footballer\n\nStarmer is a keen footballer and is still frequently pictured playing amateur five- and seven-a-side matches close to his home in north London, often sporting a Donegal Gaelic football shirt – although, locally, he supports Arsenal.\n\n“Unless I'm irreparably injured, I intend to do it for as long as I possibly can,” he told The Guardian in a 2009 profile, while still in his role as director of public prosecutions.\n\n“I used to be FA-registered, it was competitive stuff, but these are friendlies, eight-a-side and five-a-side,” he said.\n\nHe’s a committed vegetarian… or is he?\n\nStarmer had professed to be a vegetarian for several years, last year telling Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he gave up meat as “a matter of principle years ago on the basis that eating meat wasn't the right thing for the body and the planet”.\n\nIn the same interview, however, he admitted to missing “almost everything” – particularly bacon sandwiches and chicken curry – which may go some way to explain why he was pictured tucking into fish and chips while out on the campaign trail in Hartlepool earlier this year.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2021/06/01"}]}

Questions at the media briefing were not allowed.\n\nWang said some had questioned China’s motives in being so active in the Pacific islands, and his response was China supported developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean also.\n\n“Don’t be too anxious and don’t be too nervous, because the common development and prosperity of China and all the other developing countries would only mean great harmony, greater justice and greater progress of the whole world,” he said.\n\nTaking questions after Wang’s briefing, China’s Ambassador to Fiji, Qian Bo, said participants had agreed to discuss the draft communique and the five-year plan “until we have reached an agreement.”\n\n“There has been general support from the 10 countries with which we have diplomatic relations, but of course there are some concerns on some specific issues.”\n\nFiji’s Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama told reporters the Pacific nations were prioritizing consensus.\n\n“Geopolitical point-scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas, whose job is being lost to the pandemic, or whose family is impacted by the rapid rise in the price of commodities,” Bainimarama said.\n\nIn a written address to the meeting, China’s leader Xi Jinping said China will always be a good friend of Pacific Island countries no matter how the international situation changes, China’s state-owned CCTV reported.\n\nPacific tour\n\nSeveral invited nations want to defer action on the draft communique or have it amended, an official from one Pacific country said earlier.\n\nThe United States, Australia, Japan and New Zealand have expressed concern about a security pact signed by the Solomon Islands with China last month, saying it had regional consequences and could lead to a Chinese military presence close to Australia.\n\nThe new Australian government has made the Pacific islands an early foreign policy priority to counter Beijing’s push, sending the foreign minister to Fiji with the message Australia would put new priority on the region’s biggest security challenge of climate change and announcing a new visa program to allow Pacific island citizens to migrate.\n\nIn Honiara last week, Wang condemned interference in the deal and said the Solomon Islands’ relationship with China was a model for other Pacific island nations.\n\nWith borders closed across the region because of the Covid pandemic, most foreign ministers are attending the Fiji meeting by video link.

It has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China’s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, North Korea’s weapons program, Taiwan, and a controversial new security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Quad.\n\nHow did it form?\n\nThe partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the four countries set up a “regional core group” to help relief efforts. But the Quad in its current form was created in 2007 and held its first meeting in May that year.\n\nIn a speech several months after that first meeting, Japan’s then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described his vision of a “broader Asia … an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, incorporating the United States of America and Australia.”\n\nThe countries shared “fundamental values” such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests, he said.\n\nThe initiative fell apart in 2008 under intense pressure from China and the threat of economic retaliation, said Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBut it was revived in 2017 amid renewed concerns about China’s rapid rise as a global superpower and Beijing’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy.\n\nSince then, the group has grown more active, with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in March 2021, before then meeting in person for the first time in September that year.\n\nAt the time, a senior US official emphasized the Quad was “an unofficial gathering,” but called it “a key and critical format,” adding “we are deepening coordination on a daily basis.”\n\nA meeting of the Quad leaders at a summit at the White House on September 24, 2021. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nWhat does the Quad do?\n\nThough sometimes dubbed by critics as an “Asian NATO,” the Quad is not a formal military alliance – rather, it’s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.\n\nIt does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.\n\n“It’s deliberately more amorphous than that, so that it can withstand changes in political decision-making in each of the democracies, and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics,” Paskal said.\n\nQuad members cooperate across fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.\n\nBut security and the goal of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” are key focuses, with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism, disinformation and territorial disputes.\n\nAircraft carriers and warships participate in the Malabar naval exercises, attended by the US, Australia, India and Japan, in the Northern Arabian Sea on November 17, 2020. Indian Navy/AP\n\nMilitary cooperation has increased in recent years, with Australia joining the other three in the 2020 Malabar naval exercises – the first time all four members had participated in the drills since 2007.\n\nLast September, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia signed a security deal known as AUKUS that will eventually bring nuclear-powered submarines to the region – a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with France and angered China.\n\nAnd this January, Japan and Australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation, with Australia saying the agreement included “an expanding agenda for the Quad.”\n\nHow does China play into this?\n\nThe Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China’s growing reach in the region, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing over the past few years.\n\nThe India-China relationship has come under growing strain since May 2020 when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nAustralia and China have been involved in a series of trade spats since Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while Japan and China remain at odds over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nThe US-China relationship has also steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by a trade war, pandemic finger-pointing and military saber-rattling.\n\nThe strategic location of each of the Quad nations – at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them – has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China “clique” that is emblematic of a “poisonous” Cold War mentality.\n\nA Chinese airstrip on a man-made island in the South China Sea, seen on March 20. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nExacerbating these tensions, China has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges. In recent years, China has built up its military positions in the South China Sea, despite a UN tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there. It has also ramped up threats against Taiwan – a self-governing island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it – and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone.\n\n“China’s rise is now the global phenomenon that not (only) involves the neighboring nations, but also the safety of maritime security in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, all the way to the Indian Ocean,” said Ken Jimbo, a professor in the faculty of policy management at Japan’s Keio University.\n\nIn April, China announced a security pact with the Solomon Islands, sparking protests from Australia, New Zealand and the US. Many were concerned it would allow China to build a military base in the tiny Pacific nation, though the islands’ leader has said he has no intention of this happening.\n\nStill, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where the government’s close relationship with Beijing has already sparked protests.\n\n“What countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from China is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries … which brings it more strongly into the Chinese orbit,” said Paskal, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nWhat are the other major issues?\n\nOther issues that may come up at the summit include the security of Taiwan.\n\nA recent surge of Chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island. Top US intelligence officials told Congress this monththat China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an “acute” threat between now and 2030.\n\nQuad members have voiced support for Taiwan, which the US supplies with arms for self defense. On Monday, during a press conference in Japan, US President Joe Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don’t reflect a change in US policy.\n\nBut many analysts have drawn parallels between Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan’s situation – concerns echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, when he said peace in the Taiwan Strait was “critical” and countries must “never tolerate” forceful attempts to change the status quo in East Asia.\n\n“If Taiwan falls to China, that breaks the first island chain and compromises Japanese security,” Paskal said. “The fall of Taiwan is a deep security threat to all four Quad partners.”\n\nNorth Korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table, said Jimbo, the Keio University professor. The country has recently stepped up its missile testing, in defiance of international law and to the alarm of Japan and the US. It has launched 15 missile tests this year so far, compared to four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nThe war in Ukraine will be another focus, with the summit taking place exactly three months after Russia launched its invasion. Australia, Japan and the US have all taken hard stances in condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions on Moscow – leaving India the odd one out.\n\nIndia has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with Moscow; most estimates suggest more than 50% of India’s military equipment comes from Russia. These supplies are vital, given India’s border tensions with both China and Pakistan.\n\nThough India’s position has caused “a significant amount of frustration” among the other three bloc members, Jimbo said “it also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose India from the Quad – so obviously, we are going to pursue what we can agree (on) at this point together with India.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/asia-pacific/956856/the-quad-the-origins-of-the-quadrilateral-security-dialogue", "title": "The Quad: the origins of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue | The ...", "text": "The leaders of the US, Japan, Australia and India yesterday pledged to be “a force for good” in a “free and open Indo-Pacific” following a meeting in Tokyo of the so-called Quad.\n\nIn a joint statement, US President Joe Biden and prime ministers Fumio Kishida, Narendra Modi and Australia’s newly elected leader Anthony Albanese said the Quad was “committed to bringing tangible benefits to the region” at a time of profound global challenges.\n\nBut according to Reuters, the Ukraine invasion is “an issue that has risked division among the group”, as India, which has close ties with the Kremlin, resists calls to condemn Moscow’s war.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

According to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the meeting “was characterised as an ‘informal grouping’ that touched on areas of common interest”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe political union triggered alarm in China. The BBC reported that “a deeply concerned Beijing” had “sent formal protests to the four governments”.\n\nAmid “unclear objectives and mounting Chinese pressure”, said USA Today, “Australia, India and the United States hesitated to formalise the dialogue”.\n\nThe sudden resignation of Abe in September 2007 then eliminated what the CSIS described as the Quad’s “main cheerleader and architect”.\n\n… and then revived once more?\n\nThe Quad was formally resurrected in 2017, amid alarm over China’s growing regional influence.\n\n“Both the Trump and Biden administrations saw the Quad as key to a pivot towards placing more focus on the Indo-Pacific region, particularly as a counterweight to China’s assertive actions,” according to the Associated Press. The first formal Quad summit was held in 2021 and the member nations’ leaders met again virtually in March this year.\n\nThe Quad’s goal “is to keep military and political influence out of the critical water routes in the Indo-Pacific”, said India-based site News9Live, and to “maintain a worldwide order based on norms, as well as freedom of navigation and a free trading system”.\n\nThe alliance also aims to provide alternative debt financing to countries in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n“Over the years, the Quad’s diplomacy has waxed and waned,” said the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFollowing this week’s meeting, the four nations unveiled a maritime initiative to combat illegal fishing, and pledged to invest more than $50bn in developing infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific as part of their push to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nChina has shot back by describing the group as an “Asian Nato”. Although the four nations have not made a mutual-defence pact, the grouping is intended to deepen military, economic and diplomatic ties.\n\n“And while they don’t often explicitly say it, those partnerships are meant to be a bulwark against Chinese aggression,” said Delhi-based news site livemint.com.\n\nBeijing and some Indian nationalists and leftists argue that Asian security should be moulded by Asian powers alone.\n\nAs global tensions grow, South Korea has expressed interest in joining the Quad, “though US officials have said they are not contemplating adjusting the group’s membership”, the site added.\n\nBut South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam have been included in “Quad-plus” meetings “which could form the basis for future expansion or partnership in the region”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/politics/harris-asia-trip/index.html", "title": "Kamala Harris dives into Asian diplomacy amid questions back ...", "text": "Palawan, Philippines CNN —\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is sticking close to her script when responding to what Democrats hope will once again be their greatest electoral mobilizer: Donald Trump and his third White House bid.\n\n“The president said he intends to run and if he does, I will be running with him,” she told CNN on Tuesday – the first time she’d been asked about Trump’s 2024 candidacy, which he announced last week. She was addressing a gaggle of reporters aboard the Teresa Magbanua, a Philippine Coast Guard vessel stationed at the edge of the South China Sea.\n\nHer cautious response at the end of a weeklong gaffe-free trip to Thailand and the Philippines could serve as a reflection of Harris’ vice presidency in its second year: toe the line but don’t make waves.\n\nAs she returns from Asia, she’s stuck in a swirl of uncertainty about her place in the party if the now 80-year-old President Joe Biden does not seek a second term. The President is expected to consider the decision over Thanksgiving and upcoming holidays with family, whose advice he’ll seek about running for reelection.\n\nHarris’ trip to Asia – her third to the region since taking office – was another chance for America’s first South Asian vice president to showcase her ability to lead in the traditional ways of the vice presidency without overstepping her role as No. 2.\n\nShe attended a series of bilateral meetings and greetings with Asian prime ministers and presidents alike, including China’s President Xi Jinping, called a last-minute high-profile meeting with Indo-Pacific countries after North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile hours before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ summit began and went on a symbolic visit to the Philippines’ archipelago island of Palawan, which could potentially heighten tensions with China.\n\nWith Biden in Washington, DC, for his granddaughter’s wedding, Harris continued her role as his top-ranking envoy in a trip meant to deepen ties to mostly friendly Asian nations and cast the US as the region’s best option for economic stability –part of an ongoing effort to counter China’s growing influence.\n\nThe vice president called the trip a success, as she brandished her policy chops in the region, attempting to fashion herself as a deft leader who speaks for Biden in his absence.\n\n“It is very important that we were here today to restate the United States commitment to international rules and norms. This trip and this visit in particular has also been about demonstrating the strength and importance of our relationship with the Philippines both as it relates to economic issues and also security issues,” Harris said in Palawan, in a speech where she rejected China’s aggression in the South China Sea and announced funding initiatives ameant to beef up the country’s systems and deepen security ties.\n\nStill, Harris’ events were tightly scripted and the trip itself, highly choreographed.\n\nHarris’ “brief greeting” with Xi, as her office described it, was her first face-to-face meeting with the world leader, happening on the margins of APEC. It was likely Harris’ most high-profile moment of the trip, despite the lack of US press in the room to witness it. The vice president met with him just a week after Biden’s first in-person bilateral with Xi, which lasted three hours.\n\nBut unlike the president, who can share as much of a conversation as he pleases, there was an obvious limit to how much Harris felt comfortable sharing. She repeatedly declined to go far beyond what was written in a carefully calculated statement on her meeting with Xi.\n\n“We discussed that we are keeping open lines of communication, that we do not seek conflict or confrontation, but we welcome competition,” Harris told reporters in a press conference wrapping up her trip to Thailand, dodging twice whether that conversation touched on North Korea or Taiwan.\n\nIf the goal was to remain gaffe free, the planning seems to have paid off. The Republican National Committee only clipped on Twitter moments thatmay have been awkward but didn’t lend themselves to real criticism –unusual treatment for one of their most attacked Democrats.\n\nHarris’ diplomatic efforts\n\nOn the first day of APEC, a “deeply concerned” Harris rushed aides to convene a last-minute unannounced multi-lateral emergency meeting with Indo-Pacific region allies, according to a senior administration official, after North Korea launched a long-range ballistic missile Friday morning– her second most high-profile moment of the trip.\n\nHarris directed her team once she was briefed on the latest launch, a White House official said utilizing the Indo-Pacific nation’s presence at the APEC Leaders Summit to do so. At the head of a u-shaped table inside a small room in the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center, the vice president accused North Korea of “brazen violation of multiple UN security resolutions.”\n\n“This conduct by North Korea most recently is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security resolutions. It destabilizes security in the region, and unnecessarily raises tensions. We strongly condemn these actions, and we again call North Korea to stop further unlawful destabilizing,” Harris said. “On behalf of the United States, I reaffirmed our ironclad commitment to our Indo Pacific Alliance.”\n\nHer statement closely tracked one the National Security Council issued hours earlier on Biden’s behalf, almost to a tee.\n\nThe last-minute nature of the meeting caused aides to move quickly to corral the US press, but without time to pre-set cameras, press from the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Korea were fighting for an angle – causing the photo-op visuals to be at times shaky and askew.\n\nStill, it was a moment that looked almost presidential for Harris as it was reminiscent of the emergency in-person meeting Biden convened with top allies during his final day at the G20 in Indonesia, when a Russian-made missile fell inside the borders of a NATO ally.\n\nBut the presidential posturing had limits. During the weeklong trip, the vice president only answered political and policy questions on two separate occasions from the group of all women reporters traveling with her from Washington – taking two or three questions each time.\n\nHarris didn’t stray from talking points in her answers, careful not to move beyond Biden’s position on a multitude of issues.\n\nHarris focuses on women\n\nHarris has long sought opportunities to showcase her own interests and craft her own lane as a younger vice president with potential presidential ambitions.\n\nDomestically, she has taken the lead for the administration on abortion rights. And on foreign trips, Harris has told aides she wants to go outside of the box when it comes to the schedule. A major part of that has been to meet with women and families in different countries.\n\nThat directive was evident in Manila, when she participated in a moderated conversation about women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship inside a ballroom in the Sofitel.\n\n“On the issue of the economic wellbeing of women, I think we all know, and I feel very strongly, you lift up the economic status of a woman, her family will be lifted. Her community will be lifted,” Harris said as the Filipino women nodded in agreement. “All of society will benefit. Lift up the economic status of women, and all of society benefits.”\n\nIn the Palawan fishing village of Tagburos, Harris watched women clean fish in front of a picturesque backdrop to talk about the devastation climate change and illegal fishing has had on the village.\n\n“Hi ma’am,” they yelled as she approached. Harris’ translator introduced the women as her best friends.\n\n“Best friends,” Harris said, with a laugh and a wave.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/12/asean-obama-summit-sunnylands/78743288/", "title": "Obama and Southeast Asian leaders to talk trade, security", "text": "Rosalie Murphy\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nLeaders from 10 Southeast Asian countries will arrive at Sunnylands on Monday for two days of meetings with President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials, advancing a relationship that experts say could be key to Obama's foreign policy legacy.\n\nThis meeting marks Obama's fourth summit with these nations, who comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the first on U.S. soil. Topping the agenda, experts believe, are security concerns in the South China Sea and the recently signed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal.\n\n“I think the U.S. is trying to get very close to ASEAN,” said Amitav Acharya, director of the ASEAN Studies Initiative at American University and a leading scholar studying the region. “Especially under Obama, the U.S. has moved closer to ASEAN in a political and strategic relationship.”\n\nASEAN includes the countries of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nAbout 600 million people, nearly 10 percent of the world’s population, live in these countries. Together, they produce a gross domestic product of $2.5 trillion, larger than that of 1.2-billion-person India, Acharya said. And the region’s location — between China, India and Australia, bordering two oceans and some of the world's busiest shipping lanes — makes it a critical partner for U.S. trade and security alike.\n\nSunnylands, of course, is the same place where Obama met Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013. Acharya explained that choosing Sunnylands as a forum sends a powerful signal.\n\n“In inviting the ASEAN countries to the same venue where Obama met the leader of China — that sends a message that the U.S. considers ASEAN as an equal partner compared to China,” Acharya said. “That will be the significance.”\n\nASEAN: Facilitating dialogue among diverse nations\n\nASEAN formed as a five-country alliance in 1967. At that time, the nations of Southeast Asia as we know them were still emerging from colonial rule. Also, the Cold War was at its height, and Communist insurgencies were fighting for power in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\nSo Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines aligned with one another, in hopes of protecting themselves from foreign intervention.\n\n“These are countries that have been colonized. They were colonized by the Brits; by the French; by the Americans, in the Philippines; they were kind of a pawn of the Cold War,” said Richard Stubbs, a professor of political science at McMaster University who has studied ASEAN since the 1970s. “The idea of ASEAN is to keep ASEAN as an area which is free of great (foreign) power.”\n\nBrunei joined the alliance in the 1980s, followed by Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam in the 1990s. And Stubbs said ASEAN’s primary mission remains the same.\n\n“They want to retain their autonomy, their ability to act in their own best interest, without being told what to do by America or by China or by Japan or Russia or the European Union, whoever it is,” Stubbs said.\n\nASEAN’s 10 countries are strikingly different, Stubbs and others emphasized. For example, systems of government range widely. People in Indonesia and the Philippines live in fairly well-developed democracies, according to Human Rights Watch. On the other hand, Brunei is one of the last countries in the world governed by an absolute monarch.\n\nReligiously, Southeast Asia includes the Roman Catholic Philippines; Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation; and Myanmar, which has a long history of Buddhist-Muslim conflict.\n\nAnd economically, Singapore is a global financial center. Investment from Japan and the U.S. has spurred the growth of middle-classes with money to spend in some nations — Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have become centers of manufacturing, for example — while in Cambodia, half of the workforce is still on farms. Income per capita ranges from $83,000 in Singapore to just $3,000 in Cambodia, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nAn organization like ASEAN keeps these diverse countries talking, both to each other and to powers like the U.S., China and Japan, explained Alice Ba, a professor of political science at the University of Delaware.\n\n“ASEAN has played a facilitating role in bringing diverse actors together in the region. It’s also played a stabilizing role in Southeast Asia,” Ba said. “Most of these states have fairly broad security concerns and development concerns, so it’s facilitating cooperation, a greater harmonization of interests.”\n\nCountering China\n\nExperts explained that the U.S.’s increased focus on its relationship with ASEAN is part of a broad foreign policy effort by the Obama administration, which has sought to shift focus and resources toward Asia. The U.S. appointed an ambassador to ASEAN, Nina Hachigian, in 2011 and has been meeting annually with the organization since 2013.\n\nJosh Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, explained that regular meetings with ASEAN show that the U.S. takes the region seriously. It’s also a way to meet one-on-one with countries the president wouldn’t invite to Washington or visit individually — he pointed to Cambodia and Thailand, whose leaders have particularly poor human rights records.\n\n“It’s a way to demonstrate the U.S.’s commitment to remaining an important player, if not the most important player, in Asia in general,” Kurlantzick said.\n\nAmerican University's Acharya added that, “There is some feeling in the region that the U.S. cannot be trusted to stay around in the region.” Past American leaders have connected with Southeast Asia primarily as a means to oppose China or, formerly, the Soviet Union, rather than really investing there, he explained. He believes Obama will try to institutionalize this annual meeting, so the relationship will continue under the next president.\n\n“The U.S.-ASEAN summit is another way of reassuring these countries that the U.S. is committed to the region, it’s not going to withdraw, it is a reliable and credible partner,” he added.\n\nThe competitor for the position of “most important player” in the region is, of course, China. That country remains the largest trading partner for many Southeast Asian countries, and ASEAN has a free trade agreement with China. But China has also fought with ASEAN countries over who controls islands in South China Sea.\n\nBa explained that ASEAN tries to remain neutral in the U.S.-China relationship, acting as a facilitator in the region.\n\n“The U.S. has long had very extensive relations in the region, and as China advances, it can be difficult not to see them in a competitive light,” Ba said.\n\nHowever, Acharya and Ba stressed, China isn’t the only reason the U.S. is interested in Southeast Asia.\n\n“The U.S. has to be careful, and Obama has to be very careful in saying that it’s not using ASEAN to contain China,” Acharya said. “Because if it does give that impression, that will really undermine ASEAN’s unity and purpose.”\n\nMcMaster University's Stubbs added, “ASEAN benefits, I think, from having the U.S. in its corner when it’s trying to deal with China. It’s good to have the U.S. kind of looking over your shoulder when you’re talking to China... What they don’t want is America to come in and tell it what to do on a whole bunch of things, including human rights and democratization.”\n\nLikely topics for discussion\n\nNational security officials said in a Tuesday news conference that the summit will begin Monday with the arrival of ASEAN leaders. That afternoon, they'll discuss economic policy. Tuesday will focus on security concerns, including maritime security in the South China Sea and recent attacks in Jakarta.\n\nExperts agreed that likely topics for discussion include the South China Sea, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, climate change and terrorist threats.\n\nFirst, the South China Sea is a gulf of the Pacific Ocean bordered by China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. It’s an important shipping lane believed to have huge oil deposits lying beneath it. But Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations said that, in recent years, all these countries have claimed islands and reefs, in order to claim more of the surrounding waters — some of them laying claim to the same pieces of land. China has actually created artificial islands in order to claim them, expanding the waters they control, Kurlantzick said.\n\nAccording to a 2015 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, \"Whether they have seized territory or negotiated a resource-sharing scheme with some or all of the other claimants, the South China Sea will be virtually a Chinese lake\" by 2030.\n\nDiscussion of long-term military plans in the South China Sea is likely at this summit, experts who spoke to The Desert Sun agreed.\n\nNext on the probable agenda is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obama administration’s signature trade deal, which includes the U.S., Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam and seven other countries. Leaders from those nations signed the deal on Feb. 3; now, each country has to ratify it. Proponents of the agreement in the U.S. say it will lower prices for American buyers and diversify the U.S.'s trade options. But the document has drawn a variety of criticisms in the U.S. — to name a few, labor groups say it would make it easier for companies to move jobs out of the U.S., environmentalists say its pollution and conservation rules are unlikely to be enforced abroad, and Internet freedom activists say it would impose unnecessary copyright protections.\n\nStill, Acharya thinks Obama will try to recruit more countries to the deal and push the signatories to ratify it.\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership: A guide to the deal\n\nClimate problems like deforestation, the burning of fossil fuels, and particle pollution, which cause haze and smog in many Asian cities, are likely to come up, Acharya said. In light of a January shooting in Jakarta, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility, Stubbs believe they’ll discuss what local officials can do to combat radicalization and terrorist attacks. Approaches to North Korea and Syria might come up as well, Kurlantzick said.\n\nNotably absent from the agenda, experts predicted: Human rights.\n\nHuman rights concerns\n\nHuman rights concerns abound in Southeast Asia, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. His leading concerns include political repression, corruption, the restriction of free speech and freedom of religion, and the limitation of rights for women and LGBT people.\n\nSifton believes only two of ASEAN’s 10 nations, Indonesia and the Philippines, are “close to being real democracies.” Myanmar, formerly Burma, also held free elections in November after five decades of military rule.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are Cambodia, whose 30-year prime minister was a general in the Khmer Rouge, which carried out a genocide in the 1970s; and Brunei, one of the last countries in the world where a monarch controls the government. A military junta seized control of Thailand's government in 2014.\n\nSifton acknowledged that, of course, the U.S. often has to talk to nations with human rights concerns. “Our complaint is that, if you are going to invite people like this to the U.S., you need to use the invite as leverage to get something from these governments,” he said. “They could have said, ‘we want to have a summit, but let’s be frank… you need to show us some deliverables or else you’re not going to be able to come. So release some prisoners.”\n\nSifton compared the ASEAN meeting at Sunnylands to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. in 2014, which leaders from 50 countries attended. That agenda included meetings about \"democratic institutions, good governance and human rights,\" and a statement released afterward by the White House highlighted the U.S.'s monetary support for voter education and government accountability programs. Additionally, Sifton said groups like Human Rights Watch were able to meet with leaders in sessions \"around the summit.\"\n\nSunnylands is much more private than Washington. Still, organizers are planning to bring at least a thousand people to Rancho Mirage to protest during the summit — many of them immigrants or descendants of immigrants from these nations.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: More than 1,000 protesters preparing for U.S.-ASEAN summit\n\nExperts said the Obama administration has pushed human rights unevenly in Southeast Asia. Richard Stubbs of McMaster University mentioned Indonesia, which saw one democratically elected leader transfer power to another for the first time in 2014, a \"success story.\" But he also pointed out that the U.S. maintains close relations with Thailand despite a military coup in 2014. \"There doesn't seem to have been the push that some people have expected from Washington, from the Obama administration, to push for new elections,\" he said.\n\nStubbs added that Obama has tried to push ASEAN countries on these issues before, “but it’s not clear how forceful he’s been, because I think he wants ASEAN on his side.”\n\nBuilding a deeper partnership?\n\nThis will be Obama’s last U.S.-ASEAN summit, Acharya said. He praised the administration’s approach to the region during the last seven years, saying it has given the U.S. more legitimacy throughout Asia.\n\n“President Obama has been criticized for many foreign policy issues, but I think his relationship with ASEAN is without question a success story,” Acharya said. “The administration has played a very balanced role, it hasn’t been extreme, it’s been very careful in developing good relations with ASEAN.”\n\nObama summit with Asian leaders may boost business\n\nThe challenge now is for the administration to institutionalize that relationship. Economically, the Trans-Pacific Partnership could solidify economic links between Southeast Asia and the U.S., Stubbs said. Politically, the U.S. wants to shore up its position as an ASEAN ally, especially as China continues to gain power in Asia — and ASEAN probably wants the same of the U.S., Acharya said.\n\nObama spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, meaning he has personal links to the region. But a presidential election in November will put the U.S.-ASEAN relationship in someone else's hands. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton helped design Obama's strategy in Asia as Secretary of State, experts said — in 2010, the Center for Strategic and International Studies called her \"fluent in ASEAN\" — but otherwise, foreign policy talk on the campaign trail has focused on China and the Middle East.\n\nIn that vein, Ba cautioned that, as significant as the summit is — it’s one thing to regularize an annual meeting, and another to maintain ASEAN as a diplomatic priority, as Obama has done.\n\n“The regularization of the U.S.-ASEAN summit is something that has taken place under the Obama administration,” Ba said. “I think it’s likely that’s going to continue beyond the Obama administration, but the level of commitment and the level of engagement [with ASEAN] — I think that’s a question mark. That remains to be seen.”\n\nReach Rosalie Murphy at rosalie.murphy@desertsun.com or on Twitter @rozmurph.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/asia/fiji-pacific-climate-change-kiribati-analysis-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "Pacific Island Forum: The US steps up its game as China circles the ...", "text": "Brisbane, Australia CNN —\n\nOn a small group of atollsin the central Pacific Ocean, Kiribati islanders celebrated their Independence Day Tuesday with a President who had skipped the region’s firstface-to-face meeting in three years.\n\nPresident Taneti Maamau not only opted out of the Pacific Island Forum meeting in Suva, Fiji, but withdrew the country from the 18-member group as a matter of principle over a dispute involving its leadership.\n\nSome saw Beijing’s hand in Maamau’s decision to leave the alliance, a claim China’s Foreign Ministry rejected as “completely groundless” during a regular news briefing Monday.\n\nBut on Tuesday, it was the United States’ turn to step forward with incentives for Pacific Island leaders to counter Beijing’s efforts to dominate an increasingly competitive geopolitical tussle in a region of great strategic importance.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters in a call the US was “significantly stepping up (its) game in the Pacific Islands.”\n\nThe incentives included more funding for fisheries, extra aid, and offers of new US embassies in the Pacific – including one in Kiribati, which along with the Solomon Islands appears to be moving closer to China.\n\nThe measures will be personally presented to Pacific leaders Wednesday in a virtual address by US Vice President Kamala Harris – underscoring Washington’s efforts to stress the Pacific’s importance to US strategy.\n\nKanton Island in Kiribati. Gallo Images/Getty Images\n\nIt’s not clear if Kiribati’s decision to pull out of the forum influenced the scale of the US commitment – the US has been promising greater engagement in the region for months as China sought to strike a flurry of deals with Pacific leaders. But Kiribati’s decision to go it alone while tightening its economic and diplomatic ties with China shows the depth of the diplomatic challenges in the region – and the pressure Pacific leaders are under as they try to manage their domestic and regional affairs.\n\n“There’s clear regional and subregional dynamics at play,” said Anna Powles, a senior lecturer at the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at Massey University in New Zealand. “What is unclear is what President Maamau’s gameplan is, what he’s hoping to achieve by withdrawing Kiribati from the forum, and how this will benefit the people of Kiribati.”\n\nChina may deny playing a role in Kiribati’s decision not to attend the forum, but Professor Anne-Marie Brady, a specialist on China’s policies in the Pacific at the University of Canterbury, said Beijing’s influence is clear.\n\n“Kiribati appears to have been given instructions not to attend,” Brady said, based on her observations of China’s recent activity in the Pacific. “The timing of the announcement shows it is meant to be a disruptor to Pacific unity, just when it was about to come up with a collective response on China’s attempt to set up a security treaty in the region.”\n\nThe venue of this year's Pacific Island Forum, Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva, Fiji. Kirsty Needham/Reuters\n\nAn island nation with vast fishing resources\n\nKiribati is a group of 33 atolls scattered over a large area of the central Pacific, covering 3.5 million square kilometers (1.3 million square miles) of ocean – an area larger than India. Around 100,000 people live there under pro-BeijingPresident Maamau, who was re-elected for a second term in 2020.\n\nThree years ago, when the Pacific Island Forum last met in Tuvalu in August 2019, Kiribati was aligned with Taiwan, the democratic island that China’s Communist Party regards as its sovereign territory, despite having never ruled it. But within weeks of the forum, Kiribati followed the Solomon Islands in switching its allegiance to Beijing. And within months, Maamau had met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing to sign a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on China’s Belt and Road initiative. Xi said China was willing to integrate the Belt and Road with Maamau’s 20-year vision (KV20) – from 2016-2036 – to create a “wealthier, happier and peaceful country.”\n\n“Kiribati is absolutely desperate for development, so it will be signing as many development agreements as possible,” said Jessica Collins, a research fellow with the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Island Program. “Thirty percent of Kiribiti’s population live in poverty. You’ve got a growth rate of about 0.3 to 0.6%. They’re really going to be struggling in the current economic climate.”\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi meets Kiribati President Taneti Maamau in Tarawa, Kiribati, on May 27. Xinhua/AP\n\nAccording to Maamau’s KV20 blueprint, success depends on building the country’s key sectors of tourism and fishing. Not only does Kiribati offer access to stunningly beautiful coral reefs, it has one of the world’s largest exclusive economic zones.\n\n“China is very invested in accessing Kiribati’s EEZ and accessing Kiribati’s fisheries,” Powles said. Though it’s unclear what role China played in Kiribati’s decision to leave the forum – if any – Powles said there has been “significant concern about the level and extent of Chinese influence in Kiribati at the highest political levels.”\n\nDiplomatic maneuvers overshadow climate crisis\n\nWashington’s promise of greater support and engagement came at the end of the forum’s first full day, as leaders sought to present a united front over their biggest challenge – the climate crisis.\n\n“The time for slow and steady action has passed,” Vanuatu Prime Minister Bob Loughman told the forum. “The Pacific Islands Forum leaders have called climate change the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of our people.”\n\nTo help the Pacific Island respond to the threat, the US said it and its allies and partners – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – would establish the Partners in the Blue Pacific to support Pacific priorities and boost Pacific regionalism. It mirrors the name of the 50-year Blue Pacific plan the Islands are expected to launch on Thursday – with or without Kiribati.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern arrives in Fiji on July 11 for the Pacific Islands Forum. Ben McKay/AAP/Reuters\n\nOther US commitments include tripling funding to $60 million a year for 10 years to secure US fishing rights in the Pacific, the release of America’s strategy on the Pacific Islands and the appointment of the first US envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum.\n\nTo achieve the US’s soft power goals, the Peace Corps will return to four countries including Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu and the US will increase aid funding to the region.\n\n“What we’re putting on the table is a true partnership based on friendship, and respect and transparency,” said the senior administration official. “What we offer is an affirmative positive agenda to take on short and long term challenges together.”\n\nStrategic importance\n\nFor China and the US, the entire Pacific region offers security and opportunity. But Kiribati’s location offers something special – a potential military port of call, as it has done in the past.\n\nDuring World War II, the US and its allies used the single runway at Canton airport – now called Kanton Island Airport – as an important refueling stop for planes entering and leaving the Pacific.\n\nBut when the war ended, its usefulness as a base waned, and the airport fell into disrepair.\n\nIn 1979, when Kiribati gained independence from Britain, the allied connection to the airport ended, but the US signed the Treaty of Tarawa, giving it the power to veto the use of former US facilities by third parties on Kanton and other islands.\n\n“The treaty says that facilities on the 14 islands where the US formerly claimed sovereignty could not be used for military purposes without the agreement of the US,” Brady said. But she added there are ways around that. “A dual use facility, where the military functions are not immediately activated, could get around that provision.”\n\n“China is looking for a location for military facilities in the Pacific,” she said. “As elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, the way they have been going about this is via dual use port and air facilities.”\n\nLast year Kiribati said China planned to upgrade the airstrip to better connect the islands and improve tourism – a key part of its KV20 blueprint – according to Reuters.\n\nIn May, the Guardian quoted Teburoro Tito, Kiribati’s ambassador to the US and the United Nations, as saying that China had agreed in principle to finance the runway’s upgrade, after the US said financing could take years. “The US turned us down,” Tito said, according to the article.\n\nCNN reached out to the US State Department to confirm the claim but didn’t receive a response.\n\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN Tuesday that China is “exploring the possibility of upgrading Kanton Airport with Kiribati” at the request of the Kiribati government to aid travel within the island country.\n\nThe spokesperson added that China engages in “mutually beneficial cooperation” with Pacific Island nations “based on the concept of community of common destiny, truthfulness and goodwill.”\n\n“China provides assistance to the extent of its ability without any political string attached,” the spokesperson said. “The goal is to develop economy and improve democracy.”\n\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN the US government welcomes contributions to regional development, as long as they adhere to “high standards.”\n\n“As the PRC’s involvement in the region has grown, though, we have seen a range of increasingly problematic behaviors, including its assertion of unlawful maritime claims and the ongoing militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea, predatory economic activities such as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, investments that undermine good governance and promote corruption, and human rights abuses,” the spokesperson said, referring to the country by its formal acronym, the People’s Republic of China.\n\nPacific leaders have a busy agenda over the next two days as they consider the US’s renewed vigor in the region – and any rival offers from Beijing.\n\n“It is immediately obvious that geopolitics have intruded on the forum’s agenda and will be a great distraction,” said Patricia O’Brien, a visiting fellow in Pacific Affairs at Australian National University, before the US released its plan.\n\nAmong leaders’ other priorities will be to continue efforts to bring Kiribati back into the “Pacific family.” Though it remains to be seen if President Maamau sees a brighter future alone –backed by China– and if other Pacific nations will join him.", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/09/putin-xi-biden-g20-summit-india/70768098007/", "title": "No Putin. No Xi. Why Biden views the G20 as essential", "text": "WASHINGTON — For more than two decades, world leaders have gathered at the Group of 20 economic summit to deliver scripted and unscripted remarks behind closed doors and try to work through their differences to reach a consensus on how to best approach pressing global challenges.\n\nIn those unseen moments, officials from rival nations with diverging interests have a shot at building relationships and diplomatic cache that every so often results in a consequential agreement that could not have been forged if dignitaries and their aides had not gathered together in one room.\n\nAt this weekend's summit, the changing dynamics of the G20 will be in sharp relief as two of the biggest players, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, skip the previously unmissable event. Their absence has not deterred President Joe Biden – who has been vigorously testing for COVID-19 after his wife contracted the virus – from making the long journey to India for the gathering that the U.S. is insisting has not lost its gusto.\n\nAmerican presidents have often seized on the forum as an opportunity to engage with authoritarian leaders and steer the outcome toward a more U.S-friendly policy agenda. But now, those same leaders are skipping the G20 as they grapple with economic problems at home and turn their attention to building out alternative multinational organizations and partnerships that they have more control over.\n\n\"For most of its history, the G20 lived up to its promise, but for it to function, the leaders of the major countries in the world have to show up,\" said Daleep Singh, former deputy national security adviser for international economics to Biden. \"Leadership starts with showing up, and there's no substitute for face-to-face communication at the highest levels of government to confront the world's biggest problems.\"\n\nXi and Putin are sending high-ranking representatives from their governments to the gathering of the world's largest economies and the European Union in New Delhi this weekend after expanding membership last month in an economic conglomerate of countries that are more to their liking.\n\n\"We remain committed to the G20 as a critical forum for all of the major economies of the world to come together for global problem-solving,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters last week, stressing that the United States is planning to host the G20 three years from now in 2026.\n\nThe last time Putin attended a G20 leaders' summit in person was in 2019, when Donald Trump was still in office. The gathering was held virtually in 2020. Putin and Xi also participated in the 2021 Rome summit virtually amid the pandemic. Biden attended the summit in person.\n\nA presidential priority\n\nBiden has made international summits such as the G20 and the smaller, more U.S.-aligned Group of Seven, a cornerstone of his foreign policy, taking full advantage of the opportunity to have formal and informal conversations with U.S. allies and countries with which his administration has difficult relations at the multiday functions.\n\n\"He works the room so that there's an element of trust, and then that trust is a form of diplomatic capital that you can trade for real things that matter to people back home. That's his style,\" Singh explained.\n\nAt last year's gathering, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Biden met with his Chinese counterpart in person for the first time since the U.S. leader became president.\n\nAlthough they have had no direct communication since, high-ranking members of their respective governments have traveled between the nations' capitals, and Biden hinted at a meeting this fall with Xi, possibly at a conference for Pacific Rim countries the U.S. is hosting in November, as he expressed disappointment that the Chinese leader would not be in India.\n\n\"It would be nice to have him here, but no the summit is going well,\" Biden commented on Saturday.\n\n'You want to have the difficult conversations'\n\nXi's decision to skip the New Delhi summit comes amid an economic slump, local debt problems and a property crisis. China also faces questions about its relationship with Russia, as Putin wages war in Ukraine and seeks a potential arms deal with North Korea, and has strained relations with G20 host nation India, which has a growing economy.\n\nIf the Chinese leader is avoiding the summit to undercut the G20 as he tries to build up competitor organizations such as BRICS, which includes Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa, that would be a strategic mistake, said Josh Lipsky, a previous G20 sherpa and former adviser at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAs for Biden, he said, \"You want to have the difficult conversations with Xi at the table, because this is the best forum for you to do it, and one of the rare opportunities where it happens. And you do it in a room where you have allies sitting near you, including the rest of the G-7.\n\n\"So most everyone else in that room, including the U.S would prefer that Xi be there, and it is unfortunate that he isn't,\" Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, said. \"I think it's a net negative for the G20, and a net negative, from a U.S. perspective, on what can be achieved out of this summit.\"\n\nBiden's pitch to fellow leaders will not change because the Chinese leader is not in attendance, Sullivan said ahead of the summit. He intends to ask countries in attendance to reform and invest in existing multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF that loan money to developing nations, Biden's national security adviser said.\n\nSullivan said the visit also provided Biden with an opportunity to reconnect with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who the U.S. president met with on Friday before the summit upon his arrival in New Delhi.\n\n\"It's making the best of a bad job. It would be better if Xi were there,\" said Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States and a former U.S. diplomat in Beijing. \"But it's far from a total loss for the United States. It's a chance to see all of these allies, and one of the Biden administration's signature accomplishments has been strengthening our alliances, especially with reference to China, so he can use this meeting now to reinforce that.\"\n\nBiden has the chance at the G20 to make the case for why U.S. leadership abroad is indispensable for the world's peace and stability and why that will pay off for American households, Singh said. He will also be able to demonstrate Russia's isolation for its aggression in Ukraine with Putin and Xi forgoing the summit.\n\n\"The G20 is not going away,\" he said. \"There's too much important work that gets done that almost nobody knows about. But the countries do.

Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDespite the US-China rivalry, the three summits have also brought opportunities to defuse rising tensions and strained communication between the world’s top two powers.\n\nUS-China relations have deteriorated sharply in recent years, with the two sides clashing over Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, North Korea, and the transfer of technology among other issues.\n\nIn August, following a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, China fired multiple missiles into waters around the self-governing island and ramped up naval and warplane exercises in the surrounding area. Beijing claims the democratic island as its territory, despite never having controlled it, and suspended a number of dialogues with the US over the visit.\n\nA landmark meeting between Xi and Biden on the sidelines of the G20 in Bali on Monday – the leaders’ first since Biden took office – ended with the two sides agreeing to bolster communication and collaborate on issues like climate and food security.\n\nAfter landing in Bangkok Thursday, Chinese leader Xi sat down with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in the first meeting between leaders of the two Asian countries in nearly three years. Both sides called for more cooperation following a breakdown in communication over points of contention from Taiwan to disputed islands.\n\nSeeking consensus\n\nAt stake in the broader meeting, however, is whether leaders can find consensus on how to treat Russia’s aggression in a concluding document, or whether differences in views between the broad grouping of nations will stymie such a result, despite months of discussion between APEC nations’ lower-level officials.\n\nLeaders are expected to support a proposal based around a Thai government-backed initiative to promote sustainability, but the summit has faced some pushback in the country. Thai officers dispersed a crowd of protesters walking to the APEC summit venue on Friday, the police said in a statement.\n\nProtest organizer Patsaravalee Tanakitvibulpon said in a Facebook post the police had used force, including firing rubber bullets, to stop those demonstrating against the summit.\n\nAnd whether leaders will come together on a further statement addressing the global economic situation remains to be seen as of Friday.\n\nIn an address to business leaders alongside the summit Friday morning, French President Emmanuel Macron, who was invited by host country Thailand, called for consensus and unity against Moscow’s aggression.\n\n“Help us to convey the same message to Russia: stop the war, respect the international order and come back to the table,” he said.\n\nMacron also called out the US-China rivalry, warning of the risk to peace if countries are forced to choose between the two great powers.\n\n“We need a single global order,” Macron said to applause from business leaders.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/26/meet-greta-thunberg-young-climate-activists-filed-complaint-united-nations/2440431001/", "title": "You know Greta Thunberg.

It is the most widely-ratified human rights treaty in history.\n\n\"The argument is that by not doing enough to mitigate or adapt to climate change, the respondents have failed to fulfill the duty to serve the interests of the children's right to life, health and culture,\" said Erica Lyman, a professor of international environmental law at Lewis & Clark College.\n\nIf the young climate activists win in their complaint, the United Nations will make recommendations to those five countries based on their obligations under the treaty.\n\n\"While the recommendations are not legally binding, these nations have committed to follow the recommendations,\" according to a statement from Earthjustice, which is representing the young activists. \"The obligations spelled out under the Convention on the Rights of the Child are binding.\"\n\nLyman said the United Nations would tell the countries that the children's rights are not being protected and that they are \"disregarding and not fulfilling their obligations to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\"\n\n\"These children want recognition that current trends suggest that their inheritance is a climate change crisis, and they want bold, brave, and precautionary action to mitigate it,\" she said.\n\n'How dare you?':Read Greta Thunberg's emotional climate change speech to UN and world leaders\n\nIn a press conference Monday announcing the complaint, the 16 young climate activists ranging in age from 8 to 17 stood shoulder-to-shoulder explaining the toll climate change has had on their communities.

Some have a history of climate activism, while others only recently were galvanized to act.\n\nThough Thunberg's thundering and direct address to the United Nations General Assembly elicited the most media attention, these young people at the conference are just as outspoken.\n\n\"This is the right thing to say, and this is the truth, and this is our life that is being harmed and our future,\" said Brazilian activist Catarina Lorenzo, 12.\n\nCarlos Manuel, a 17-year-old who lives in Palau, a small island country in the western Pacific Ocean, criticized larger nations that are creating the most emissions.\n\n\"I want bigger countries to know that us small island nations are the most vulnerable countries to be affected by climate change,\" he said. \"Our homes are being slowly swallowed up by the ocean.\"\n\nBelow is a look at who the young activists are, according to information from the complaint. Though they're from all across the world, they're unified by their stories of climate change ravaging their homes and livelihoods.\n\nGreta Thunberg, 16; Stockholm, Sweden\n\nThe most well-known of the group is Greta Thunberg, who started skipping school on Fridays in Sweden to protest political inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament. Through social media, her #FridaysForFuture protests spread globally.\n\nAnd she's become the face of the youth movement. In August, she sailed from the United Kingdom to New York City on a two-week zero-emissions boat voyage. The trip was so she could attend the United Nations meeting on climate, where she passionately called out politicians again for their inaction.\n\nYou may like:6 things to know about teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg\n\nCarl Smith, 17; Akiak, Alaska\n\nA member of the indigenous Yupiaq tribe, Carl Smith learned how to hunt and fish from Yupiaq elders.

She's spent her childhood learning how to raise reindeer, but climate change has resulted in starvation and mass death of the population.\n\nThreats to their food supply are caused by warming and rain, which forms a layer of ice and makes grazing difficult, according to Åshild Ønvik Pedersen, an ecologist at the Norwegian Polar Institute.\n\nRaslen Jbeli, 17; Tabarka, Tunisia\n\nRaslen Jbeli grew up in Tabarka, where, in recent years, climate change has created conditions for \"four seasons in one day.\"\n\nIn 2017, there were 146 wildfires in Tabarka, a far cry from the 37 wildfires from a year before. Last year, a wildfire burned through his neighborhood — his home was spared, but \"it burned down many of our neighbors' homes.\"\n\nFloods are also frequent, shutting down his school for weeks at a time. Once, overflowing rivers fatally swept away children walking home from school.\n\nAlexandria Villaseñor, 14; New York City, New York\n\nAlexandria Villaseñor drew national attention after the Paradise fires in 2018, which ravaged her health, exacerbated her asthma and resulted in anxiety and panic attacks. She relocated to New York City, where she ended up bedridden and hospitalized from her asthma due to the city's poor air quality.\n\nInspired by Greta, she's led Fridays for the Future strikes in the United States — and has led a youth organization of her own creation called Earth Uprising. The non-governmental organization \"mobilizes youths\" to spark actions in their own communities.\n\nChiara Sacchi, 17; Haedo, Argentina\n\nChiara Sacchi said an \"unthinkable\" windstorm ravaged her neighborhood in recent years, blowing the roofs off her neighbors' homes and flooding the land. She also said power outages caused by intense heat prevent her from doing homework.\n\nShe's involved with Terra Madre, an Italian organization with a global network that works to aid small-scale farmers and food producers who are affected most by climate change.\n\nCatarina Lorenzo, 12; Salvador, Bahia, Brazil\n\nAn aspiring surfer, Catarina Lorenzo lives by the largest reef in Brazil, the Abrolhos Bank reef. Climate change, she says, has resulted in a lack of rain, causing water shortages and forest fires, including those in the Amazon.\n\nShe said when it does rain, the storms are so severe that it results in evacuation. The Brazilian government also opens up the sewage system in these floods, pushing sewage overflow into the rivers and oceans.\n\nIris Duquesne, 16; Bordeaux, France\n\nIris Duquesne was born in 2003, the year a heat wave killed about 14,000 people in France — and at least 30,000 across Europe, per Encyclopedia Britannica. Extreme weather events have been a constant in her life, including Cyclone Xynthia, which flooded the city in 2010 and caused her to develop a fear of rain.\n\nStorms and heat have affected the economy in her hometown of Bordeaux, the world's most famous wine region. In 2019, Bordeaux took the unprecedented measure of using nontraditional grapes in its namesake wine — an effect of climate change causing the grapes commonly used in Merlot to over ripen.\n\nRaina Ivanova, 15; Hamburg, Germany\n\nThe city of Hamburg, which is known for its canals, has suffered from heat waves, resulting in the cancellation of boat services due to \"dangerously low\" water levels in the city's rivers.\n\nHowever, storms have gotten so severe that the same canals overflow, flooding Hamburg's streets. When Cyclone Herwert ravaged the city in 2017, it forced Raina Ivanova to wade through knee-deep water to walk to school.\n\nRaina participates in Fridays for the Future, Greta's initiative, where she draws signs and \"sings songs about the climate\" with her friends.\n\nRidhima Pandey, 11; Haridwar, India\n\nRidhima Pandey has taken legal action against her country for not taking effective measures against climate change. In 2017, at the age of 9, she sued the Indian government for \"not acting as they should to prevent climate change.\" Her petition is pending in the Supreme Court of India.\n\nShe lives by the Ganges River, a sacred river that has been affected by pollution. It begins at the Himalayas, but by the time it reaches the sea, per Reuters, it turns into toxic sludge due to ineffective flood infrastructures. When it floods during storms, she says, it closes schools and streets. Stagnant water also creates a prime environment for mosquitoes, which resulted in her mother suffering from typhoid.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/26"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/defence/961481/natos-new-plans-to-defend-europe-from-putin", "title": "Nato's new plans to defend Europe from Putin | The Week", "text": "Nato members are set to approve the most comprehensive shake-up of the alliance’s defence plans since the end of the Cold War.\n\nFrom its founding in the late 1940s to the end of the 1980s, Nato’s primary focus was on preparing for war in Europe with the Soviet Union and its allies. But the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by the collapse of the USSR and Warsaw Pact in 1991, shifted attention to expansion eastwards.\n\nThree decades later, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, countering Moscow on the battlefield is again topping the agenda as Nato leaders prepare to meet next week for their annual summit.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine is seeking an invitation to join the alliance when the war ends, and Turkey is continuing to block Sweden’s accession.\n\nMembers are also at odds over Nato’s approach to the growing influence of China in Europe and whether to open an office in Tokyo.\n\nBut “it is the planned overhaul of Nato’s military machinery that is the most consequential item on the agenda”, said The Economist.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nLed by US General Chris Cavoli, who serves as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, the new 4,000-page plan sets out how to deploy up to 300,000 troops on the alliance's eastern flank within 30 days. The “centrepiece” is a trio of regional plans: one for the north and Atlantic area; in the centre, which covers the Baltic and central Europe down to the Alps; and a southern plan for the Mediterranean and Black Sea. There are also sub-plans for space, cyber operations and special forces.\n\nMatthew Van Wagenen, a US general in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, told the site that the plans represented the “most dramatic change” since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the defence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will be “one of the main topics” at next week’s summit. The recent revolt by Wagner mercenaries in Russia raised “deep security concerns” in the Baltic states and Poland after a deal was reached allowing the group’s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to take refuge in Belarus.\n\nPlans by Vladimir Putin to move nuclear weapons into Belarus risk escalating the situation further.\n\nWill Nato’s new plans work?\n\nThe “first and most important purpose” of the new strategy is “deterrence”, said The Economist. The key point of Nato war plans, said Tim Sayle, a historian at the University of Toronto, “has always been that Moscow knows there are Nato war plans”.\n\nBut while having plans is one thing, being able to carry them out is quite another.\n\nThe alliance has been boosted by the accession of Finland, and could benefit further if Sweden gets the green light to join. As Nato reshapes its strategy in response to Russia's campaign, “access to these new territories and their infrastructure opens ways for allies to watch and contain Moscow”, said Reuters, “and an unprecedented chance to treat the whole of northwest Europe as one bloc”.\n\nHowever, the new strategy requires agreement on re-prioritisation in procurement and investment, especially in heavy weaponry such as jets, tanks and artillery.\n\nLast week, Nato member countries took part in a “force generation conference” to determine how many troops and how much equipment the alliance might have to respond to any Russian attack, both in the short and longer term. The Economic Times reported that officers were “upbeat” about the results.\n\nBut experts and even some Nato diplomats “have expressed doubt about the willingness of member countries to put a total of 300,000 troops on stand-by”, the site added.\n\nThe plans also highlight Europe’s continued dependence on the US, raising concerns about what might happen if American forces were needed to tackle events elsewhere in the world. If a crisis were to erupt in Taiwan for example, which would require the rapid redeployment of US troops to the Asia-Pacific region, “Europe could find itself worryingly exposed”, said The Economist.\n\nCritics of the plans may also point out that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “while catalysing reforms, has also cast doubt on whether the threat it poses to Nato members is as great as was previously thought”, the site added.\n\nThe chair of Nato’s Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, agreed that the war in Ukraine has depleted Russia’s land army, but warned that \"we should never underestimate the Russians and their ability to bounce back”.\n\n\"They might not be 11ft tall, but they are certainly not 2ft tall,” Bauer told reporters in Brussels this week. “We will continue to look at them as a serious threat, in the maritime, and in the air especially, and in space, they are still very, very capable, let alone of course in nuclear.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Joel Mathis", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/06"}]}

Part of the reason some fans were disappointed by the finale is many expected this battle, plus one other major event from the book that's coming up soon, to occur in Season 2.\n\nDuring a featurette that aired after Sunday's finale, showrunner Ryan Condal teased that while Season 2 was about the \"fits and starts\" of war, Season 3 will be \"about total war.\"\n\n'Could've been an email':House of the Dragon finale leaves fans wanting more\n\n'House of the Dragon' renewed for Season 3\n\nDespite fan disappointment with the Season 2 finale, the series isn't going anywhere, as \"House of the Dragon\" was renewed for Season 3 ahead of the Season 2 premiere.\n\n\"George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of 'House of the Dragon,'\" said HBO programming Executive Vice President Francesca Orsi in a statement. \"We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart.

After the long wait between Season 1 and Season 2, fans shouldn't expect to see Season 3 before 2026. Season 2 began production in April 2023 and premiered in June 2024, so based on that timeline, Season 3 could be eying a return around summer 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, another \"Game of Thrones\" prequel series, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" will air on HBO in 2025. Based on Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg,\" it follows the adventures of a knight named Ser Duncan the Tall and Prince Aegon Targaryen. A brief teaser for the show was released on Sunday.\n\nHow many seasons will 'House of the Dragon' last?\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Condal addressed how many seasons \"House of the Dragon\" will last. \"I think it's four,\" he said, according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\nMartin previously said he expects \"House of the Dragon\" to last at least four seasons.\n\n\"It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,\" the author wrote on his blog in 2022. In January, Martin also said he had been discussing the \"third and fourth seasons\" with Condal and the show's writers.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Deadline, Orsi said the series will likely not have \"any less than four\" seasons and teased that there \"could be more.\"\n\n'Game of Thrones'star Kit Harington says Jon Snow spinoff is no longer in the works\n\nWill there be any new characters in 'House of the Dragon' Season 3?\n\nFor book readers, one of the biggest questions throughout Season 2 was when, or if, the show would introduce Nettles.\n\nIn \"Fire & Blood,\" Nettles is a major fan-favorite character who comes into play during the \"dragonseed\" storyline, in which numerous new dragonriders come forward. Described in the book as a \"small brown girl\" who grew up homeless, she was nowhere to be found in Season 2. The events of Sunday's finale strongly suggested that Nettles has been cut from the show, with aspects of her storyline given to Daemon's daughter Rhaena instead.\n\nOne character expected to be introduced in Season 3, though, is Alicent's other son Daeron. He has remained off screen for the entire series but was mentioned in Season 2, and his dragon Tessarion could be seen at the end of the finale, suggesting his proper introduction is imminent. No casting for Daeron has been announced.\n\nHow to watch 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 on HBO, Max\n\nThe Emmy-winning series airs on HBO.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSo yes, there is more good stuff this time (they finally have figured out, at least by Episode 4, what to do with those darned dragons), but there is also more bad stuff: Multiple scenes in which common sense and logic has flown out the window, more twists and surprises introduced without context or feeling to back them up and more gratuitous violence that borders on outright indecency. There are too many side quests and not enough stakes to make me care about the battle for the Iron Throne that is meant to be the crux of the series.\n\nSo yeah, what's happening with that battle? When we left our terrible Targaryens, we had two heads of state vying for that pointy chair: Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), the petulant child of the late king and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke), who thinks being king means he gets to play with all the cool toys. He is being propped up by his mother, grandfather Otto (Rhys Ifans) and psychopathic brother Aemond (Ewan Mitchell).\n\nGlowering over on an island is Aegon's older half-sister, Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy), who was promised the throne by her late father but has a nasty habit of angering everyone else at court. She's backed by husband (and uncle!) Daemon (Matt Smith), in-laws/cousins the Velaryons (Eve Best and Steve Toussaint) and her kids (whom everyone knows are bastards but have to pretend otherwise).\n\nThere are a few dozen other characters that you may or may not remember, and it would take more time to explain them than the show spends reintroducing them. They're all angry and either fighting a dumb war or on the verge of one. The writers (and the marketing team) would like to boil it down to a simple conflict of \"green versus black.\" That's green for Aegon and Alicent, black for and Rhaenyra and Daemon, and bloody death for everyone else.\n\nIn the first four (of eight) episodes made available for review, these disparate characters mix together to create something bad, but also fine, and maybe sometimes good. Smith, one of the great actors of his generation, is completely wasted, puttering and pouting about. The battles are better, and (finally) adequately lit. But the plot twists are based on logical fallacies and require too much suspension of disbelief. Some things are far too easy − assassins creep into castles unchallenged, dragons fly across vast expanses of land in the blink of an eye − and some things are far too difficult and convoluted. Who's fighting? Where? Why? Who is loyal to whom, or is it all just arbitrary? How many sons does Alicent have? And is Cooke really only two years older than the actor who plays her son?\n\nAt times, it's hard not to be absolutely furious at this show. The writers consistently pick the less interesting, less challenging storytelling choice. There is so much lost potential in every boring decision and lackluster line reading. When so much time, energy and money is invested in a series like \"Dragon,\" when there is so much labor from so many actors and crew members, the finished product has to be worth all this effort. When I see dragons battling in the sky, their riders had better have as much glory, magnetism and power as those CGI beasts. So far, these bickering Targaryens can't measure up to the great heroes and villains of the best days of \"Thrones.\"\n\nLet's hope the rest of the season can build on a solid fourth episode and reach a climax that thrills and shocks the audience.\n\nBut if it collapses under the weight of hype again, this \"House\" will forever remain a hollow one.\n\nLooking for reliable local streaming options?

Gregory and Hyacinth are far too young, which leaves Benedict and Eloise. So, who is it going to be?\n\nHere's what we know about Season 4 of \"Bridgerton\" so far, including cast and release date.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Bridgerton' twist:Does it signal queer romance to come?\n\nWill there be 'Bridgerton' Season 4?\n\nYes. In April 2021, a few months after the Season 1, Netflix announced that \"Bridgerton\" would be renewed for Season 3 and 4.\n\n\"Esteemed members of the Ton. It seems we have a rather special announcement,\" Netflix had said in their announcement. \"'Bridgerton' shall return for seasons three and four. This author shall have to purchase more ink...\"\n\n'Bridgerton' Season 4 release date\n\nNetflix hasn't exactly been consistent as far as \"Bridgerton\" release dates are concerned.\n\nThe first season released in December 2020 and the second season landed a little more than a year after in March 2022. However, Season 3 took its sweet time, coming just over two years later and in separate parts. Part 1 of Season 3 dropped May 16, while Part 2 released on June 13. In between Seasons 2 and 3, Netflix released \"Queen Charlotte,\" a spinoff from the \"Bridgerton\" series with none of the main Bridgerton siblings.\n\nNetflix has not yet announced the details for Season 4, but showrunner Jess Brownell, speaking to The Hollywood Reporter at the U.K. premiere for Part 2 Wednesday night, said fans can expect a wait of up to two years.\n\n\"We are working to try and put the seasons out more quickly, but they do take eight months to film and then they have to be edited and then they have to be dubbed into every language,\" Brownell told THR. \"And the writing takes a very long time as well, so we're kind of on a two-year pace, we're trying to speed up, but somewhere in that range.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the Los Angeles Times, Brownell revealed that the next season will begin filming in the fall and that the next season may have a warmer vibe to it compared to the pastels and spring-like feel of the last three seasons.\n\n'Bridgerton' Season 4 lead couple\n\nNetflix and the cast and creators of \"Bridgerton\" have been rather tight-lipped over which Bridgerton sibling will be leading Season 4. Will it be the free-willed Eloise (Claudia Jessie) or the second-born son Benedict (Luke Thompson) or even Francesca, whose story is not yet complete? The producers haven't followed Quinn's chronology, switching things up to surprise audiences.\n\nWhen the first part of Season 3 released in May, Jessie, in an interview with USA TODAY, said: \"I don't know anything. But I'm going to be so brokenhearted when I have to stop playing Eloise. I just want to be here as long as I can.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party!Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox\n\nAt the end of Season 3, Eloise departs for Scotland to live with her younger sister Francesca at her husband, the Earl of Kilmartin's estate there, in order to see more of the world before she can \"attempt\" to change it. However, she tells big brother Benedict that she will return before their mother's masquerade ball, where Benedict is expected to meet his love interest Sophie Beckett, if the books are anything to go by.\n\nThompson, meanwhile, in a recent interview with USA TODAY tried to evade the question, coyly saying: \"Oh, my God, no. I don't even know if it is next season.\"\n\n\"I couldn't possibly comment. I know nothing,\" he said, adding that he's excited to eventually \"deep dive\" into Benedict's character.\n\nBenedict, at the end of Season 3, ended things with Lady Tilly Arnold, telling her that he was enjoying his freedom and wanted to explore more of the world. Tilly was hoping for a more substantial relationship with the Bridgerton brother, telling him that even \"merriment can grow tiresome.\" That conversation seemed to have resonated with Benedict and in his parting shot, he appears to be at a crossroads over his future.\n\n“I’m really excited about what we’re writing,\" Brownell told THR. \"We’re towards the end with the writers room season, with the scripts. And I feel like it’s some of my best work and my writers room’s best work. We’ve just really gelled our collaboration, and we’re firing on all cylinders so I can’t wait for fans to see what we have.”\n\nInterview:Luke Thompson talks 'Bridgerton's' next season, all things Benedict\n\nWho will play Sophie Beckett?\n\nNetflix has not yet announced if Benedict will be leading Season 4 and have also not revealed who will be playing his love interest from the books, Sophie Beckett, the illegitimate daughter of Richard Gunningworth, the Earl of Penwood, and a maid.\n\nBrownell told TVLine that “for any character’s season, we try to save all the big building blocks of their season for their season.\"\n\n\"When we start out any season, we want our protagonists to be at the very beginning of their journey in many ways and to still have a lot of room for growth so that we can really dig in,\" Brownell said.\n\n'Bridgerton' cast\n\nWhile Netflix has not yet announced cast details for Season 4 of \"Bridgerton,\" it is likely that much of the recurring cast would be returning for the new season, though some of them may have limited screentime, based on previous trends. Viewers can also expect to see new characters such as Micheala Stirling, who made a brief appearance at the end of Season 3.\n\nMeanwhile, here's a list of actors and their characters in Season 3 of \"Bridgerton\":\n\nLuke Newton as Colin Bridgerton\n\nNicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington\n\nClaudia Jessie as Eloise Bridgerton\n\nLuke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton\n\nJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton\n\nSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma\n\nRuth Gemmell as Violet Bridgerton\n\nHannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton\n\nVictor Alli as Lord John Stirling (the Earl of Kilmartin)\n\nMasali Baduza as Michaela Stirling, Lord John's cousin\n\nFlorence Hunt as Hyacinth Bridgerton\n\nWill Tilston as Gregory Bridgerton\n\nGolda Rosheuvel as Queen Charlotte\n\nAdjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury\n\nJulie Andrews as Lady Whistledown\n\nLorraine Ashbourne as Mrs. Varley\n\nHarriet Cains as Philipa Featherington\n\nBessie Carter as Prudence Featherington\n\nJessica Madsen as Cressida Cowper\n\nMartins Imhangbe as Will Mondrich\n\nPolly Walker as Portia Featherington\n\nDaniel Francis as Marcus Anderson\n\nSam Phillips as Lord Debling\n\nWho is Michaela Stirling?\n\nAt the end of Season 3, viewers are introduced to a new character Michaela Stirling, who is the cousin of Earl of Kilmartin, Lord John. Michaela, who will be accompanying Eloise, John and Francesca to Scotland, leaves Francesca slightly flustered as she introduces herself.\n\nBrownell, in an interview with Glamour, confirmed that Michaela will be playing Francesca's love interest, and that they have planned a queer romance for the character.\n\nThe showrunner, in her interview, said when she first read Francesca's book \"When He Was Wicked,\" she \"really related to it as a queer woman,\" explaining how the book \"talks a lot about how different she feels.\"\n\n\"I think Julia Quinn's intention in the book is just that Fran feels different because she's introverted. But for many of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different is a part of our stories,\" Brownell said in the interview, adding that she felt like \"there was fertile ground thematically in her book to nod toward telling a queer story\" with a happy ending.\n\n\"It was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple,\" Brownell said.\n\nIn the books, John and Francesca have a blissful marriage, until John dies from a brain aneurysm. His best friend, Micheal, who is secretly in love with his wife, becomes the Earl and takes over the estate. However, devastated from his friend's death, Michael flees to India to grieve. However, when he returns years later, Francesca is seeking a second husband to start a family and the two end up falling in love and getting married.\n\nHow many seasons will 'Bridgerton' have?\n\n\"Bridgerton\" is slated for eight seasons, given that there are eight books in Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series.\n\nBrownell told TVLine that the producers are \"aiming for eight seasons,\" and \"want every sibling to have their own season.\"\n\nExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes also previously said they plan to adapt all eight Bridgerton books into eight seasons for Netflix.\n\nSo, stay tuned, gentle reader.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Sound good?\n\nOnward:\n\nA while back you said you got a SodaStream. I was thinking about getting one for my wife, but I don't know anyone that owns one. Do you still use yours? Taste good? Does it really save money? -- BIG BUSINESS in Cleveland\n\nI still use my SodaStream all the time, but to be honest, I don't think I've made any soda since I got pregnant -- I've just been using it to make sparkling water. For that alone, I'd say it's worth it (and previously my favorite flavors were diet root beer and ginger ale). It's super-easy to use, and the carbonators last a really long time. Mine just ran out the other day and I guess I've had the thing about 10 months!\n\nFrom a fellow pregnant lady: Have you been taking in more pop culture dealing with pregnancy? What books, movies, podcasts, etc. have you discovered or revisited to prepare for your upcoming arrival? -- Emily L.\n\n\n\nMy pop-culture habits haven't changed too much; I suspected it before, but being pregnant only reinforced my belief that entertainment aimed at parents-to-be is mostly terrible. I think I'd rather give birth in a barn than watch those TLC shows or What to Expect When You're Expecting. As far as resources are concerned, I have downloaded a few baby-related apps and, of course, read a bunch of books. (The straight-up informational titles are far more useful than the kitschy ones with cute covers.)\n\nI will say that friends have sent me some fun CDs, like Rockabye Baby!'s lullaby versions of Smiths and Depeche Mode songs. I might listen to those even without the kid! Another good one is a collection of kid-friendly songs written by Woody Guthrie. That's called Daddy-o-Daddy and features renditions by Billy Bragg, Syd Straw and others.\n\nThanks to your suggestion a couple of years ago, I became a fan of the Canadian TV show Being Erica. The first three seasons aired on SOAPnet. The fourth season has aired in Canada, but there's no info about it airing in the States. Do you have info about this? -- Amanda P.\n\nI think SOAPnet abandoned its allegiance to Erica, but you can buy a used DVD set on Amazon. The fourth season wrapped up the series; star Erin Karpluk had a good run on the CW's Life Unexpected before that show was axed, too.\n\nQUESTION FOR READERS: I'm getting married in less than three weeks. We're still trying to pick out all of our songs, so I thought I'd reach out and see if any readers have suggestions! Right now The Pogues'Rainy Night in Soho is in the lead for first dance. We need a good one for the \"recessional\" and for something called the \"grand entrance.\" -- Kendra, Los Angeles\n\nIf any of you guys have ideas (or have gotten married recently), feel free to chime in. Personally, I've always been a sucker for Raspberry Beret, but I guess that would be an odd pick for your grand entrance.\n\nAre you watching the new season of The Great Food Truck Race? What's your feeling about the show featuring teams who don't own food trucks? Do you have a favorite team? -- BIG BUSINESS in Cleveland\n\nI've seen a couple episodes, though I believe the series did itself a disservice by recruiting food-truck novices. I think the people who do operate food trucks often have an independent, renegade spirit that makes for great TV. And when I watch a competition show like this, I want to see people at the top of their game, not mediocre talents whose primary dream is to win a reality show.\n\nThat said, I think Seoul Sausage has it in the bag.\n\nOne of my favorite shows is the unintentionally hilarious Pregnant in Heels, which has self-proclaimed baby expert Rosie Pope giving help to couples about to have a baby. I was thinking that you and Mr. Whit should give her a call and have her help you through this pregnancy.\n\nWhile the episode would feature Chucks instead of heels, what would you like to have Rosie help you out with?- Mike V.\n\nI've seen that show, which also supports my belief that entertainment for expectant parents is abysmal! Rosie seems almost as nuts as her clients, which all have way more money than they have sense.\n\nThough I doubt Rosie and I would get along very well -- aside from the footwear, this is a woman who live-tweeted the birth of her most recent child -- I suppose she could come over and help organize the baby's room. Of course, that would require her to leave the Upper East Side for Brooklyn, and I really don't see that happening!\n\nWhat is your favorite Seinfeld episode and why? -- Tim G.\n\nTim, you're touching upon a favorite subject, as I watch Seinfeld almost every night. I don't know if I can pick an all-out favorite, though \"The Parking Garage\" is up there. I love how all of the action takes place in one setting, yet there's so much going on with each character.\n\nCertain scenes from the show still make me laugh hysterically, even though I've seen them a million times. The other night I watched the ep where Jerry and George contemplate the lyrics of Leslie Gore's Downtown -- priceless. And I love the episode where Kramer starts smoking a pipe and Jerry notices his appearance has changed. (\"Look away, I'm hideous!\")\n\nI could go on and on, but I'll stop there ...\n\nMy husband and I were huge fans of Men of a Certain Age and bought the Season 1 DVDs. Have you heard when Season 2 might be released? That season was even better than the first, and I want to add it to my collection! -- Michele C.\n\nThe set is scheduled for a December release with commentary, deleted scenes, etc.\n\nNow that you are watching Sons of Anarchy, would you do a recap of it like you do with other shows? Last night's premiere was awesome! -- Melissa G.\n\nIt was a good premiere, though that one scene (you'll know what I'm talking about) was pretty hard to watch. I don't think I'll be recapping any series regularly right now, mainly because I don't think I'll be around for much longer and wouldn't be able to see the season through. However, I will recap something if it's a particularly notable/game-changing episode ... and Sons generally has some of those.\n\nThanks for all of your questions today!

In May 2023, the finale saw Jason Sudeikis' title character leave AFC Richmond and go home to the United States, seemingly concluding his story.\n\nMembers of the \"Ted Lasso\" creative team had also said they envisioned the show as having a three-season arc.\n\n15 inspirational ‘Ted Lasso’ quotes:Coaches, share these lines with your young athletes\n\n\"We've always meant it to be three seasons,\" producer and star Brendan Hunt previously told Entertainment Weekly. \"I think it would be pretty cool if, in the face of how much everyone likes this show, that we stick to our guns and really just do three seasons. But even as committed to that idea as Jason may have been, none of us were prepared to the degree to which people love this show.\"\n\nBut Apple TV+ notably did not promote Season 3 as the show's last, and Sudeikis and his fellow producers were cagey about whether \"Ted Lasso\" was ending all the way up to the finale. When asked at the Emmys in 2022 whether Season 3 was the end, Sudeikis was evasive. \"It's up to more factors than myself,\" he said.\n\nReview:Don't worry, 'Ted Lasso' Season 3 will bring a bright light to your dark world\n\nEarlier this month, co-creator Bill Lawrence told Collider that the future of the show was still up to Sudeikis.\n\n\"As fans, we'd all kill if it was going again, but everybody would say the same thing, which is: whatever Jason feels like doing and whatever his decision is, we're all down with it,\" he told the entertainment news site.\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" premiered in 2020, the year after the launch of Apple TV+, and quickly became one of the streaming service's most acclaimed shows. It won two consecutive Emmys for best comedy series for its first and second seasons, with Sudeikis, Goldstein and Waddingham also receiving Emmys for their performances.\n\nBut critical response to the third season was more muted than the first two, with USA TODAY TV critic Kelly Lawler writing that the season suffered from \"long, tedious episodes, poor characterization, bad plotting and a general lack of focus.\" Season 3 lost the best comedy series Emmy to the first season of \"The Bear.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/05/04/upcoming-star-wars-movies-tv-shows/73526499007/", "title": "'The Acolyte': Upcoming 'Star Wars' movies, TV shows in the works", "text": "For nearly 50 years, \"Star Wars\" fans have thrilled over the various chapters of the Skywalker Saga on the big screen.

The Western-tinged adventures of \"The Mandalorian\" and politically savvy machinations in \"Andor\" have won over audiences in recent years, and new Disney+ series like \"The Acolyte\" are on the horizon. And while we haven't seen a \"Star Wars\" movie since \"The Rise of Skywalker\" in 2019 (the less we say about that, the better), high-profile films are in development, from Pedro Pascal's Mando and Grogu's biggest adventure yet to the return of Daisy Ridley's heroic Rey.\n\nSo what’s coming and when?

The show, like \"The Mandalorian,\" is set in the New Republic era between \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"The Force Awakens.\" Jude Law and Oscar nominee Kerry Condon (\"The Banshees of Inisherin\") star, and while \"Skeleton Crew\" was originally scheduled to premiere in 2023, it's expected later this year or early 2025.\n\nA second season of acclaimed 'Andor' is on the way\n\n\"Andor,\" a gritty and realistic \"Rogue One\" prequel that won over fans and critics alike, reintroduced Rebel spy Cassian Andor as a young man recruited by members of the Resistance working against the fascistic Empire. Filming wrapped earlier this year on the 12-episode second and final season, which is expected to hit Disney+ in 2025: In a 2022 interview, creator Tony Gilroy explained that Andor goes from being \"someone who could care less about the rebellion\" in the first half of the show to \"becoming a revolutionary\" by its conclusion.\n\nAlso on tap: 'Ahsoka' Season 2 with Rosario Dawson\n\nThe first-season cliffhanger of \"Ahsoka\" left its main characters in quite a pickle, with lightsaber-wielding warrior Ahsoka (Rosario Dawson) and pal Sabine Wren (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) stuck in a far-off galaxy while the returning Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) gathers the remnants of the Empire to be a thorn in the New Republic's side. The good news is that creator Dave Filoni is currently developing a second season to explore how our heroines get out of their jam.\n\nMandalorian and Grogu are ready for their big-screen closeup\n\nThere's no word yet on a potential fourth season of \"The Mandalorian,\" but we're getting the next best thing: \"The Mandalorian & Grogu\" (due May 22, 2026), directed by Jon Favreau, begins filming this year and will feature Pascal's helmeted warrior dad and his powerfully adorable adopted son. It's likely not the last of them at the cinema, either: Filoni is developing an action-packed movie centered on a war between the Imperial Remnant and fledging New Republic that will close out the interconnected stories of Disney+ shows \"Mandalorian,\" \"The Book of Boba Fett\" and \"Ahsoka.\" \"I hope you walk into that theater and whether you've seen a series or not, you enjoy the movie,\" the director told USA TODAY at last year's Star Wars Celebration.\n\nJames Mangold 'biblical epic,' Rey's big return are in the works, too\n\nDaisy Ridley, who played the sequel trilogy's central heroine Rey, will reprise her role in a new film from director Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, an Oscar winner for best documentary short (\"Saving Face\").

Sign up here.\n\nLondon and Abu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA grisly drug-induced homicide captivated the media in Saudi Arabia this April, when a man in the country’s Eastern Province set his family house on fire before iftar, the meal that ends the Ramadan fast. Four members of his family were killed.\n\nPolice said he was under the influence of shabu, a methamphetamine, according to local papers.\n\nSaudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use, with one columnist describing shipments of narcotics to the kingdom as an “open war against us, more dangerous than any other war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country’s history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh.\n\nThe record seizure demonstrates what experts say is Saudi Arabia’s growing role as the drug capital of the Middle East, driving demand and becoming the primary destination for smugglers from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe kingdom, they say, is one of the largest and most lucrative regional destinations for drugs, and that status is only intensifying.\n\nWednesday’s operation was the biggest single smuggling attempt in terms of narcotics seized, according to the General Directorate of Narcotics Control. While authorities didn’t name the drug seized or where it came from, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has previously said that “reports of amphetamine seizures from countries in the Middle East continue to refer predominantly to tablets bearing the Captagon logo.”\n\nCaptagon was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing the synthetic stimulant fenethylline. Though it is no longer produced legally, counterfeit drugs carrying the captagon name are regularly seized in the Middle East, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n\nDrug busts of captagon in Saudi Arabia and around the region have grown over time. Earlier this week, A US Coast Guard boat seized 320 kilograms of amphetamine tablets and almost 3,000 kilograms of hashish worth millions of dollars from a fishing boat in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe drug was popularized in the kingdom some 15 years ago but has taken off more intensely in the past five years, “perhaps becoming on par with cannabis,” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, who has written on the topic.\n\nOne of the reasons captagon is spreading in use is “because there is a supply flood now coming mostly from Syria” where it is produced “on an industrial scale in the chemical factories inherited from the [Assad] regime” and supplied by warlords and affiliates of the regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Center for International Communication didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCaptagon can be sold for between $10 and $25 a pill, meaning the latest Saudi haul, if it was the same drug, has a street value of up to $1.1 billion, based on figures from the International Addiction Review journal.\n\n“Captagon’s amphetamine-type properties are sought out as a coping mechanism that can aid users facing food insecurity in staving hunger, and inducing a euphoric ‘rush’ that users have said to help with traumatic stress,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute in Washington, D.C. who has studied the captagon trade. “It’s also been said that these same traits for captagon have been sought out by foreign workers in wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, seen to aid work performance.”\n\nWhile hashish and khat are also common drugs in the kingdom, amphetamines are popular among Saudi youth. A 2021 study in the journal of Crime, Law and Social Change cited a user as saying, “captagon is small. My school mates and I like it more than hashish. Not like hashish, we can buy in tablet……Once we get 25 riyals from [our] parents, we can buy one tablet and enjoy it.”\n\n“In wealthier consumer markets, the drug has a different appeal, serving as a recreational activity amongst its growing youth population that, despite social reforms… have reportedly struggled with boredom amidst widespread youth unemployment and a lack of opportunities for leisurely activities,” said Rose. “Some consumers have justified captagon as less of a taboo substance, compared to ‘harder’ drugs like opiates and cocaine.”\n\nSince many young people in Saudi Arabia have been taking drugs as a result of boredom and lack of social opportunities, the increased freedoms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could help reduce some of that use, said Felbab-Brown.\n\n“The important thing is neither to curtail the freedoms, nor to turn concerts into places of dragnets and raids, but rather to educate young people,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of drug rehabilitation centers have popped up across the kingdom after the government began licensing private establishments.\n\nKhalid Al Mashari, the CEO of Qaweem, one of the first such centers to open, says around four or five have opened in the past two years. That’s a testament to the government’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation, he says, but it also shows that the problem is on the rise.\n\n“We’re in high demand, unfortunately,” he told CNN. “But at least people have an option now, instead of having to go to neighboring countries to seek treatment.”\n\nDespite the presence of rehabilitation centers, Rose says there is little public health messaging or campaigning to raise awareness about captagon.\n\n“While this taboo regarding drug consumption in the kingdom is not going anywhere, the government’s tendency to exclusively securitize this issue and downplay its role as a destination market will be harder to ignore,” she said.\n\nFelbab-Brown says drug policies in the Middle East have focused on the harshest of responses.\n\n“Unlike large parts of the world [that] have walked away from such rigid and mostly ineffective or outright counterproductive policies, the Middle East has often doubled down on them,” she said. “Imprisoning users is ineffective and counterproductive.”\n\nThe digest\n\nUS says Iran reply on EU proposal for revival of nuclear deal is “not constructive”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the US has received Iran’s reply to the US’ response an EU proposal for the revival of the nuclear deal on Thursday. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive,” said the spokesperson. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani earlier said Tehran’s response was sent after “carefully” examining it and “with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,” according to a statement.\n\nBackground: Earlier this week during a press conference in Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Iran needs guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the nuclear accord and reapply sanctions as happened under the Trump administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The US and Iran have been trading responses to a “final” EU text aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said he hopes the talks can be concluded in a matter of days. French President Macron also said on Thursday he hopes to conclude the talks in the next few days. It’s unclear how the talks will move forward from here as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment and break commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nFour killed during Shiite clashes in Iraq’s Basra\n\nClashes between rival Shiite groups killed four people in Iraq’s Basra on Thursday, as the fallout from the country’s worst political violence in years continues, Reuters reported. Basra is the main oil-producing city in Iraq and now violence has spread from Baghdad to the south.\n\nBackground: The violence began earlier this week in Baghdad when powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced his resignation from political life. That move set off an intense round of political infighting between Iran-backed Shiite groups and al-Sadr’s supporters. Both sides have been trying to exert control since parliamentary elections in October 2021 saw Iran-backed blocs lose seats to Sadrists. Despite his win, al-Sadr failed to form a government amid opposition from his rivals.\n\nWhy it matters: The episode served as a reminder of the fragility of the government in Baghdad, which remained largely neutral in the crisis, as well as the competing players at home and abroad that seek to control the country’s politics.\n\nTurkish pop star could face up to 3 years in prison for joking about religious schools\n\nSinger Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, known as Gulsen, could face a prison sentence of up to three years over comments made during a concert in April, according to a 48-page indictment. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office brought charges of “inciting the public to hatred and enmity,” the indictment said.\n\nBackground: Last week, Gulsen was jailed pending trial after a video circulating on social media showed her making a comment about religious schools in Turkey, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. During a concert in April, Gulsen said, “[He] graduated from Imam Hatip [religious schools.] That’s where his pervert side comes from,” referring to a person on stage. The singer denied the charge, saying it was a joke, and apologized to those offended by her remarks. She has since been released from custody but placed under house arrest. An Istanbul criminal court will assess the indictment and decide to accept or refuse it. If accepted, the hearings will start and Gulsen will be brought before court.\n\nWhy it matters: Gulsen has previously been targeted by Turkish conservative groups for her revealing stage outfits and support for the LGBTQ community. Her recent arrest sparked outrage and support from fans on social media. Some critics say it’s part of a move by Turkish officials to gain support from their religious and conservative base ahead of elections next year.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Abbas Al Lawati", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/politics/abortion-bans-murder-charges-invs/index.html", "title": "These male politicians are pushing for women who receive ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA businessman turned state representative from rural Oil City, Louisiana, and a Baptist pastor banded together earlier this year on a radical mission.\n\nThey were adamant that a woman who receives an abortion should receive the same criminal consequences as one who drowns her baby.\n\nUnder a bill they promoted, pregnant people could face murder charges even if they were raped or doctors determined the procedure was needed to save their own life. Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

Much of the attention was on Nevada, where Republicans chose a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump’s lies about election fraud as their nominee to become the state’s top elections official. In South Carolina, voters delivered the vengeance that Trump had sought as they ousted Rep. Tom Rice, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment last year. But In a district near Rice’s, a one-time Trump critic, Rep. Nancy Mace, narrowly survived a challenge from a Trump-endorsed rival – displaying the difficulty of surviving in a GOP still dominated by the former President without embracing his grievances.

In a move to fight rampant inflation, the central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point – the biggest single hike since 1994. This follows the Fed’s decision to raise rates by half a percentage point in May, the biggest increase in 22 years. So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts say every time the Fed raises rates, it becomes more expensive to borrow. That means higher interest costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, student debt and car loans. Business loans will also get pricier.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Fact-checking Biden's claim that Putin shares blame for inflation 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Ukraine\n\nThe US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages to be sent to Ukraine to help in its fight against Russia at a meeting of nearly 50 countries in Brussels today, according to a senior US defense official. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials say it will be difficult to halt Russia’s progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. This, however, could force a tough decision for Western governments, which have offered immense support to Ukraine at an increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Ukrainian troops try out US-supplied M4 rifles 02:42 - Source: CNN\n\n4. Coronavirus\n\nIn a unanimous decision on Tuesday, FDA advisers voted in favor of authorizing Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for children and teens ages 6 to 17. The FDA, which typically follows the committee’s decisions, will now decide whether to authorize the vaccine for emergency use in these age groups. Moderna’s vaccine has been estimated to be 93.3% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 among adolescents ages 12 to 17 when the original coronavirus and the Alpha variant were dominant, according to an FDA briefing document. The vaccine was estimated to be 76.8% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 for children ages 6 to 11 when the Delta variant was dominant. Pfizer/BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine is approved for people 16 and older, and it’s authorized for use in children as young as 5.\n\n5. UK deportations\n\nThe inaugural flight of a controversial UK government scheme to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda was stopped on Tuesday at the eleventh hour, after an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights. According to the UK’s PA Media news agency, “all migrants have been removed from the plane and the flight to Rwanda will not take off as scheduled tonight.” Britain’s government had announced the deal with the east African country in April. Those people granted asylum would then be allowed to resettle in Rwanda. The government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the English Channel from France.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback UK government to start sending migrants to Rwanda.

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight.

Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn the 1850s, a barroom brawler named John Morrissey took on and defeated some of the leading boxers of the time. Nicknamed “Old Smoke,” the Irish immigrant who grew up in Troy, NY, would go on to mastermind a gambling empire, found the famed Saratoga horse racing track and win a seat in the US House of Representatives. But Morrissey is also known for popularizing one enduring phrase.\n\nChallenging a rival to fight him for stakes of $2,500, Morrissey said, “Now, if he means business, let him put up, or shut up…”\n\nThose last five words were the same ones former White House counsel Pat Cipollone used when he described to House investigators his reaction to the 2020 election deniers in Trump’s inner circle who floated increasingly desperate schemes to overturn the results.\n\n“There was a real question in my mind and a real concern, you know,” Cipollone told the January 6 committee, “particularly after the Attorney General had reached a conclusion that there wasn’t sufficient election fraud to change the outcome of the election when other people kept suggesting that there was. The answer is, what is it? And at some point you have to put up or shut up.”\n\nTrump’s extreme supporters showed “a general disregard for the importance of actually backing up what you say with facts,” said Cipollone.\n\nAnd seizing voting machines, as lawyer Sidney Powell and others suggested during a tumultuous six-hour meeting on December 18, 2020, was “a terrible idea,” he added. “That’s not how we do things in the United States.”\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nCipollone may have killed that bonkers idea, but it didn’t deter Trump from tweeting, shortly after the White House meeting broke up, “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” Trump and his backers never put up real evidence of fraud – but they also didn’t shut up, and the 45th president harps on about it even now as he considers when to announce he will run for the presidency again in 2024.\n\nWill the House select committee’s investigation block Trump’s path back to the White House? Norman Eisen and Fred Wertheimer praised the committee for “a blockbuster series of seven hearings – we would argue the most important ones we’ve seen in a half century.”\n\nTrump’s “will be wild” tweet served as a “siren setting us on the path to the conflagration that was January 6…”\n\nAnd now, the threat to democracy remains, according to Eisen and Wertheimer. “The mob dispersed on January 6 and Trump left the White House, but he and his enablers continue to push the outrageous lie that the 2020 election was stolen. There are over 100 Trump adherents running for federal and state office, over 200 pieces of legislation based on the election fraud lie, and the Supreme Court is set to take up a case that could allow state legislators to do the kinds of things that Trump and his allies sought. With all of this, we face not only a constitutional crisis, but also an existential one.”\n\nAs Michael D’Antonio pointed out, “Among the startling bits of evidence the committee presented was a text message exchange between Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale and former Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson after the riot. Parscale expressed that he was feeling ‘guilty’ for helping Trump become president because his rhetoric had inflamed the mob.\n\n“Pierson texted. ‘You did what you felt right at the time and therefore it was right.’\n\n“‘Yeah. But a woman is dead,’ Parscale replied.\n\n“Pierson said Trump’s rhetoric hadn’t been the cause of the attack. Parscale answered, ‘Katrina. Yes it was.’”\n\nD’Antonio wrote, “If, come 2024, we find ourselves with a candidate Trump on the presidential ballot, this hearing provides a terrifying glimpse of what’s at stake. It should serve as a huge wake up call to voters that they would be electing a man who will let nothing – not the truth or the safety of Americans – stand in the way of his omnipotent aspirations.”\n\nFor more:\n\nNorman Eisen and Dennis Aftergut: Steve Bannon’s new ploy\n\nThe Democrats’ dilemma\n\nDana Summers/Tribune Content Agency\n\nDemocrats seemed determined last week to prove the truth of Leo Tolstoy’s famous line: “All happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” A New York Times/Siena College poll found that 64% of Democratic voters think the party should pick a 2024 candidate other than President Joe Biden. Nearly half of Republicans don’t want Trump to run again either. And while only 13% of American voters think the country is headed on the right track, the poll shows, at this very early stage, that Biden could narrowly defeat Trump in a 2024 rematch.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, made it known that he would block most of the remaining parts of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, to the fury of progressives seeking action on climate change and other priorities. Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman, said Manchin’s stance is understandable: Biden won in 2020 because of the “exhaustion, disgust and contempt so many voters had” for Trump. “The big mistake Biden and Democrats made was believing voters gave them control of Washington, DC, to force a progressive agenda through Congress. On the contrary, voters wanted stability, normalcy and moderation – a fact Manchin is quite willing to remind Biden and his congressional colleagues of.”\n\nEven before Manchin’s pronouncement, Reshma Saujani, founder of the nonprofit Girls Who Code, was deeply dissatisfied with the Democratic Party’s approach. “For millions of Americans, myself included, the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade was a tragedy. But while watching our rights to privacy, choice and bodily autonomy go up in flames was gutting to many of us, it wasn’t surprising – and neither was Democrats’ tepid response.\n\n“In a moment that demanded action, the Democrats gave us… messaging. Lots and lots of messaging. They flooded our inboxes with desperate pleas to donate, our nightly news with hollow soundbites and our Twitter feeds with warnings that low turnout in November would usher in a draconian future that, come to think of it, looks a whole lot like the present.\n\n“If the Democratic Party wants us to mobilize for them en masse – yet again – they need to prove that they’ll actually do something with the power we give them.”\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\nLongtime Democratic strategist Paul Begala wrote that he shares the progressives’ frustration but believes internal party criticism is weakening the President at a critical time.\n\n“The reality is that Biden has, in fact, done a ton of good despite GOP obstructionism. … His policies – especially the child tax credit in his rescue package – reduced child poverty, keeping some six million kids from falling into poverty.\n\n“My message to my progressive friends is this: We’re all in the same boat, so stop poking holes in the boat and then complaining that Biden is getting you wet,” concluded Begala.\n\n“Many young Americans who were keen to vote former President Donald Trump out of office are now profoundly unhappy with Biden as well,” wrote Julian Zelizer, citing the Times’ poll.\n\n“They have experienced firsthand a growing climate crisis, racial injustice, the breakdown of democratic institutions and norms, gender inequity and widespread economic insecurity – issues that have been much discussed but rarely addressed.\n\n“Many of these young people have also grown up participating in active shooter drills at school. Unlike the famous duck-and-cover drills of the 1950s meant to prepare kids for a nuclear war that never happened, this country has witnessed the persistent drumbeat of school shootings. Can we really blame young people for feeling disillusioned with the US political system that allows this to continue?”\n\nThe working class\n\nWriting in his Substack newsletter, Ruy Teixeira pinpointed a “yawning chasm” in voter backing for Democrats, drawing upon on the Times’ poll. “The lack of Democratic support among working class (noncollege) voters is striking. Democrats lose among all working class voters by 11 points, but carry the college-educated by 23 points…\n\n“It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Democrats’ emphasis on social and democracy issues, while catnip to some socially liberal, educated voters, leaves many working class and Hispanic voters cold. Their concerns are more mundane and economically-driven. This is despite the fact that many of these voters are in favor of moderate abortion rights and gun control and disapprove of the January 6th events. But these issues are just not salient for them in the way they are for the Democrats’ educated and most fervent supporters.”\n\nSensing an opportunity as well as a need, Republicans are rallying behind a new version of Sen. Mitt Romney’s proposed Family Security Act which would give working families a cash benefit of $250 to $350 per child per month, according to Oren Cass, executive director of the think tank American Compass. It would be partly funded by eliminating the tax deduction for state and local taxes, which Democrats from high-tax states would no doubt oppose.\n\nBut if it gets off the ground, Cass wrote, “It could offer the best opportunity in a long time for a meaningful, durable, widely supported program to help working families with the costs of raising children. If America is going to have a robust family benefit, it will look something like this.”\n\nSoaring prices\n\nInflation remains a top worry, politically and economically, with June’s index showing consumer prices in the US rising at the highest rate in more than 40 years. (That report covers last month and doesn’t reflect the more recent drop in gasoline and oil prices.)\n\nAs grocery shoppers know, food prices have spiked, partly because Russia’s war on Ukraine is blocking grain and other exports.\n\nTim Benton of Chatham House noted that Ukraine is the fifth largest exporter of wheat and the biggest exporter of sunflower oil. “By impeding the flow of grain from this breadbasket region, food becomes a powerful weapon in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s arsenal. This is nothing new for warmongers. For centuries, siege tactics have been deployed to starve populations.”\n\n“What is new is that this tactic is not being deployed to subjugate the country under attack, but to hurt the world’s most vulnerable to create political leverage for Russia,” Benton wrote. “Exporting stolen grain as ‘Russian’ to Russia’s allies adds further insult to injury.”\n\nBeyond Ukraine though, there are larger questions about food prices. “Over 70 years, we have collectively designed a food system to deliver an excess of calories as cheaply as possible, with little focus on nutrition. The result is ever cheaper and more processed food, through long and complex supply chains, with the health and environmental consequences it brings.\n\n“All that is happening now means the era of cheap food may be over.”\n\nBrittney Griner\n\nKrill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty shed light on the fate of WNBA all-star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia for five months. Griner faces a possible 10-year prison sentence on charges of drug smuggling after customs officials say they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage.\n\n“In relations with Russia, as with Iran and North Korea, American citizens who are not spies have been arrested and held as political ‘hostages,’ bargaining chips to be exchanged for citizens those countries want back,” Dougherty observed.\n\n“With her star quality, Griner would be a valuable asset if Putin did want a prisoner exchange, something Moscow has indicated might be a possibility. … Last week Griner pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charge, telling the judge: ‘But there was no intent. I didn’t want to break the law.’ That admission could help resolve the case, legal experts believe.\n\n“But this highly politicized trial is being decided in the glare of cameras and public outcry, amidst a crisis in diplomatic relations.”\n\nA dangerous road\n\nDriving in a high occupancy vehicle lane meant for at least two people, Brandy Bottone told a police officer who pulled her over in Dallas that her unborn child, due early next month, should count as the second passenger. It didn’t work.\n\n“It seems Texas’s strict anti-abortion law, which defines an ‘unborn child’ as ‘an individual living member of the homo sapiens species,’ only applies when it can be used against women – not when it can help them get out of a traffic ticket,” wrote Jill Filipovic.\n\n“It’s understandable, given how disheartening the last weeks have been for those of us who believe women have a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, to want to cheer for the moments that clarify just how dystopian anti-abortion laws really are. But as satisfying as this gotcha moment might be, establishing a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus as a separate person imbued with the same rights as you or I is a step down a dangerous path. It is absurd to be sure. But it’s also incredibly perilous for women’s rights and for a reality-based society more broadly.”\n\nHistorian Mary Ziegler spotlighted the reaction to the Indianapolis Star’s report of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who had been sexually assaulted – and was six weeks and three days pregnant.It was “three days past the cutoff in her state for legal abortion. The story went viral, with President Joe Biden asking Americans to ‘imagine being that little girl.’”\n\n“And yet the response to the story, for many,” Ziegler pointed out, “was scorn and disbelief. Republican US Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio blasted the story as ‘another lie.’ Ohio attorney general Dave Yost joined Fox News anchors in suggesting that the story had been made up. The Wall Street Journal described the report as ‘too good to be true.’ Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, labeled the story ‘#FakeNews from the liberal media.’”\n\nOnly it wasn’t fake. A 27-year-old man had been arrested, and according to police, he confessed to sexually assaulting the girl, the Columbus Dispatch reported.\n\n“The horrific story of one little girl in America is not just a reminder that we still struggle to believe women and girls,” wrote Ziegler. “It’s a cautionary tale about how quick we are to demonize some girls and women. If we have worked to trust and support victims of sexual violence, many of us have too often left people seeking abortion out of the equation.”\n\nFor more:\n\nKara Alaimo: The dangers of abortion misinformation\n\nBrad Snyder: The Supreme Court’s red herring argument\n\nTravel chaos\n\nDave Whamond/Cagle Cartoons\n\nThe epicenter of the world’s air travel chaos last week was the busiest airport serving London. Peggy Drexler noted that “on a recent weekday at Heathrow Airport, almost a third of scheduled flights were late; about 2% of all scheduled flights were canceled. … The airport has now asked airlines to stop selling more tickets this summer.”\n\nAs Drexler wrote, demand for travel is high. “Having lost out on traveling farther afield for much of the last two years, many of us assumed we’d finally have the summer we’d been waiting for,” she wrote.\n\nBut now, “suddenly, what had felt like one of our only respites – the classic summer jaunt – feels as stressful as being stuck at home for yet another summer.”\n\n“The key to getting through the challenge of summer travel – should you choose to accept it – will be about managing your expectations, knowing where you fall on the risk/reward spectrum (that is, understanding whether the benefits of travel for you outweigh the very real risks), learning what you can control for yourself and knowing if you can let go of the rest.”\n\nBiden fist bumps MBS\n\nBandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout/Reuters\n\nAfter a trip to Israel, President Biden flew to Saudi Arabia for his much-anticipated encounter with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS).\n\n“Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia was a victory for MBS, as it granted him the recognition he craves,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “That’s why the palace rushed to broadcast the pictures of Biden fist bumping the prince – never mind that Biden likely meant it as a sign of chilliness. If the Saudis raise oil and natural gas output, helping ease the price of fuel as the West prepares for winter without Russian gas supplies; if they loosen more restrictions on women; if they allow now-restricted American citizens to leave the country, then we will know it was worth it.\n\n“It was a gamble. Let’s hope it pays off.”\n\nThere was strong incentive for visiting the nation which candidate Joe Biden had labeled a “pariah” after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi: “high gas prices are contributing to the worst inflation in the United States in four decades,” as Peter Bergen noted.\n\n“Every US president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has made similar calculations of the kind that Biden is making about the House of Saud. Sure, the Saudi monarchs may be despots – slavery was only officially abolished in the kingdom in 1962, and MBS granted women the right to drive four years ago – but Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s top oil producers and has around a sixth of the world’s proven oil reserves, which means that the Saudis can open up the taps and let the price of oil fall, or they can close the taps and the price of oil will rise.\n\n“Relations between nations are based on shared interests, and the US-Saudi relationship is bound up not only with ensuring a steady supply of reasonably priced oil but also with counterterrorism initiatives and efforts to try and contain Iranian influence in the region,” Bergen wrote.\n\nFor more:\n\nAaron David Miller: Biden is heading to the Middle East for one simple reason\n\nTrump and Musk breakup\n\nKevin Siers/Cagle Cartoons\n\nElon Musk wants out of his costly deal to buy Twitter – and the company has gone to court to try to force him to go ahead with the purchase. Fallen by the wayside is Musk’s avowed intention to restore Donald Trump’s Twitter account, which was permanently suspended after the January 6 riot.\n\nAs Dean Obeidallah wrote, the Trump-Musk bromance is over. “It wasn’t that long ago that the Trump-Musk relationship was warm, complete with public displays of affection. In January 2020, Trump likened Musk to Thomas Edison, gushing that he’s ‘one of our great geniuses … and we want to cherish those people.’”\n\n“Musk is a ‘bulls**t artist,’ Donald Trump bellowed to applause at a rally in Alaska … the former President made the remark in response to Musk’s recent comment that he had never voted for a Republican before a June special election in Texas,” Obeidallah noted.\n\nThe former President claimed that Tesla’s chief executive had told him he voted for Trump. Meanwhile, Musk indicated he is leaning toward supporting another potential 2024 Republican candidate – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDon’t miss\n\nShannon Watts: A setback for the ‘guns everywhere’ lobby\n\nRaul Reyes: These GOP Latina candidates are not the ‘real deal’\n\nHolly Thomas: Boris Johnson’s greatest disappearing trick of all\n\nAND…\n\nA star is born\n\nWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content Agency\n\nThe James Webb space telescope, the largest one ever, began to reveal its riches last week, with the release of a series of stunning photographs that reached far back into the history of the universe.\n\nNicole Hemmerwas captivated. “The first deep field photograph showed not just unprecedented details of deep space but of deep history: some of the galaxies it captured are – or were – 13.1 billion light-years away, meaning the images we saw offered glimpses of the universe in its infancy.\n\n“At a moment when life on Earth has felt increasingly cramped and shuttered, hemmed in by pandemic shutdowns and border-obsessed nationalisms, getting lost in that vision of the vastness of the universe felt freeing. Tiny, fragile, fractious Earth, not even a blue dot in the crowded crush of galaxies on display in the Webb photographs, is surrounded by endless possibility.”\n\nNASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nWriting for CNN Opinion, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson observed that the Webb telescope alters “our understanding of the universe.”\n\n“These images show Webb’s power in searching for the markers of life and habitability on other worlds. Its extreme sensitivity will help scientists understand some of the great open questions about how and why stars form, and it will bring into clarity stars and galaxies in a way we’ve never seen before. From new-forming stars to devouring black holes, this telescope will reveal all this and more.\n\n“Less than 100 years ago, we discovered that our Milky Way is just one of many throughout our universe. Today, Webb reveals an unprecedented understanding of the billions of galaxies that make up the cosmos.”", "authors": ["Richard Galant"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/middleeast/iran-saudi-cartoons-quran-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Cartoons and Quranic verses form the latest Saudi-Iran battleground ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nThe animated simulation shows a fleet of drones approaching an oil facility belonging to Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company. Air raid sirens are heard with ominous background music as the drones aim at the facility, apparently ready to strike.\n\nThe one-minute video ends with a telling verse from the Quran about God repelling the invaders of Mecca by having them pelted with stones from the sky. “And He sent upon them birds, in flocks,” it says.\n\nThe aircraft have a strong resemblance to Iran’s Shahid suicide drones, which have been in the headlines lately for wreaking havoc in Ukraine.\n\nThis footage was posted on a Telegram channel sympathetic to Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Wednesday, shortly after US and Saudi officials sounded alarms about an imminent Iranian attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran’s foreign ministry hit back, calling the reports baseless attempts by “Western and Zionist circles” aimed at “creating a negative atmosphere against the Islamic Republic.”\n\nBut just last month, IRGC chief Hossein Salami warned Saudi Arabia of “consequences” twice in one week for its alleged support for Israel and the nationwide protests that have gripped Iran. Tehran’s Yemeni proxy, the Houthi group, also threatened to strike Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a truce in Yemen expired in October. US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking traveled to the UAE and Saudi Arabia this week to try to “renew and expand” that truce, the State Department said Thursday.\n\nFor Iran, attacking Saudi Arabia – or even threatening to do so – is the closest it can come to hitting America without actually hitting America, and risking catastrophic consequences. This was demonstrated in 2019, when an audacious predawn attack on Saudi oil facilities that the United States blamed on Iran was met with a largely muffled response by the Trump White House, arguably the most pro-Saudi US administration ever. Tehran’s calculations likely take that into account. Iran denied involvement then, and the attack was claimed by the Houthis.\n\nIran is also proving to be a thorn in the US’s side by providing missiles and drones to foster Russia’s Ukraine invasion.\n\nIf Iran does indeed want to cause damage to both Saudi Arabia and the Biden administration, it likely considers the time to be ripe now, given the deep fissure in Saudi-American relations.\n\nBut its window to do so is probably small. When Aramco was hit in 2019, half of Saudi Arabia’s oil supply was knocked off the market, sending global crude prices soaring by 19.5%, the biggest jump on record. A similar scenario ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections would likely have a detrimental impact on the Democratic Party’s prospects in the vote as President Joe Biden struggles to battle inflation at home.\n\nThe bellicose battle of cartoons and Quranic verses between Saudi Arabia and Iran isn’t new. In late 2017, an animation surfaced on YouTube from a channel called Saudi Strike Force showing the kingdom’s forces invading Iran and capturing a quivering man, eerily similar to Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s Qods Force who was killed by the US in a January 2020 drone strike. In the footage, Iranians in Tehran are shown celebrating Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS) as their liberator.\n\nThat video started with a quote by MBS saying Saudi Arabia will “bring the fight to Iran” and it also ended with a Quranic verse – this one about a plea from Abraham to God: “O, my Lord! Make this city (Mecca) one of peace and security and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.”\n\nBut that was a different era. Now, the Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen and regionally has calmed, and Riyadh has actually been talking to Tehran, perhaps in an effort to prevent the heated rhetoric that culminated in the 2019 attack. The two countries held their sixth round of talks in April and both parties have cited progress.\n\nThe messages from Iran have been mixed. Last month, while the IRGC was threatening Riyadh, the Iranian Supreme Leader’s adviser called for Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen their embassies in each other’s capitals. “We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” said Ali Akbar Velayati.\n\nAn Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia would serve as a convenient distraction from public civil rights protests at home due to the damage it could cause to its regional nemesis and to the global economy. This time, however, given Iran’s very public threats to Saudi Arabia, Tehran may not have the option of plausible deniability as it did in 2019.\n\nBut the saber-rattling may also just be intended to keep the Saudis and Americans on their toes, the oil markets jittery, and prices high enough to hurt wallets and politics.\n\nIran protests\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi hit back at his US counterpart Biden for voicing his support for the protest movement in the country and promising to “free Iran.”\n\n“A few hours ago, I was informed that the President of America absentmindedly [said] ‘We will soon free Iran.’ We were freed 43-years-ago, and Iran will never be your milking cow,” Raisi said during a televised address on Friday.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign event in California Thursday ahead of the midterm elections, Biden seemed to imply his administration would support Iran’s nationwide uprising, telling the crowd, “don’t worry, we’re going to free Iran, they’re going to free themselves pretty soon.”\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nOver 14,000 people may have been arrested in Iran in the last six weeks, Javaid Rehman, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran told the UN Security Council on Wednesday.\n\nThe Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) said in a report that dozens of protesters are facing charges carrying the death penalty, adding that the demonstrators are being charged by the judiciary with “enmity against God” and “corruption on earth,” which is tantamount to a death sentence in Iran.\n\nA member of Iran’s volunteer paramilitary militia, the Basij, was killed during protests on the outskirts of Karaj, north central Iran on Thursday, according to the country’s official state news agency IRNA.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday announced that the US will work to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nThe digest\n\nPope Francis speaks out against death penalty in Bahrain\n\nThe pontiff spoke against the death penalty on Thursday at the start of a trip to Bahrain where the opposition has accused the government of overseeing human rights abuses and families of death row inmates had sought help from the pontiff, Reuters reported.\n\nBackground: The visit has thrust the pope into the Sunni-Shiite rights divide in Bahrain, which crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 2011. Referring to Bahrain’s constitution, the pope said commitments should constantly be put into practice so that “religious freedom will be complete,” equal dignity and equal opportunities “concretely recognized for each group,” and that no forms of discrimination exist nor human rights “violated.” “I think in the first place of the right to life, of the need to guarantee that right always, including for those being punished, whose lives should not be taken,” he added.\n\nWhy it matters: The pope’s visit has drawn attention to tensions between the government and the Shiite community that led sizeable pro-democracy protests in the 2011 “Arab Spring,” which Bahrain quashed with the help of its Gulf allies. King Hamad, in his speech, said his country protected the freedom of all faiths to “perform their rituals and establish their places of worship.” Families of death row inmates in Bahrain had appealed to the Argentine-born pope to speak out against capital punishment and defend political prisoners during his trip.\n\nChina-GCC Free Trade Agreement nears\n\nTalks for a free trade agreement (FTA) between China and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have entered their final stage, according to the UAE’s state news agency WAM, citing a Chinese diplomat.\n\nBackground: Zhang Yiming, Chinese ambassador to the UAE, said all sides of the FTA have agreed on most issues. He added that Beijing “has become the UAE’s largest non-oil trading partner in the world, and the UAE remained China’s second-largest trading partner and the largest export market in the Arab region.” Bilateral trade between the state and China exceeded $64 billion during the first eight months of 2022, he said, an almost 28% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nWhy it matters: China is one of the Gulf states’ most important trading partners. The Asian giant and its Gulf partners have strengthened ties in recent years, especially as US-Gulf relations have become increasingly strained.\n\nErdogan rival is first target of Turkish media law, opposition party says\n\nTurkey’s main opposition party has said its leader is the first target of a media “disinformation” law after police asked prosecutors to open an investigation into comments he made blaming authorities for a drug “epidemic,” Reuters reported. On Monday, Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said on Twitter that Ankara had not questioned the origin of money brought into the country and this “dirty money” from drug smuggling had been used to finance Turkey’s current account deficit. The police and interior ministry declined to comment.\n\nBackground: Last month parliament passed a law sought by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party that allows judges to impose jail sentences of up to three years on anyone who spreads false or misleading information.\n\nWhy it matters: Critics say what can be deemed false or misleading under the law is vaguely defined and open to abuse, and the legislation has raised deep concerns over free speech ahead of next year’s elections in Turkey, and questions over who might be prosecuted. Kilicdaroglu is seen by many as the most likely candidate to challenge Erdogan in a presidential election set for next June.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nCNN’s Hadas Gold speaks to Becky Anderson about Israel’s election, the country’s surge to the right and Netanyahu’s comeback.

Here's what we ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia has launched a series of “kamikaze” drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian government says Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities have suffered a barrage of drone attacks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired new drones from Iran over the summer.\n\nThe Ukrainians themselves have been using kamikaze drones to strike against Russian targets – and asked their allies to supply them with more of these deadly weapons.\n\nHere’s what we know about these drones.\n\nWhat are kamikaze drones?\n\nKamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a “loitering munition” because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe name “kamikaze” refers to the fact the drones are disposable. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, kamikaze drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles.\n\nParts of what Ukrainian authorities say is an Iranian Shahed-136 drone are seen in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nA Ukrainian police officer inspects a part of a shot-down drone in Kharkiv, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nWhich drones is Russia using in Ukraine?\n\nThe Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month.\n\nIn August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran.\n\nIran has denied supplying weapons to Russia despite evidence to the contrary. Iranian Foreign Minister Spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted by the state news agency IRNA on Monday as saying “Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party in the war between Russia and Ukraine and has not sent any weapons to either side.”\n\nBut Ukraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyiv’s military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of “Geran.”\n\nUS officials say there has been “some evidence already” that the Iranian drones “have already experienced numerous failures” on the battlefield.\n\nUS Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker told reporters late last month that “the idea that they represent some technological leap ahead, frankly we’re just not seeing borne out in the data.”\n\nMoscow also has its own kamikaze drones, made by the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern. Ukraine claimed on Wednesday it had shot down two of these ZALA Lancet drones that day.\n\nHow much damage can the drones cause?\n\nWhile relatively small, the Shahed drones are capable of carrying missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds). That means they can inflicted significant damage.\n\nRetired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told CNN the drones are “generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision.”\n\n“So the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated drones against large targets like cities. As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones,” he said.\n\nDrone attacks can have major impact on the civilian population. Zelensky accused Moscow of using them to spread terror among civilians.\n\n“All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,” he said Monday.\n\nAs air raid sirens rang through the capital city, many people spent hours hiding in basements, underground stations and bomb shelters, while schools returned to online education.\n\nIn a statement last week, the International Red Cross denounced the use of the drones, saying the use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes mental and psychological harm as well as life-threatening injuries.\n\nHow can Ukraine defend itself against these drones?\n\nUkraine has been asking its allies for air defense systems since the beginning of the war in February, but the need has become more urgent since Russia started using the Iranian-made drones.\n\nAir defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces.\n\n“Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, there’s a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,” Milley said.\n\n“The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, because each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights.”\n\nThe air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system – which stands for “Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target” – is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones.\n\nUkrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the “bulk” of the Shahed drones. Ukraine’s senior military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as “brothers in arms” for training an air defense battalion that he said had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheds. He said Poland had given Ukraine “systems” to help destroy the drones.\n\nLast month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling “advanced defensive technology” to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky made another plea for more air defense capacities on Thursday, saying Kyiv has only about 10% of what it needs to combat Moscow’s attacks.\n\nDoes Ukraine have kamikaze drones too?\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been using RAM II kamikaze drones, which were developed by a consortium of Ukrainian companies and bought with money crowdfunded by ordinary Ukrainians. These precision-guided loitering munitions can carry 3 kilogram (6.6 pound) warheads and have a flight range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), according to the manufacturers.\n\nBut Kyiv has also been relying on its allies for drone supplies. The US has sent several types of aerial weapon systems to Ukraine. These include Switchblade drones – small, portable kamikaze drones that can carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by American defense company AeroVironment.\n\nThe smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away (9.6 kilometers), according to specifications provided by the company, while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes.\n\nIn May, the US sent the Ukrainian military “phoenix ghost” drones, which are believed to be similar to Switchblade, although little is known about their capabilities.\n\nThe UK has also provided Ukraine with loitering munitions, including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones.\n\nUkraine has also been using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones. These have become something of a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. However, these are larger and designed to return home after dropping laser-guided bombs or missiles.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-drone-strikes-monday-intl/index.html", "title": "Russian drones attack Kyiv, as Moscow takes another swipe at ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nAt least two people were hurt and key infrastructure has been damaged in a Russian drone assault on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, the latest attempt by Moscow to ravage Ukraine’s power supplies.\n\nExplosions and air raid sirens were heard around the city early Monday, with alerts sounding from 2 a.m. until after 5 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have shot down 30 out of 35 drones launched from Sunday night into Monday, but those that got around air defenses damaged power systems and civilian targets.\n\nThe Iranian-made, self-detonating Shahed-136 and Shahed-131 drones were launched from the “eastern coast of the Sea of Azov,” the Air Force said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nMany of the drones targeted Kyiv, according to the city’s military administration, which said 18 out of 23 spotted in the sky over the capital were intercepted. There were no deaths recorded, but authorities said that one critical infrastructure facility was hit. Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration, said that emergency services were working to limit the consequences of the attack.\n\nPopko added that two areas in central and western Kyiv bore the brunt of the damage. A road in Solomyanskyi was damaged and fragments of a drone landed on a high rise residential building in Shevchenkivskui district.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have repeatedly hit Ukraine’s capital and other large cities around the country in recent weeks, seeking to wipe out the power grid and forcing millions of Ukrainians to go without electricity, heating and water during the freezing winter months.\n\nA Russian missile barrage on Friday dealt a major blow to Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, leaving millions without power. Repeated missile and drone attacks since October, which have targeted critical infrastructure, are part of a strategy by the Kremlin to terrorize Ukrainians and is in violation of the laws of war, according to experts.\n\nOn Friday, Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said “nine power generation facilities” were damaged, without specifying their locations.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his nightly address Sunday, said electricity had been restored to a total of nine million Ukrainians following that round of strikes, but large-scale outages remained in some areas.\n\n“I thank everyone who carries out these repair works in any weather and around the clock,” Zelensky said. “It is not easy, it is difficult, but I am sure: we will pull through together, and Russia’s aggression will fail.”\n\nThe repeated attacks come as Ukrainians far from the eastern and southern frontlines of the ground war seek for some semblance of normality in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nAn artificial Christmas tree in the center of Kyiv was installed and decorated over the weekend, set to be illuminated with “energy-saving garlands” that will be powered by a generator at specific times, the city’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.\n\nRoughly 1,000 blue and yellow balls and white doves will decorate the tree in Sophia Square, with a trident placed at the tree’s summit. Flags of countries that are supporting Ukraine will be placed at the bottom.\n\nThere will, however, be no Christmas markets, mass entertainment events or rides in Sophia Square, usually a focus of festive celebrations, this year.\n\nUkrainian children are asking St. Nicholas for air defense and weapons for “victory for all Ukrainians,” Zelensky said in his virtual address to the Joint Expeditionary Force leaders’ summit on Monday.\n\n“On St. Nicholas Day today … Russian terrorists gave a gift to Ukrainian children with new strikes,” said Zelensky.\n\n“Ukrainian children in their letters to St. Nicholas are asking for air defense, for weapons, for victory – a victory for them, a victory for all Ukrainians,” he said.\n\n“They understand everything, our children.

Three died in drone attacks on the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Kyiv would retaliate against Russia for its attacks. He asked allies to consider joint air defense operations and provide long-range capabilities after Russia pummelled Ukrainian energy infrastructure with more than 200 missiles and drones on Monday.\n\nDuring Tuesday's attack, Ukraine downed five out of 10 incoming missiles and 60 out of 81 drones, the air force said.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force lost track of 10 more drones that have likely come down somewhere on its territory, it said.

Emergency services were continuing to work at the sites, said Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.\n\n“Residents in Moscow awoke this morning to the sound of explosions,” said The Times. The Russian capital was “under siege” as the war “comes to Putin’s doorstep”, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nAccording to “a senior Russian politician”, three drones “were shot down over the city’s exclusive Rublyovka suburb, where President Putin has an official residence”, added The Times.\n\nThe paper added that “a Ukrainian presidential aide denied Russian claims that Kyiv was responsible, but predicted more such attacks”. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Major-General Kyrylo Budanov, had warned that there would be a swift response to a series of Russian missile strikes on Kyiv.\n\nMoscow, which is more than 620 miles from Ukraine, has “only rarely been targeted by drone attacks since the start of the conflict”, said The Guardian, even though such attacks have “become more common elsewhere in Russia”.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, two drones were shot down over the Kremlin in an attack blamed on Ukraine. There were reports of an explosion and smoke was seen rising from a Kremlin building. The Russian government described it as “an assassination attempt” against Vladimir Putin. If this were true, it would be a “highly embarrassing incident” for the Kremlin, said the BBC.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Joel Mathis", "Elliott Goat", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/russia-cyber-attacks-missiles-ukraine-blackouts/index.html", "title": "Russian missile strikes overshadow cyberattacks as Ukraine reels ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRussia has pummeled Ukrainian cities with missile and drone strikes for much of the past month, targeting civilians and large swaths of the country’s critical infrastructure.\n\nBy Monday, 40% of Kyiv residents were left without water, and widespread power outages were reported across the country. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of ‘energy terrorism’ and said that about 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply.\n\nThe destruction exemplifies how indiscriminate bombing remains the Kremlin’s preferred tactic eight months into its war on Ukraine. Moscow’s vaunted hacking capabilities, meanwhile, continue to play a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlin’s efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\n“Why burn your cyber capabilities, if you’re able to accomplish the same goals through kinetic attacks?” a senior US official told CNN.\n\nBut experts who spoke to CNN suggest there is likely more to the question of why Russia’s cyberattacks haven’t made a more visible impact on the battlefield.\n\nEffectively combining cyber and kinetic operations “requires a high degree of integrated planning and execution,” argued a US military official who focuses on cyber defense. “The Russians can’t even pull that sh*t off between their aviation, artillery and ground assault forces.”\n\nA lack of verifiable information about successful cyberattacks during the war complicates the picture.\n\nA Western official focused on cybersecurity said the Ukrainians are likely not publicly revealing the full extent of the impacts of Russian hacks on their infrastructure and their correlation with Russian missile strikes. That could deprive Russia of insights into the efficacy of their cyber operations, and in turn affect Russia’s war planning, the official said.\n\nTo be sure, a flurry of suspected Russian cyberattacks have hit various Ukrainian industries, and some of the hacks have correlated with Russia’s military objectives. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or transportation networks have largely been missing.\n\nNowhere was that more evident than the recent weeks of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. That’s a stark contrast to 2015 and 2016 when, following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, it was Russian military hackers, not bombs, that plunged more than a quarter million Ukrainians into darkness.\n\n“All the Ukrainian citizens are now living in these circumstances,” said Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian government cybersecurity official, referring to the blackouts and water shortages. “Imagine your ordinary day in the face of constant disruptions of power or water supply, mobile communication or everything combined.”\n\n‘Big, showy public response’\n\nCyber operations aimed at industrial plants can take many months to plan, and after the explosion in early October of a bridge linking Crimea to Russia, Putin was “trying to go for a big, showy public response to the attack on the bridge,” the senior US official said.\n\nBut officials tell CNN that Ukraine also deserves credit for its improved cyber defenses. In April, Kyiv claimed to thwart a hacking attempt on power substations by the same group of Russian military hackers that caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe war’s human toll has overshadowed those triumphs.\n\nUkrainian cybersecurity officials have for months had to avoid shelling while also doing their jobs: protecting government networks from Russia’s spy agencies and criminal hackers.\n\nFour officials from one of Ukraine’s main cyber and communications agencies — the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) — were killed October 10 in missile attacks, the agency said in a press release. The four officials did not have cybersecurity responsibilities, but their loss has weighed heavily on cybersecurity officials at the agency during another grim month of war.\n\nBetter prepared after years of attacks\n\nHackers linked with Russian spy and military agencies have for years targeted Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure with an array of hacking tools.\n\nAt least six different Kremlin-linked hacking groups conducted nearly 240 cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the buildup to and weeks after Russia’s February invasion, Microsoft said in April. That includes a hack, which the White House blamed on the Kremlin, that disrupted satellite internet communications in Ukraine on the eve of Russia’s invasion.\n\n“I don’t think Russia would measure the success in cyberspace by a single attack,” the Western official said, rather “by their cumulative effect” of trying to wear the Ukrainians down.\n\nMen cross the destroyed bridge with their bicycles in the frontline town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on October 11, 2022 Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut there are now open questions among some private analysts and US and Ukrainian officials about the extent to which Russian government hackers have already used up, or “burned,” some of their more sensitive access to Ukrainian critical infrastructure in previous attacks. Hackers often lose access to their original way into a computer network once they are discovered.\n\nIn 2017, as Russia’s hybrid war in eastern Ukraine continued, Russia’s military intelligence agency unleashed destructive malware known as NotPetya that wiped computer systems at companies across Ukraine before spreading around the world, according to the Justice Department and private investigators. The incident cost the global economy billions of dollars by disrupting shipping giant Maersk and other multinational firms.\n\nThat operation involved identifying widely used Ukrainian software, infiltrating it and injecting malicious code to weaponize it, said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, Cisco’s threat intelligence unit.\n\n“All of that was just as astonishingly effective as the end product was,” said Olney, who has had a team in Ukraine responding to cyber incidents for years. “And that takes time and it takes opportunities that sometimes you can’t just conjure.”\n\n“I’m pretty certain [the Russians] wish that they had what they burned during NotPetya,” Olney told CNN.\n\nZhora, the Ukrainian official who is a deputy chairman at SSSCIP, called for Western governments to tighten sanctions on Russia’s access to software tools that could feed its hacking arsenal.\n\n“We should not discard the probability that [Russian government hacking] groups are working right now on some high-complexity attacks that we will observe later on,” Zhora told CNN. “It is highly unlikely that all Russian military hackers and government-controlled groups are on vacation or out of business.”\n\nTanel Sepp, Estonia’s ambassador-at-large for cyber affairs, told CNN that it’s possible the Russians could turn to a “new wave” of stepped up cyberattacks as their battlefield struggles continue.\n\n“Our main goal is to isolate Russia on the international stage” as much as possible, Sepp said, adding that the former Soviet state has not communicated with Russia on cybersecurity issues in months.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/europe/ukraine-energy-russian-missiles-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Ukraine keeps patching up its power grid. But Russia's barrage ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhat Russia cannot win on the battlefield, it is seeking to win by casting Ukrainian cities into the dark and cold as a long winter sets in.\n\nThe result is a grinding battle of attrition: Barrages of Russian missiles fly across Ukraine, and Ukrainian power engineers work for days in freezing temperatures to restore power.\n\nMonday saw the largest wave of missile attacks since November 23. Ukraine’s state power generator, Ukrenergo, says that about 40% of normal electrical supply was offline at one point in October.\n\nIt’s become known as the electricity deficit, and it swings one way and another depending on missile impacts.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told CNN that “what the Ukrainian energy system has been experiencing since October, no energy system in the world has ever experienced.”\n\nThe CEO of state power generator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, says the issue is not in generating power but in getting it to the people.\n\n“The enemy is hitting the most important facilities and key elements of substations that ensure the output… and transmission of electricity.” Kudrytskyi told CNN.\n\nThe Russians go after the most vulnerable parts of the system. “By the nature of the attacks we see that Russian missiles are directed by Russian power engineers,” says Tymoshenko.\n\nThat’s in part because until this year Ukraine was in the same energy network as Russia and Belarus. Russian engineers knew the Ukrainian network inside out.\n\nThe main targets are high-voltage power lines, substations and distribution grids.\n\nWorkers dismantle an autotransformer on November 10 in central Ukraine. It was completely destroyed when the Ukrenergo high voltage power substation was hit by a missile strike on October 17. Ed Ram/Getty Images\n\nJoseph Majkut, director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that “Russia’s attacks have focused on key elements of Ukraine’s transmission network, preventing generated electricity from moving through the grid and to consumers… and forcing blackouts to balance the grid.\n\n“Attacks on high-voltage substations have been particularly damaging as they are critical for grid operation and difficult to repair.”\n\nUkraine is now scouring the world to find compatible parts and carry out repairs – as the morale of ordinary people is tested by power cuts that often last more than 12 hours a day. Prolonged blackouts threaten to send another wave of Ukrainian civilians fleeing westwards to Poland and other neighboring countries.\n\nThere is a glimpse of hope: Ukraine’s air defenses are getting better at taking out Russian cruise missiles, often with newly arrived Western equipment. Ukraine said it had taken out about 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday; video emerged of one being intercepted by a German-made Gepard anti-air missile.\n\nBut as few as a dozen Russian missiles hitting critical targets wreak havoc. 15 gigawatts of Ukraine’s power capacity have been taken out, compared to the pre-war capacity of 56 gigawatts (GW) of power, according to Ukrenergo.\n\nGradually power engineers are patching up the system – by this week the electricity deficit had been cut to 19 per cent. But the recovery is tenuous.\n\nSergey Kovalenko, CEO of power supplier YASNO, says that “Ukrainians will most likely have to live with blackouts until at least the end of March.”\n\nSome people in Kyiv have told CNN they are ready to retreat to rural dachas, where at least wood-burning stoves provide warmth.\n\nPeople walk down a street in downtown Kyiv on December 6, 2022. Russian attacks have left Ukraine's energy grid teetering on the brink of collapse, forcing repeated blackouts. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSpecialist equipment\n\nConscious of the impact on Ukrainian morale, Western governments have stepped up aid in the form of transformers, thousands of generators and other equipment.\n\nThe US has mobilized allies in the G7 group to focus on a multi-layered approach to keeping the lights, heat and water on. Washington has already provided more than $100 million for everything from circuit breakers to surge arresters and generators that are now reaching Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union is shipping emergency equipment, including welding electrodes and circuit breakers. The Ukraine Energy Support Fund has sent 37 shipments from 20 countries; 47 more deliveries are scheduled.\n\nKudrytskyi, the Ukrenergo CEO, reels off the list of countries that have sent equipment, Poland, Germany, Italy, Finland and Lithuania among them.\n\nBut Ukraine’s grid also requires specialist equipment that’s made to order, according to Joseph Majkut at CSIS. One example is the high voltage (750kV) system that moves electricity from nuclear plants to other parts of the grid.\n\n“There is not enough equipment available to enable full and lasting repairs to the power grid. For example, high voltage auto-transformers are hard to come by and have long lead times for fabrication from companies like Hitachi or Siemens,” Majkut told CNN. They also weigh up to 250 tonnes.\n\nMost of Europe runs at lower voltages, and many critical items would need to be manufactured specifically to meet Ukraine’s needs. Tymoshenko told CNN that some would take six to nine months to make, though he hoped that South Korea might be a promising source of compatible equipment.\n\nWorkers repair high-voltage power lines cut by recent missile strikes near Odesa on December 7, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Oleksander Gimanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeantime, Ukrainian engineers are carrying out patchwork repairs, according to Kudrytskyi, installing “used equipment that often does not meet the full technical specifications of the grid but can be temporarily implemented by grid engineers.”\n\nBut he warned the company is running out of equipment.\n\n“Although Ukrenergo had a significant stock of other equipment for emergency restoration works, it is being exhausted due to the scale of damage.”\n\nThere are some short-term options. As of the beginning of December, USAID had provided 2,200 generators to communities across the country. Hundreds more have been imported from Europe – and mobile boiler houses could provide heating for 7 million civilians later this winter, the US State Department says.\n\nGenerators help keep critical services running: hospitals, sewage plants, housing for the vulnerable. But Kudrytskyi says they are “a temporary alternative. They cannot replace power generation at any type of power plant.”\n\nThey also require a lot of fuel, of which there has been a shortage at times during the conflict.\n\nIn the longer-term, Ukraine looks to its integration into the European grid. Tymoshenko told CNN that Ukraine’s power system has been part of the continental network since March after synchronization of the systems. This enables an easier trade in electricity.\n\n“And this, of course, will encourage us to further technological development of the power system after victory,” he says.\n\nThat synchronization is already paying dividends. To stabilize the grid in Ukraine, some electricity destined for Kyiv or Odesa passes through Europe and back into Ukraine.\n\nDefending the skies\n\nThe other half of the equation is better anti-missile defenses. With their S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems and more recently Germany’s highly capable IRIS-T and the US NASAMS, Ukraine’s air defenses have intercepted a growing proportion of Russian cruise missiles and Iranian attack drones.\n\nIn October, Ukrainian air defenses were taking out just over half of the cruise missiles being fired, according to the Ukrainian military’s figures. That proportion is now above two-thirds - and the Ukrainians believe the Russians are running out of their more accurate systems.\n\nAmid the blackouts, lighting on the streets is minimal, with the majority coming from public transport and car headlights in the western city of Lviv on November 16, 2022.

The Ukrainians want more – and ask Germany and the US almost every day for Patriot missile batteries.

Now Ukrainian grain ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia has moved rapidly to cripple the United Nations-brokered Black Sea grain corridor in the wake of the drone attack early Saturday on the Crimean port of Sevastopol.\n\nUkraine has not confirmed that its forces attacked the port, and the extent of the damage to Russian naval vessels is not yet clear.\n\nBut it is very much in the Ukrainians’ interest to damage Russia’s Black Sea fleet and its home port. Ships and submarines routinely set out from Sevastopol with sea-launched cruise missiles to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and especially its power grid. Those attacks resumed Monday, though at least some were air-launched.\n\nSome reports from unofficial Ukrainian and Russian sources said the Admiral Makarov, a Russian frigate and one of several surface ships that carry Kalibr cruise missiles, had sustained significant damage Saturday, but there has been no independent confirmation of the claim.\n\nThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that “social media footage documented an unknown number of unmanned surface vehicles striking at least one Grigorovich-class frigate.”\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said there had been only minor damage to a minesweeper. But the fact that the maritime drones reached the port at all angered some Russian military bloggers, who asked why netting at the entrance to the port had not been closed.\n\nThe ISW noted that a Ukrainian decision to target a “Kalibr-capable frigate at this time makes sense given the intensified Russian drone and missile strike campaign targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”\n\nRussia’s suspension of the Black Sea “grain corridor” – which allowed vital shipments of grain and oilseeds to pass safely through the Black Sea to reach global markets – was predictable and inevitable after a growing drumbeat from Moscow that July’s agreement had not produced the promised benefits for Russian exports of grain and fertilizer.\n\nBut, in an effort to shift blame, the Defense Ministry in Moscow explicitly linked the suspension to the Sevastopol attack, claiming that the drones that attacked the Black Sea Fleet were launched from Odesa and had moved through the corridor. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow added that these actions “were directed… against Russian ships that ensured the functioning of the said humanitarian corridor.”\n\nOn Sunday, the Defense Ministry claimed – without providing supporting evidence – that the memory of a navigation receiver that had been recovered showed that “the launch of marine unmanned vehicles was carried out from the coast near the city of Odesa.”\n\nRussian warships are seen ahead of the Navy Day parade in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Crimea, on July 23, 2021. Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters\n\nClaims over sea drones\n\nLittle is known about Ukraine’s maritime drones. A purported image of one circulated on social media in August, showing what looked like a small speedboat washed up on the Crimean shore. That image was never confirmed as genuine. But this weekend, one Russian military commentator alleged on Telegram that it bore all the hallmarks of an American-made marine drone.\n\nAlexey Rogozin, of the Center for Transportation Technology, said that a “large internal space in the device found near Sevastopol makes it possible to place a large warhead, activated by a contact fuse.”\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry also alleged that one of the drones could have been launched from a civilian ship carrying agricultural products from the three ports of Ukraine that were part of the agreement.\n\nIt said specialists had conducted an examination of a Canadian-made navigation module installed on one recovered drone, yet again tying NATO directly to Ukraine’s war effort.\n\nAltogether, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry, the attack involved “nine unmanned aerial vehicles and seven autonomous sea drones.” It also accused the United Kingdom of training the Ukrainian military on the sea drones, a claim swiftly rejected by the UK’s Defense Ministry, which tweeted that “to detract from their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Defense is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale.”\n\n(For good measure, Moscow also claimed that Britain’s navy had been responsible for the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic last month.)\n\nThe Turkish-flagged ship Polarnet, carrying grain from Ukraine, arrives at Derince Port, Kocaeli, Turkey, on August 8, 2022. Sahin Oktay/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nUkraine has dismissed the Russians’ linkage of the attack with the grain corridor. The Secretary of the National Security Council, Oleksii Danilov, described the Russian narrative as “paranoid and delusional.”\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday that Russia had suspended its participation in the grain deal “on a false pretext of explosions 220 kilometers away from the grain corridor,” and said Russia had planned its withdrawal from the accord “well in advance.”\n\n“Russia took the decision to resume its hunger games long ago and now tries to justify it,” Kuleba tweeted.\n\nIn September, according to documents seen by CNN, Russian officials involved in the clearing of ships in Istanbul, Turkey, began delaying inspections, causing a large backlog in traffic.\n\nThe grain corridor has allowed ships to carry some nine million tonnes of grain from Ukrainian ports to foreign markets over the past three months, according to Ukraine’s Infrastructure Ministry.\n\nThe ministry said on Sunday that 101 vessels were waiting for inspection before entering Ukrainian ports and that 22 loaded vessels were waiting to leave Ukrainian ports.\n\nRepresentatives of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations inspect the ship Razoni, which left Odesa loaded with corn and anchored by the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul, Turkey, on August 3, 2022. Turkish Defense Ministry/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nGrain deal ‘much more risky’ without Russia\n\nNow Russia has suspended its participation in the deal, it will be much more difficult for Ukraine to export its grain and oilseeds – if the other three parties to the accord (Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations) give in to Russian threats.\n\nLate Sunday, in a somewhat surprising decision, the Joint Coordinating Center (JCC) in Istanbul announced that it had approved the passage of 16 ships Monday to and from Ukrainian ports. It added: “The UN delegation, in its capacity as JCC Secretariat, has informed the delegation of the Russian Federation on the movement.”\n\nThat was despite the Russian Foreign Ministry saying Sunday that it was “suspending [the agreement’s] implementation as of today for an indefinite period.”\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres postponed travel plans to focus on saving the arrangement, in which he invested substantial effort in the first half of this year.\n\nIt’s unclear whether and for how long the Black Sea corridors will continue to operate without Russian assent. The willingness of merchant shipping to carry grain through contested waters without the safeguard of the deal (and of insurers to provide the insurance required) is yet to be tested.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned Monday, in a regular call with reporters, that without Russia’s participation, the Black Sea grain deal would become “much more risky, dangerous and unguaranteed.”\n\nWithout Russia guaranteeing navigation safety in these areas, “such a deal is hardly feasible,” he added.\n\nAny prolonged interruption may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for grain. Amid drought in parts of east Africa, the International Rescue Committee said “the renewed blockade will continue to impede the import of 80% of grain imported from the Russia-Ukraine region, thereby driving further hunger.”\n\nBut it’s crystal clear that Ukraine will continue efforts to counter Russian missile attacks on its infrastructure. It won’t risk attacking airbases inside Russia and in Belarus, but it won’t hesitate to continue striking Russia’s Black Sea fleet.", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/iran-missiles-russia/index.html", "title": "Iran is preparing to send additional weapons including ballistic ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nIran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, officials from a western country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program told CNN.\n\nThe shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield.\n\nThe last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones.\n\nThis new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia’s war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones are known as a “loitering munition” because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets.\n\nSending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is not going to “waste our time” on talks to revive the nuclear deal “if nothing’s going to happen.” Tehran’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on nationwide protests prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September have prompted the US to impose further sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehran’s direct engagement in the conflict.\n\n“We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,” Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nMalley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday.\n\n“We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that it’s happening,” Malley said.\n\nOn Monday a senior US defense official said they didn’t have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has “concerns” that Russia may “seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,” Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n“We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,” Ryder said.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has “no effective defense against these (surface-to-surface) missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have.”\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it “has not and will not” do so.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report Iran’s plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia.\n\nThe US is “looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions” in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is “trying to break up these networks.”\n\nBut it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia.\n\nUS officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered.\n\nLast month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to “target producers and procurers” contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Department’s Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said.\n\nThe question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry – including more advanced missiles – to Russia.", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/europe/russian-missile-strikes-ukraine-intl/index.html", "title": "Kyiv and other Ukraine cities hit by barrage of Russian missile strikes", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia launched a barrage of missile strikes at Ukrainian cities on Monday as it ramped up its attacks on infrastructure facilities across the country.\n\nExplosions and air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv early on Monday and 80% of residents were left without water – with many losing electricity, too – following power outages caused by Russian strikes, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram.\n\nOne of the strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350,000 apartments in the capital, Klitschko said, adding that emergency services were attempting to restore power and “stabilize the situation as soon as possible.”\n\nAttacks on critical infrastructure in the central regions of Cherkasy and Kirovohrad, the eastern region of Kharkiv, and the southern region of Zaphorizhzhia were also reported.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that the onslaught was “partly” a response to an attack on Russia’s fleet in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Saturday, which he blamed on Kyiv. Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014 and has controlled the territory since then.\n\nPutin also warned that the strikes are “not all we could do.”\n\nShot down by Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it had eliminated about 90% of the Russian missiles used in the attacks.\n\n“The enemy attacked military and civilian infrastructure facilities with 55 aircraft guided missiles, 45 of which were shot down by our defenders,” the military’s General Staff said.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, power was still partially out for many – though it had been restored to some.\n\n“Power engineers plan to stabilize the situation with the electricity supply at about 9-10 pm.” Klitschko said on Telegram, adding: “But even after the resumption of electricity supply, power cuts will still be applied. Because the situation is difficult.”\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that diplomats “are in constant contact with their partners” to try to get assistance and equipment to repair the extensive damage.\n\nKyiv is in touch with the European Union and NATO as well as several governments. It had already concluded agreements in 12 countries to obtain nearly 1,000 units of power equipment, including generators, according to Kuleba.\n\n“We continue to work on increasing the number of partners and the volume of support,” he added.\n\nThe Russian missile strikes brought fresh hardship for Kyiv residents who were cut off from water supplies, among them Viktor Halashan. Denys Otroshchenko/CNN\n\nEarlier, Klitschko urged residents of the capital to stock up on water from shops and pumping stations after an attack on a nearby power facility.\n\n“Currently, due to damage to the energy facility near Kyiv, 80% of the capital’s consumers remain without water supply,” he said on Telegram. “Just in case, we ask you to stock up on water from the nearest pumps and points of sale. Specialists are doing everything possible to return water to the apartments of Kyiv residents.”\n\nPeople line up to fill up with water in Kyiv.

I have a 4-year-old child, so of course I feel stressed.\n\n“We don’t have water right now, but we do have electricity. We hope that the services will restore everything very quickly. Our spirit is very high, and we are waiting for victory. Such terrorist actions targeting water and electricity supply, I believe, do not scare people anymore.”\n\nViktor Halashan, aged 70, told CNN he is remaining positive despite having no water supply.\n\n“Not having water is fine, we can handle this,” he said, adding that he hopes Ukraine’s “troops will get us closer to victory soon.”\n\nLocal office worker Oleksandr Nechepuriak told CNN he was collecting water for 15 people.\n\n“It’s important to get (the)office running,” said Nechepuriak, who works in food production.\n\n“We will handle this,” he said, adding that there are “no other options.”\n\nHomes in Kharkiv also without water\n\nUkraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, described the attacks as “barbaric,” saying on Facebook: “Electric substations, hydropower and heat generation facilities were hit by rocket fire.”\n\nHe added: “As a result of this massive attack, there was a partial blackout and emergency power outage schedules were introduced for consumers in Kyiv, Cherkasy (and) Zaporizhzhia, and Cherkasy, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, (and) Poltava regions.”\n\nThe water supply in Kharkiv – Ukraine’s second-largest city – was also affected after an infrastructure facility was hit, while most subway train services were halted, mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.\n\n“The blow fell on a critical infrastructure facility, resulting in the subway and ground electric transport being de-energized,” he said. “At the moment, we have managed to launch the Kholodnohirsko-Zavodska (subway) line, and we have replaced trolleybuses and trams with buses.”\n\nTerekhov said engineers were “doing everything possible to resume water supply to the homes of Kharkiv residents as soon as possible.”\n\nTwo missiles hit Kharkiv on Monday morning, the mayor had previously said on Telegram.\n\nAnd in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, one missile hit an industrial enterprise, mayor Oleksandr Vilkul said on Telegram.\n\n“During the morning missile attack, two missiles were shot down (thanks to the Air Defense Forces), and one cruise missile hit an industrial enterprise,” he said. There were no casualties reported.\n\nMonday’s strikes hit 10 regions and damaged 18 facilities, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Telegram.\n\n“Their target was not military facilities, but civilian critical infrastructure,” Shmyhal said. “Missiles and drones hit 10 regions, where 18 facilities were damaged, most of them energy-related.”\n\nHe said “hundreds of settlements in seven regions” had lost power and engineers were “working at full capacity” to repair the damage.\n\nUkraine’s air force said Russia had launched more than 50 cruise missiles into Ukraine on Monday, and said it had intercepted 44 of them.\n\n“At 7:00 a.m. on October 31, the Russian occupiers launched several waves of missile attacks on critical infrastructure facilities in Ukraine,” the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said.\n\n“More than 50 X-101/X-555 cruise missiles were launched from the Tu-95/Tu-160 strategic aviation missile-carrying aircraft north of the Caspian Sea and the Volgodonsk region (Rostov region). 44 cruise missiles were destroyed” by the Ukrainian military, the air force statement added.\n\nAt least 10 Russian missiles were shot down over Kyiv early on Monday, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said on Telegram.\n\n“The police of the Kyiv region are now discovering debris from downed rockets of the occupiers in various areas of the region,” he said. “Air defense forces shot down at least 10 enemy missiles.”\n\nOleksii Kuleba, head of Kyiv region military administration, said the strikes “hit critical infrastructure targets” and two people had been injured, one seriously.\n\nMonday’s missiles were launched from Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers that took off from Russia’s Rostov region and over the Caspian Sea, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force Command said on television.\n\nYurii Ihnat said there had been “several waves of missile launches” and repeated the claim that Ukraine had shot down “a really high percentage.”\n\nIhnat also appealed for more US and German air defenses in the wake of the attacks.\n\n“We need air defense. Those systems that we have already mentioned, the (German-made) IRIS-T, we need more of them,” he said.\n\nSo far Germany has supplied Ukraine with one IRIS-T.\n\n“This system works and it worked today, and worked with a 100% result,” Ihnat said. “And we want the Germans to increase production.”\n\nHe also mentioned the US-made NASAMS system, which is due to be delivered, and older systems such as the US-made HAWK ground-to-air missile.\n\nMoscow defended the attacks. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Telegram Monday that it had targeted Ukraine’s “military command and energy systems.”\n\n“The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued strikes with high-precision, long-range air and sea-based weapons against Ukraine’s military command and energy systems,” it said. “All assigned objects have been hit.”\n\nKremlin says can’t guarantee navigation safety after pulling out of grain deal\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia has launched a barrage of attacks on Ukraine’s power and heating infrastructure.\n\nEven before Monday’s strikes, the situation was grave. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that about four million Ukrainians had power restrictions after attacks on energy infrastructure that day.\n\nDmytro Sakharuk, executive director of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, said it’s not possible to say how long outages will last following the latest strikes, while the necessary equipment to make repairs is also running low.\n\nSakharuk told Ukrainian television: “Unfortunately, we have already used up the stock of equipment that we had in our warehouses after the first two waves of attacks that have been taking place since October 10. We were able to purchase some equipment. But unfortunately, the cost of the equipment is now measured in hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\n“We are working on the ways to purchase it or get it from our partners. This is a problem for all power engineers. Cumulative losses as of yesterday are hundreds of millions of dollars for our company,” he added.\n\nThe assault on infrastructure is all part of a bigger plan by President Vladimir Putin, Melinda Haring, deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, told CNN last week.\n\nUkrainians shelter inside a metro station after a missile attack in Kyiv on Monday. Andrii Nesterneko/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n“Putin’s game plan is obvious: he wants to make this winter the coldest and darkest in Ukraine’s history,” she said.\n\n“He will continue to strike infrastructure grids so as to knock out Ukraine’s power and heat. His kamikaze drone attacks are meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people and to spark panic.”\n\nSome experts question how successful this strategy will be.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: “That Ukrainian air defences are successfully engaging some of the Russian cruise missiles being launched appears clear, what is less so are the claims regarding the exact numbers being intercepted, and the numbers getting through to the target.\n\n“Conversely the number of air-launched cruise missiles that Russia still holds in its inventory has been reduced greatly, raising the question of how long it could continue to sustain such attacks.”\n\nMonday’s attacks come after Russia suspended its participation in a United Nations-brokered grain deal viewed as key to addressing the global food shortage. Moscow announced it was leaving the deal on Saturday, blaming Ukraine for a drone attack on Crimea. Kyiv accused Russia of inventing “fictitious terrorist attacks” and using the deal as “blackmail.”\n\nIn a regular call with reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Black Sea grain deal is “risky” and “dangerous” if Russia cannot guarantee navigation safety.\n\nAsked if it is possible for the grain deal to continue without Russia’s participation, Peskov said that without Russia guaranteeing navigation safety in these areas, “such a deal is hardly feasible.”", "authors": ["Kostan Nechyporenko Olga Voitovych Victoria Butenko Lianne Kolirin", "Kostan Nechyporenko", "Olga Voitovych", "Victoria Butenko", "Lianne Kolirin"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/06/01/ukraine-war-kharkiv-map/73881525007/", "title": "Ukraine's Kharkiv region endures intensified attacks: See maps", "text": "Russian battlefield gains in Ukraine have prompted a new approach from the Biden administration on where and how Ukraine can use U.S.-supplied weapons on targets within Russia.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use certain U.S. weapons on military bases and infrastructure inside Russia's border. This decision is in response to recent Russian advances, including the seizure of nearly 100 square miles of land near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nKharkiv has come under intensified attacks over the past month as Russia opened a new front in its offensive operations. Until now, the U.S. had imposed limits on the use of weapons systems it supplies, forbidding Ukrainians to hit targets inside Russia, allowing Russian to continue striking the city from within the relative safety of its own territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nPolicy shift:Biden OKs Ukraine's use of US weapons inside Russia in major shift\n\nWhere has Russia advanced in Ukraine?\n\nOn May 10, Russia launched a major ground assault across the border, capturing several villages in Ukraine's northeastern region of Kharkiv. Russia seized about 99 square miles of Ukrainian between May 9 and May 15 — its biggest gains in 18 months — according to Agence France Presse estimates based on data from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nAbout 20,000 people were evacuated from Kharkiv and nearby Sumy as of Tuesday, according to Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's deputy prime minister. The aim of the offensive was probably to stretch an already critical Ukrainian defensive line and possibly bring Kharkiv, home to some 1.5 million people, into the range of heavy artillery, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).\n\nKharkiv has been the target of frequent missile attacks for two years, but a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September 2022 pushed the invading forces out of most of the region. This included Vovchansk, which had a pre-war population of 17,000 — the city is three miles from the Russian border and has been a hotspot for fighting.\n\nRussia has also launched a separate assault in the direction of Lyptsi village, so its forces could position artillery within range of Kharkiv which lies 20 minutes down the road.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defense says Ukrainian forces have slowed down the pace of Russian offensive and repelled the attacks. ISW reports that Ukraine has managed to regain several positions, but Russia may launch another assault on the area.\n\n45 civilians have been killed and 189 injured in Kharkiv region and city since Russia began the offensive, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nOn May 16, the residents of Kharkiv region experienced the longest air raid alert since the start of the full-scale invasion. Telegram posts indicate that It lasted over 16 and a half hours during which several drone attacks were reported.\n\nAt least 18 people were killed and 48 were wounded after Russian forces hit a Kharkiv home improvement store May 25 with two glide bombs, according to Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region. It was the deadliest attack in several weeks.\n\nRussia's use of glide bombs a factor\n\nRussian forces have been pummeling Kharkiv with missile strikes, drones and glide bombs. These cheap but destructive bombs are built by adding fold-out wings and satellite navigation to old Soviet bombs. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 3,200 glide bombs were dropped on Ukraine this month.\n\nUkraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, according to Zelenskyy. With a range of 99 miles, Patriot missile defense systems could deter or take down the incoming Russian planes dropping glide bombs.\n\nThe United States will provide a new $275 million military aid package for Ukraine to help the country repel Russia’s assault on Kharkiv, according to a statement from the US Department of Defense released on Friday. It includes ammunition for HIMARS, 155 mm and 105 mm artillery rounds, missiles and precision aerial munitions.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, Shawn J.

A statement from Defense Secretary Mark Esper says Air Force Maj. Gen. James B. Hecker is being promoted and will oversee the military school, which is located at Maxwell Air Force Base. Hecker is serving on the Pentagon staff in Washington. Hecker is a pilot who graduated from the Air Force Academy about 30 years ago. Air University is the nation’s main site for the professional education of Air Force officers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Department of Health and Social Services reports a person experienced PSP symptoms after eating a clam harvested near Perryville on the Alaska Peninsula, the first reported illness this year. The symptoms can include tingling of the lips and tongue within minutes of eating a toxic shellfish. Symptoms can progress to tingling of fingers and toes and the loss of muscle control in the arms and legs followed by difficulty breathing. The department says some people experience a sense of floating or nausea. If chest and abdomen muscles become paralyzed, death can occur within hours. In the past month, high PSP toxin levels have been detected in shellfish collected from Chignik Lagoon, Chignik Bay, King Cove and Sand Point.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Environmental regulators have issued a high pollution advisory for ozone for the Phoenix metropolitan area. Arizona Department of Environmental Quality officials recommended that people limit outdoor activity Thursday while the advisory is in effect, especially children and adults with respiratory problems. People most vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution include children, older adults, adults exercising outdoors and people with heart or lung disease and those suffering from asthma and bronchitis. Exposure can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis or other lung disease and reduce the body’s ability to fight infection.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: City leaders are planning to draft an ordinance next month addressing a problematic rooster that has been attacking pedestrians. Mayor Jan Larson says the “vicious” rooster scratches and chases people. She says a woman fell while fleeing the rooster, which also went after a small boy. Police Chief Michael Henderson says no one has been injured by the rooster, but his department has received complaints. Larson notes that chickens and roosters are permitted in Jasper. Sara Orlowski, a poultry specialist with the University of Arkansas, says some roosters can be aggressive when protecting their flock of hens. Their mating season is spring and summer. She tells the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that running away from roosters sends them the message that they’re dominant, encouraging them to pursue.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom says he is encouraged by Chevron’s efforts to clean up what has turned into the state’s largest oil spill in decades. The governor visited the oilfield west of Bakersfield on Wednesday, where more than 900,000 gallons have seeped out of the ground over the last couple of months, according to KQED News. About one-third of that is oil and the other two-thirds water. Chevron says the oil spill might have started when crews tried to seal an abandoned well. State officials say the spill does not pose a risk to drinking water. Newsom told reporters Chevron has been forthright about the incident. But he adds that the state will ask the company to turn over data so regulators can investigate the cause of the leak.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Metropolitan State University of Denver is conducting environmental testing at a campus building where four university employees have been diagnosed with three types of cancer. The building is located at the Auraria Campus. According to a letter sent to staff Thursday by Auraria Higher Education Center CEO Colleen Walker and Metropolitan State University of Denver COO Larry Sampler, all four employees worked in the same immediate office area of the West Classroom. Results of the independent testing of the work area are expected Aug. 8. The letter noted that previous environmental testing in West Classroom for lead in the water and asbestos indicated no reason to doubt that the building is safe to occupy.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new analysis shows Connecticut outpaces other states and the federal government when it comes to employing women in the highest levels of state government. Although the report released Wednesday by the Governor’s Council on Women and Girls found women hold nearly 52% of executive branch jobs considered “officials and administrators,” it also says the state has more work to do addressing “representation problems.” The analysis also shows minority men and women earn less than white men and women in executive branch agencies. The average minority male earns approximately $10,000 less than the average white male and female, and the average minority female earns almost $8,000 less than the average white female. Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz says all state agencies and branches of government should conduct their own reviews.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The state’s next medical marijuana dispensary will open next to retail stores on Concord Pike across from Brandywine Town Center. The dispensary, the state’s fifth, will sit between Mattress Warehouse and Sprint in the new shopping center, which also features Metro Diner and Helzberg Diamonds, and will soon add a home theater store. It will be the second state location for Columbia Care, a New-York based medical cannabis company. Columbia Care declined to comment, other than to say that it is too early in the process to provide further details. More than 5,000 people in the state are certified by their doctors to purchase medical marijuana, according to the state health department. Medical marijuana can be used to treat a host of conditions, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and other ailments that cause chronic pain.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some subcontractors for a homeless shelter say they’re struggling to get paid despite finishing work nearly a year ago. The Washington Post reports the Kennedy was the first of seven shelters set to replace a troubled megashelter that was demolished last year. The District awarded the $14 million project without competitive bidding to developer 5th Street Partners, which then hired Moseley Construction to oversee construction and subcontractors. The general contractor’s CEO, Johnny D. Moseley, says payment delays are the result of the city not fully paying the developer, something the city denies. The city’s final $1.6 million payment was made this month.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: Wildlife officials are patrolling state waters during an annual two-day spiny lobster sport season to make sure divers are following the rules. The season began Wednesday after midnight and ran through Thursday. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers were stopping boaters off Miami Beach on Wednesday. Some boaters even approached the wildlife officers’ boat to save time. A saltwater fishing license and a lobster stamp are required to take the crustaceans. The lobster’s carapace must be larger than 3 inches, located from between the horns to where the head meets the tail. Egg-bearing female lobsters must also be left alone. A dive flag is mandatory for safety. Participants in Monroe County and Biscayne National Park can only have six lobsters. The limit is 12 for the rest of the state. The regular season starts Aug. 6 and ends March 31.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAmericus: Authorities say two people are dead after a small plane crashed in a pecan orchard. Col. Eric Bryant of the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office told reporters the crash Wednesday morning scattered debris over an area the size of a football field. He said officials are working to identify the two people aboard the plane who died. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen says the plane crashed right after it took off from nearby Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in Americus. That’s about 140 miles south of Atlanta. Bergen said the plane was a single-engine Cirrus SR22 aircraft. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are sending crash investigators to the scene.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: A Kauai beach park has reopened following a $6 million repair project. Black Pot Beach Park in northern Kauai welcomed visitors Monday for the first time in more than a year, the Garden Island reported Wednesday. An overflowing river in Hanalei Bay washed vehicles into the water and destroyed restrooms and roads in April 2018. City officials have been working on repairs since, the newspaper reported. The repair project included a new roundabout, parking lot, drop-off and pickup zones and landscaping changes to enhance the ocean view, park officials said. There are also temporary portable restrooms located at the park, which will be replaced with new units, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCorrection & clarification: The Idaho National Laboratory, a nuclear research facility, is in the southeastern part of the state. The location was incorrect in the 50 States feature on July 26.\n\nBoise: Employees returned to work Thursday at a sprawling nuclear research site in southeastern Idaho after a wildfire forced two days of evacuations. The lightning-caused wildfire at the Idaho National Laboratory is one of several burning across the U.S. West. The nuclear research complex sits on a parcel of desert that is nearly the size of Rhode Island, and facilities there include nuclear reactors, high-level nuclear waste treatment plants and various nuclear research projects. The wildfire, which started Monday night and has burned an estimated 177 square miles, threatened some of those buildings for a time. But a shift in wind direction on Wednesday moved the fire toward open range land and helped fire crews make progress in fighting the flames. The lab has several safety measures for wildfires, including clearing the ground around each building and having several specially trained fire crews.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The city is receiving more than $2.3 million in federal grants to upgrade its fleet of buses to make them more environmentally friendly. Illinois members of Congress announced Wednesday that the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District will use the money to purchase zero- and lower-emissions buses. The general manager of the Peoria-area transportation system, Doug Roelfs, says electric buses bought with the money will help modernize the city’s aging fleet and help achieve the goal of making the entire agency more “environmentally conscious.” The funds come from an emissions program under the Federal Transit Administration. The grants enable state and local authorities to buy more environmentally sound buses, as well as to acquire, lease or build support facilities.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A proposed 9,200-head hog farm is moving forward despite opposition from residents who say it will hurt property values and environmentalists worried about its proximity to a large reservoir. Farm Service Agency loan specialist Michael Priest says the project’s two barns have received the required permits from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. Each will house up to 4,620 wean-to-finish pigs. Boss Hog Barns and Snowhill Ridge plan to build the farm in Miami County about 4 miles from the Mississinewa Reservoir and the Miami State Recreation Area. Environmentalists worry farm runoff could impact both sites. The Kokomo Tribune reports some residents fear the smell of hogs and manure will harm property values and the farm will impact their health and compromise crucial water resources.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Japanese beetles and thistle caterpillars have been abundant and wreaking havoc throughout the month. Japanese beetles generally break out for six to eight weeks in early June, but because of the cool weather at that time, the adult beetles arrived in en mass around the beginning of July. These beetles can cause a grade deal of damage to linden and crabapple trees, fruit-bearing trees and grapevines, along with other foliate flora. The thistle caterpillars have been hatching in unusual droves across Iowa soybean fields. Thistle caterpillars are not considered a pest species and, according to Robin Pruisner, Iowa’s head entomologist, haven’t posed a serious threat to crops at any time in her memory. The high number of thistle caterpillars noticed this year could be problematic for soybean plants, though no one is sounding the alarm quite yet.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Two months after Perry Lake flooded, the Kansas National Guard continues to deliver water to residents in a nearby village – and the effort could continue until mid-September. The Guard has delivered 1.3 million gallons of water to Lakeside Village because the community’s water well pumps are submerged after flooding in May at Perry Lake, about 1 mile from the village. Jane Welch, spokeswoman for the Adjutant General, says six guardsmen, using three trucks, are hauling 40,000 gallons of water every day to about 150 homes. The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday that Perry Lake Heavy reached 921.14 feet, its highest level in 26 years. The Lawrence Journal-World reports the Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying for the water hauling because Jefferson County is part of a federal disaster declaration.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: The Kentucky National Guard says more than 150 soldiers are deploying to the Middle East. Soldiers with the 206th Engineer Battalion are headed to the U.S. Central Command Area of Operations to conduct construction missions in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. The last deployment for the unit was in 2006 when it was sent to Kuwait during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Sowela Technical Community College says a $1 million donation from an energy company will be used to give its students hands-on experience in oil and gas work at a new “pipeline academy.” The school announced the donation from TC Energy in a Tuesday news release. The academy at Sowela’s Lake Charles campus will include a pipeline training area at the college’s Process Technology Center. The college says the center will function as a working plant, where students will be required to complete shift work as part of their curriculum.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The Bangor State Fair started Thursday and runs through Aug. 3. The event takes place near Cross Insurance Center and usually draws more than 40,000 visitors. Organizers say it dates to 1849. The event is billed as an agricultural and recreational fair. The schedule includes fireworks and tractor pulls, as well as traditional fair staples such as sheep and rabbit shows. The fair also includes a full schedule of live music, food and games.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A professor who was removed by the U.S. Naval Academy after an investigation into his conduct in class was reinstated to his job by a federal board. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board ordered the reinstatement of Bruce Fleming with back pay within 20 days. The English professor was removed in August. Administrative Judge Mark Syska wrote in the order that the primary witness in the case “had severe credulity issues.” He also wrote that the purported victims in the case, who were students, “did not generally take offense or have any actual issue with the appellant.” Jason Ehrenberg, Fleming’s attorney, said academy officials were trying to punish his client for criticizing the academy. Cmdr. Alana Garas, an academy spokeswoman, said the Navy was reviewing the decision. Fleming had been a civilian English professor at the academy since 1987.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWest Springfield: Police are warning hikers to be on the lookout for aggressive yaks. West Springfield police say a hiker in the Bear Hole Reservoir recreation area was charged by three yaks at about 8 p.m. Wednesday. The West Springfield Environmental Committee posted on Facebook that they appeared docile so someone approached within 6 feet. But then “one put its head down, snorted and then charged,” and the other two joined in the chase. No one was injured. Police Lt. Nolan Ryan says the yaks, native to Asia, have ear tags and are believed to have escaped from a private owner in nearby Westfield. Animal control has been notified and has a plan to corral the animals.\n\nMichigan\n\nDayton Township: A man shot ande killed an escaped alligator after he says the reptile lunged at him at his property. Derrick Fells says he was collecting minnows Saturday when he heard a “hissing” sound and the alligator tried to attack. Fells told WEYI-TV he apparently startled the reptile, and it “turned on me.” He says he shot it with a pistol and called 911. The sheriff’s office says the reptile was 5 to 6 feet long. The alligator was shot about 65 miles north of Detroit. Investigators determined that the alligator escaped from a fenced enclosure at a nearby property where an exotic animal rescue was operating. Two other alligators are there, along with snakes, tortoises, turtles and emus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:Even though the 107th annual Benton County Fair, which runs July 30-Aug. 4, has a few new features this year – expanded robotics demonstrations and new food vendors – much of the fair is still the same tried and true family-friendly festival. The fair is free for people to enter and explore the exhibits. People can purchase tickets for rides and grandstand shows. A big tradition is the rooster crowing contest – 10 a.m. Saturday at Cottonwood Stage. Other favorites include free entertainment, such as an amateur talent show and concerts. This year, the fair will feature all local bands at the beer garden stage. And people always seem to flock to the children’s barnyard year after year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Water contact warnings are in place for all Mississippi beaches because of a harmful bloom of blue-green algae, but at other times, water contact warnings and advisories are issued for another reason: feces. According to Environment America, an environmental protection group, sampling data from 4,523 beach sites in 29 coastal and Great Lakes states and Puerto Rico were submitted to the National Water Quality Monitoring Council. Of those, 2,620 sites indicated potentially unsafe levels of fecal contamination for swimming on at least one day, and 605 were potentially unsafe at least 25% of the days that sampling took place in 2018. In Mississippi, Environment America’s report states 21 of 21 beach sites sampled were potentially unsafe for at least one day in 2018. A sampling site at Gulfport East Beach in Harrison County was potentially unsafe for 44 days in 2018, more than any other site in the state. Sewage overflows and breaks are potential sources while others are more natural and washed in by rain events.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson says Col. Levon Cumpton will become the state’s adjutant general beginning Aug. 2. Cumpton is an Army Ranger and combat veteran with five deployments abroad. He earned the Combat Action Badge, a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star. He also has served in numerous National Guard activations during emergencies and disasters in Missouri. Cumpton, a Missouri native, earned a master’s degree as a graduate of the U.S. Air Force War College. He will succeed Maj. Gen. Stephen Danner, who announced his retirement.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Authorities say more than two dozen children who were removed from an alternative treatment center are being interviewed as part of an investigation into allegations of physical and psychological abuse. The 27 children between ages 11 and 17 were taken Tuesday from the Ranch for Kids program after state health officials cited “egregious abuse” allegations in recent months at the facility near the Canada border. State regulators have suspended the ranch’s license. Ranch Director Bill Sutley told the Missoulian newspaper that he plans to challenge the suspension. The children have been taken to an undisclosed location and are talking with investigators. They also received medical evaluations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A New York company is preparing to build a 230-megawatt solar power farm east of Nebraska’s capital city, making it the largest solar installation in the state. Ranger Power, which is based in Brooklyn, New York, says it has arranged leases with the owners of more than 1,000 acres near a Lincoln Electric System substation and intends to seek a local permit for the solar farm. The project development manager, Colin Snow, says Ranger has talked to three major Nebraska utilities – Lincoln Electric, Omaha Public Power District and Nebraska Public Power District – about buying the power but has not sealed any deals. The company wants to build the entire $230 million project in one phase, but that could be difficult if it does not get enough power purchase commitments. The company hopes to start construction within two years, and the work would take six to 12 months. The project would create more than 300 temporary construction jobs but only about a half-dozen permanent jobs, says Pat Haverty, vice president of the Lincoln Partnership for Economic Development.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Boat inspectors recently prevented two vessels infested with invasive mussels from launching at Lake Tahoe. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency says Wednesday both boats were quarantined until they could be decontaminated. Chris Kilian of the Tahoe Resource Conservation District says it’s a stark reminder of why inspections are mandatory at Lake Tahoe. Inspectors say they found about 100 invasive mussels – many suspected to be alive – in the hull of a powerboat traveling from Lake Pleasant, Arizona. The infestation was so large inspectors couldn’t remove them all so the boat wasn’t allowed to launch. A small sailboat that the owner said had been out of the water for about four years eventually was allowed to launch at nearby Donner Lake after officials removed approximately 20 dead mussels from the hull’s keel locker.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s recent efforts to reduce the number of patients waiting for days or sometimes weeks in emergency rooms for inpatient psychiatric care appear to be paying dividends. Data compiled by the state’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness show a steady drop in the number of such patients over the last six months. Between January and July, the daily average was 35 people, down from 49 for the same period last year. The highest daily total was in September 2017, when 72 people were waiting for beds. Bipartisan legislation aimed at addressing the problem passed that year, and lawmakers built on it this session with funding for mobile crisis teams, designated receiving beds for patients in mental health crises and supported housing for those leaving the state mental health hospital.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall:The checkered flag will wave for the final time at the Wall Stadium speedway next year, track owners announced Wednesday. The 2020 racing season will be the last for the nearly 70-year-old racetrack. Developer Pulte Homes plans to build nearly 350 homes on the site, which has held auto racing events in some form since 1950. Pulte Homes plans to build 348 homes on the site, mostly in the form of two-bedroom and three-bedroom townhouses, the owners said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has ordered state flags be lowered to half-staff on Friday in honor of a Roswell firefighter who has died from injuries suffered in the line of duty. Authorities say 46-year-old Jeff Stroble died Sunday. He was injured in a June 5 explosion that occurred while members of the Roswell Fire Department were preparing for the city’s annual Fourth of July fireworks display. Stroble was a 17-year veteran of the department.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Portions of two upstate highways are being renamed to honor state troopers killed in the line of duty. A bill signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday names bridges on Interstate 86 in the Steuben County town of Bath in honor of 29-year-old Trooper Nicholas Clark. He was shot and killed last July while responding to reports of a suicidal man. Another bill signed by Cuomo renames a portion of Route 5S in the Montgomery County town of Glen in honor of Sgt. Jeremy VanNostrand. The 36-year-old trooper died in a motor vehicle accident last November outside the barracks where he was stationed in Glen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The bleachers might be a bit more crowded for Madison High School football games and other athletic events next season after engineers recommended blocking off roughly one-third of seating on the home side of O.E. Roberts Stadium. The deterioration of the nearly 50-year-old facility raises questions on how to pay for any potential renovations to the site. Voters in Madison County will again decide on a quarter-cent sales tax increase that school officials say could help generate revenue to raise teacher pay and finance a more than $3 million project to revamp the 1972 stadium. The same referendum fell short of passage in the 2018 general election. In a July report to Madison County Schools Superintendent Will Hoffman, Kloesel Engineering listed concerns with the stadium, including spalled concrete, water drainage and a rotating retaining wall at the eastern end of the home stands between the bleachers and the athletic track.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: North Dakota health officials still don’t know the cause of two pipelines spills last week that leaked oilfield wastewater into a tributary of the Missouri River and another that spread over pastureland. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says that cleanup of the “produced water” is ongoing at the two spill sites. The spills were reported by Polar Midstream. The company on July 14 reported a 20,000-gallon spill east of Williston and about a mile from Lake Sakakawea, the largest reservoir on the Missouri River. Suess says investigators don’t think the spill reached the river. The second spill leaked more than 12,000 gallons of wastewater, impacting an unknown amount of pastureland. Company spokesman Zak Covar says the cause isn’t known. He says the focus is on cleaning up the spill.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has closed five rides at the Ohio State Fair, with one permanently shut down because of “visible corrosion.” Dorothy Pelanda is the director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, which oversees the fair. She said Thursday the four other rides could be reopened after minor repairs. The Columbus Dispatch reports Pelanda permanently shut down a Ferris wheel-type ride known as “Military Base” because it showed “visible corrosion.” A message seeking comment on the announcement was left with the company that operates the rides. The state earlier this year replaced about 100 chairs on the fair’s overhead SkyGlider and added a braking system. An 18-year-old man was killed and seven people were injured when the spinning, swinging Fire Ball ride broke apart in July 2017.\n\nOklahoma\n\nKingfisher: No injuries or damage have been reported following a small earthquake in central Oklahoma, the fourth such earthquake in the area in less than three weeks. The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 3.1 temblor was recorded at 4:39 a.m. Thursday near Kingfisher, about 40 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. A 3.1 magnitude quake and two 2.6 magnitude quakes were recorded in the same area, all on July 9. Thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. The USGS reports the number of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes is on pace to decline for the fourth straight year after state regulators began directing producers to close some wells and reduce volumes in others.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The cost of a liquor license in Oregon is going up for the first time in 70 years after newly passed legislation doubled the amount the agency will charge bars, restaurants, breweries and wineries for the right to sell alcohol to customers. The law moves Oregon’s liquor fees from among the cheapest in the nation to just below the national average for such fees, but the agency says getting on a par with other states was not the motivation. Starting Oct. 1, a full liquor license will be $800, up from $400, and winery or brewery license fees will increase from $250 to $500. All other fees will also double on and after that date.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddleburg: A bracelet that belonged to a soldier from Pennsylvania killed during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II will be returned to his daughter. An off-duty detective using a metal detector in Wales discovered the silver bracelet that contained Albert Coleman’s name and serial number. Colin Murphy tells The Daily Item he used the information to trace Coleman to Snyder County. The county historical society says Coleman got married after high school and he and his wife had a daughter. Board member Esther Klinger says the daughter was 18 months old when Coleman was killed on Jan. 17, 1945. He was buried in Pennsylvania. Coleman’s unit had been stationed in Wales before shipping off. The bracelet will be presented to his daughter, Nancy Shilling, during a ceremony at the society’s headquarters on Sunday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A delay in an international flight route coupled with airline service cuts has left T.F. Green Airport with fewer passengers. WPRI-TV reports that the airport has been seeing a fall in flights. Overall passenger activity at the airport fell more than 14% in April. Seat capacity declined by 18.5%. Regional Sky last year announced a direct flight from T.F. Green to Montreal to start in November 2018. It was later pushed to 2019. The company’s president says the airline wasn’t getting enough customers to “justify one flight.” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the agency that runs the airport, tells the board the cause of the decline is because of Southwest and other airline cuts. The airlines blame the global grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson:An estimated 600 to 700 members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club are set to ride into Clemson from July 29 to Aug. 2 for their national gathering. “They’ll come in, have a meeting, get together,” Kade Herrick, tourism director for the Clemson Area Chamber of Commerce, said. “It is almost like a family reunion for them.” News of the event, originally shared by the Seneca Journal, sparked mixed responses on social media, with some residents upset that the city had not told citizens about the event. Others were excited about the chance for businesses to bring in revenue during the slower summer months. The Department of Justice classifies Hells Angels as an “outlaw motorcycle gang“ and says the group is involved in the production of drugs and in other criminal activity. Herrick says he does not have concerns about the club coming to Clemson and did “due diligence,” reaching out to officials in Missouri and in Clarksville, Virginia, to learn about the results of similar events there.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Police will hold a town hall in east Sioux Falls on Tuesday to address several gunshot incidents in the area. Officers have responded to 10 reports of gunshots since July 8, and all have been on the east side of the city — mostly concentrated in the northeast part of Sioux Falls. The town hall will be held at 6:30 p.m. at the Kenny Anderson Community Center on East Third Street, , says Capt. Loren McManus. The recent shootings have been in the evening or before 6 a.m. In each case, police responded to witnesses saying they heard the gunshots, but officers rarely got an eyewitness account. This leaves them with little information for the search for suspects, McManus said. Background investigations have led police to believe that a majority of the shootings involve gang activity. At least two of the shootings occurred at a gang member’s home known to investigators, McManus told the Argus Leader.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:A bridge on Asheville Highway was named to honor the three victims of the fatal 2014 Knox County Schools bus crash. State Rep. Rick Staples, D-Knoxville, and State Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, R-Knoxville, held a ceremony to unveil the signs that will be displayed along Asheville Highway, near the Holston River. Zykia Burns, Seraya “Bubbles” Glasper and Kimberly Wester-Riddle died on Dec. 2, 2014, when a bus from Chilhowee Intermediate School struck a bus from Sunnyview Primary School. Burns was 6, Glasper was 7 and Riddle was 46. The bus from Chilhowee swerved across Asheville Highway and struck the bus from Sunnyview, which Burns, Glasper and Riddle were riding. It was learned that the driver of the bus from Chilhowee, James Davenport, was texting while driving, which caused him to swerve and led to the fatal crash.\n\nTexas\n\nAmarillo: A school district in the Texas Panhandle will begin drug testing students as young as 12 years old who are interested in playing sports or participating in other extracurricular activities. Testing will begin with the resumption of classes next month at Bushland Independent School District and will be required of students in grades seven through 12 who play in the band, sit on the student council, assemble a yearbook, play chess or participate in other clubs. Students who receive a permit to park at the high school also will be subjected to testing. The district does not have a drug problem or growing epidemic, district Assistant Superintendent Angie Watson said Wednesday, but the purpose is to keep students safe and “deter them from doing anything that would harm them.”\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Ogden: Officials are searching for a source of possible contamination after dozens of fish and a few ducks were found dead in a creek. KUTV-TV reports children fishing in Burch Creek discovered the dead fish and called 911 on Wednesday afternoon. The South Ogden Fire Department says nearby residents also reported smelling gas in the area. The department says between 40 and 50 fish were found dead. The Weber County Health Department says it was testing the water to determine the cause and source. The creek flows into the Weber River.\n\nVermont\n\nSalisbury: Several communities are seeing an abundance of a particular frog this summer. University of Vermont herpetology lecturer James Andrews estimates that the population of the northern leopard frog has leaped a hundredfold in a region near the Otter Creek in Addison County primarily because of the wet spring. He estimates that 400,000 young frogs were killed by cars in Salisbury. Some of the dried up carnage is still visible on the road. Andrews says the northern leopard frog lays eggs in grassy flood plains of the Otter Creek. Usually, the flood plains dry up and many of the eggs do too, but that didn’t happen this year. He says people who have been here for 30 years or more say they have never seen so many frogs.\n\nVirginia\n\nKing George: A bald eagle injured in a fight at an area landfill last month is ready to fly again. The Wildlife Center of Virginia plans to release the eagle Friday in Caledon State Park. The adult female bird was found on the ground, fighting with another eagle at the King George County landfill on June 15. The bird was treated for lead exposure and mild trauma from its fight with the other eagle. The bird has spent the past few weeks in the center’s outdoor pens, building up strength and stamina. The state park where the eagle will be released is the summer home for one of the largest concentrations of bald eagles on the East Coast.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is rolling out same-day voter registration for the primary election next month. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that residents for the first time will be able to register or update their existing registrations at county auditor or elections offices until the end of the primary period on Aug. 6. The new state law allows people to register by mail or online until eight days before an election. The state previously cut off mail and online registrations at the 29-day mark. The state also requires counties to operate voting centers in cities of more than 100,000 people during presidential elections. Several voting centers are opening in the Seattle area despite not being a presidential-election year. King County Elections Director Julie Wise says they’re testing the concept this year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s congressional delegation is asking Presdient Donald Trump to authorize federal disaster relief funds after flash flooding damaged the state’s eastern highlands late last month. U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito joined U.S. Reps. David McKinley, Alex Mooney and Carol Miller in a joint statement Wednesday asking for the federal disaster declaration. Severe thunderstorms hit Grant, Pendleton, Preston, Tucker and Randolph counties on June 29, leading to flooding and evacuations. Homes were knocked off their foundations and bridges and roads were washed out, including parts of four-lane U.S. Route 33. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has declared an emergency and the West Virginia National Guard is helping with some of the cleanup.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin would be able to increase tuition no greater than the rate of inflation under a bill being proposed in the state Legislature by the chairman of the Assembly’s higher education committee. The proposal envisions a time without a tuition freeze that has been in place for six years and will run for at least two more. The Wisconsin State Journal reports Wednesday that Republican Rep. Dave Murphy plans to introduce a bill that would allow the UW Board of Regents to raise tuition by the consumer price index increase each year. It would also lock tuition at the same rate a student pays their first year over the next three. Republican state Sen. Andre Jacque is also behind the bill, which wouldn’t take effect until the 2021 school year at the earliest.\n\nWyoming\n\nFort Laramie: Gov. Mark Gordon has declared a state of emergency to help farmers in Wyoming and Nebraska affected by an irrigation system failure. Gordon says Monday’s declaration will enable the state to deploy workers and equipment to try to solve the problem that has left more than 150 square miles of cropland without irrigation water at the peak of summer. The problem began when a 14-foot-wide tunnel for irrigation water collapsed July 17. The backed-up water washed out an irrigation canal, flooding nearby farmland. The Casper Star-Tribune reports about half of the farmland now without irrigation water is in Wyoming and the other half is in Nebraska. Crops grown there include corn and sugar beets. Repairing the irrigation system will take an estimated two to four weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/17/saving-whales-manson-murder-house-news-around-states/39695071/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville:The law that allows Sunday alcohol sales from retail stores in the city with valid state-issued liquor licenses goes into effect Aug. 1. Sales will be allowed with no time constraints. The city council approved the move during the board’s Tuesday night meeting. The ordinance passed 6-0-1, with District 3 Councilwoman Denise Brown abstaining. She serves as executive director of the Autauga Interfaith Care Center, a nondenominational charity. Last year, the council approved off-premises Sunday sales in the Elmore County portion of Prattville, after the Elmore County Commission got Legislative approval to allow the sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents of rural parts of the state will be hit with rising energy costs after a statewide funding change. The state’s Energy Desk reported that the Legislature annually transfers money from state accounts into the Constitutional Budget Reserve. Officials say a $1 billion energy account used to offset costs for rural communities is included in the transfer known as “the sweep.” Lawmakers for the past 28 years have returned the funds, until this year, when they voted not to replenish the large savings account. Companies say homeowners’ bills could increase from an average of $80 up to thousands of dollars per month.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The city’s Catholic leadership is planning to meet with local government officials about where the city can temporarily house migrants seeking asylum. The organization and county officials have a tentative agreement to move migrant families to unused portions of a Pima County juvenile detention center. Critics are opposed to placing migrants in any detention facility. Bishop Edward Weisenburger has said the hope is that migrants will feel safe and welcome as long as they are getting care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The federal government says it will allocate an additional $7 million in funding over the next 10 years to expand internet access in rural areas of the state. The Federal Communications Commission announced Monday that the funds will provide broadband access to nearly 4,000 more rural homes and businesses. In May and June, the FCC authorized a total of $40.8 million in funding. About 15,000 more rural homes and businesses will be connected to the internet when the project is complete. The FCC says it will authorize more funding in the coming months. Providers will begin receiving money from the FCC this month.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: One of the houses where followers of Charles Manson committed notorious murders in 1969 is for sale. The home in the hilly Los Feliz district is where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain the night after actress Sharon Tate and four others were murdered by Manson followers in Benedict Canyon. Redfin listing agent Robert Giambalvo tells the Los Angeles Times the two-bedroom home is priced at $1.98 million. The house has changed hands several times since 1969 and last sold in 1998.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Freight trains up to 3 miles long have been coming through the city with increasing frequency since January, according to a memo to City Council from traffic engineer Joe Olson. The “mega” trains, as Olson calls them, are in addition to regular train traffic on the BNSF Railway tracks that parallel College Avenue through much of the city. Typical trains are about a mile long. The biggest impact of a mega train is on traffic. Instead of blocking an intersection 3 to 4 minutes, like most trains, a mega train might take 15 minutes or more to pass through an intersection. Traffic backs up farther than usual and takes longer to recover. The most noticeable impacts are where the BNSF tracks cross College Avenue near Cherry Street, Olson’s memo noted. But impacts are felt all along the line, with several major east-west intersections blocked at the same time.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city is activating cooling centers for the public as it issues an excessive heat and humidity alert for the next several days. Mayor Toni Harp will start the alert at noon Wednesday while cooling centers will be open throughout the weekend and next week until further notice to provide relief from the excessive heat and humidity. Some of the cooling centers include libraries like the New Haven Public Library and the Fair Haven Branch Library. Public pools, senior centers, homeless shelters and city parks with “Splash pads,” which can be used for cooling off, will also be open.\n\nDelaware\n\nHarrington:When you’re expecting about 300,000 people for your 100th birthday party, you have to be creative when it comes to a birthday cake. That’s why the Delaware State Fair bought 30,000 packages of Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets, which will be doled out each night to some festivalgoers as part of the fair’s centennial celebration. The 100th annual Delaware State Fair kicks off Thursday with a one-day adult admission price of $5, followed by nine more days of midway rides, decadent carnival foods, livestock competitions and entertainment ranging from Grammy Award winners to a demolition derby. General admission is $9 for adults all other days, $4 for children 6-12, and free for kids 5 and younger. More details are available online.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The leader of the D.C. Council is accused of trading roles and responsibilities to other council members in exchange for backing. The Washington Post reports Chair Phil Mendelson is accused of using the quid pro quo to pass a no-bid sports betting and lottery contract and block harsh penalties for a member accused of ethics violations. The allegations highlight the growing divide between the council’s older, moderate and mostly black leaders and more recently elected members, who are mostly white and younger than 50.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The Sunshine State is the top producer of watermelon in the United States, according to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, which says Florida farmers sold 800 million pounds of watermelon last year. The largest growers are near Immokalee, Belle Glade, Arcadia and the Suwannee Valley, which produces a third of the state’s watermelon crop.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: A state biologist says beachgoers in Georgia helped keep about 30 pilot whales from stranding themselves on the shore. Clay George with the state Department of Natural Resources says the whales showed up Tuesday afternoon off the beach at St. Simons Island. Three whales beached themselves and died. But George says onlookers helped authorities wade into the water to prevent most of the whales from reaching the shore. George said harbor pilots spotted the whales in the nearby shipping channel, where he hoped they would follow the tide out to sea. George says the whales were likely confused as they usually stay more than 100 miles offshore. The American Cetacean Society says pilot whales are often involved in mass strandings partly because of their social nature.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Astronomers have indefinitely stopped looking through 13 existing telescopes at the summit of Mauna Kea while protesters block the road downslope to prevent the construction of a giant new observatory. Dozens of researchers around the world won’t be able to gather data and study the skies as a result. East Asian Observatory Deputy Director Jessica Dempsey says observations won’t resume until telescope staff have consistent access to the summit. The announcement came after Native Hawaiian protesters blocked the base of the road for a second day Tuesday. They oppose the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope out of concern it will harm an area some Native Hawaiians consider sacred. The new telescope is expected to be one of the world’s most advanced when it’s built.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a rewrite of the state’s 50-year-old mining law. Republican Gov. Brad Little and other members of the Idaho Land Board voted Tuesday to adopt rules intended to give mining companies the financial leeway to mine but also avoid leaving taxpayers paying for cleanup costs if a mining company goes bankrupt. The rules take effect immediately and come ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline set by the Legislature earlier this year. The Idaho Department of Lands plans to continue working on additional changes to the rules with public comments and bring them before lawmakers for their approval in the 2020 legislative session.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials with the Shedd Aquarium say a Beluga whale calf born less than two weeks ago is male. The aquarium’s animal care team confirmed the calf’s sex during a recent health exam. The baby whale and its mother are under 24-hour observation as the calf continues to grow and nurse. Aquarium officials say the data collected from the observation is shared with others who study wild beluga whale populations. The 38-year-old beluga, Mauyak, delivered earlier this month. Her calf was the first beluga calf at the lakefront aquarium in seven years.\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan City: Witnesses say a toddler was rescued in Lake Michigan after he drifted away from his family on an inflatable duck. Dave Benjamin tells WBBM-TV that a boater finally grabbed the boy after the duck flipped over Monday, off Washington Beach in Michigan City. Benjamin tried to reach the boy on a paddleboard. He says there was a feeling of “exhaustion and high anxiety” as the child’s inflatable was carried away by the wind. The boy’s mother couldn’t immediately reach him.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Officials say expansion by a Dubuque-based insurance broker is expected to bring more than 25 jobs to the city. The Telegraph Herald reports that Cottingham & Butler announced Monday that it will begin operating this fall in leased space that’s under construction. Cottingham & Butler’s Andy Butler says company officials have considered new locations as a way to accommodate current and future employees who live outside Dubuque. Cottingham & Butler employs 950 workers across 19 locations. About 650 work in the Dubuque area.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Attorney General Derek Schmidt says the U.S. Supreme Court’s fall docket includes three state cases, the first time that has happened in modern state history. Schmidt’s office will represent the state in all three cases. The first case to be heard this fall involves an appeal filed in a capital murder case filed by James Kraig Kahler, who killed four relatives in Burlingame in November 2009. Kahler argues Kansas law unconstitutionally prevented him from using an insanity defense. A second case arises from an identity theft case out of Johnson County and the third involves a Douglas County traffic stop. The Kansas Supreme Court overturned convictions in the last two cases, and the state is appealing.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State officials say a company that specializes in CBD oil extraction and distillation plans to build a $6 million-plus manufacturing plant in Boyle County. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office says the venture will create up to 34 full-time jobs over a decade. State officials say the announcement by International Farmaceutical Extracts is the latest sign that Kentucky’s hemp industry is flourishing. Officials say the company plans to buy an existing facility in Danville for the operation. At full capacity, the plant will use hemp flowers from about 15,000 acres of local farms.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:The state continues to sink with no help in sight, according to the latest National Geodetic Survey conducted with the help of Louisiana State University. New Orleans has fallen almost 6 inches since the first survey was conducted in 1989, but other cities farther north are also sinking. Alexandria dropped almost 2 inches during the past 30 years. Cliff Mugnier, LSU’s Chief of Geodesy, says the primary reason for the sinking is the levee system preventing the Mississippi River from flooding and depositing silt and sediment to replenish lost ground, although other factors like depleted groundwater aquifers can also contribute.\n\nMaine\n\nMadawaska: The state Forest Service is going to deploy wasps to help beat back an invasive pest species that can do damage to trees in the state. The service says the tiny, nonstinging wasps will be released Thursday to help control the emerald ash borer infestation in the state. It says the wasps feed in or on the borers by attacking their larvae under the bark of trees and parasitizing eggs on the surface of bark. The wasps will be released in Aroostook County in far northern Maine. The forest service says three species of wasps are being used in the pest control effort. The borer was located in Aroostook and York counties, at opposite ends of the state, in 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State regulators have scheduled two public comment hearings on a request by Washington Gas Light Company to increase its gas service rates by nearly $36 million. The Public Service Commission announced Monday it has scheduled a July 29 hearing in Rockville. It also announced an Aug. 6 public hearing in Largo. The PSC says that of the nearly $36 million rate-increase request, about $5 million is being collected through a system improvement surcharge. The Washington Gas application says a typical residential heating bill would increase by about 5%.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A power outage caused major problems on a Boston subway line. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said in a tweet that there was “power problem” on the Blue Line at about 8 a.m. Wednesday near the Government Center station. It said shuttle buses were replacing service between the Maverick and Bowdoin stations. A spokesman says three trains were on the track at the time. One was at a station, and another was moved back to a station so passengers could disembark. A third train was just outside the Government Center stop and 200 passengers were safely evacuated. The cause of the power problem is under investigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nSault Ste. Marie: A Native American tribe is receiving $2 million in federal funds to help build a manufacturing and warehouse facility. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the grant Tuesday for the tribe of Chippewa Indians. It will be matched with $350,000 in local funding. Officials say the Upper Peninsula tribe will own the 20,000-square-foot center. It will serve existing tribal manufacturers and entrepreneurs while helping attract new industries and business opportunities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Former U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman says all visible traces of cancer have been removed from his lung during a seven-hour surgery at Mayo Clinic. Coleman posted on his Facebook page that the cancer “was more invasive than seen in earlier scans.” Coleman praised his team of doctors who said the surgery was challenging because of scar tissue from earlier radiation. Last August, Coleman learned that the throat and neck cancer he began battling in 2015 had spread to his lungs and was at the most advanced stage. Coleman underwent chemotherapy and intensive radiation and said the tumor was gone. A follow-up scan recently showed the cancer had returned. In Monday’s surgery, doctors planned to remove about a quarter of his lung, cutting the organ’s capacity by 15% to 20%.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Police say they have confiscated several baggies filled with marijuana-infused snacks at a “dispensary party.” News outlets report police arrested five people for possession of ecstasy and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Spokesman Sam Brown told outlets Tuesday that authorities were tipped off about the party, which is typical in states where marijuana is legal. The edibles included rice crispy treats and brownies worth about $3,000. A gun, bong and other paraphernalia were also confiscated.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Bayer is closing its crop science division headquarters in North Carolina and moving 500 jobs to the St. Louis area. Gov. Mike Parson announced the move Tuesday in his Capitol office. Lisa Safarian, Bayer’s commercial operations-North America president, says the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company is closing its crop science division headquarters in the Raleigh area and moving to the St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur. Bayer will get more than $44 million in economic development incentives from the state if it meets job and investment promises. The company has agreed to $164 million in capital investments. It also pledged to keep 4,400 jobs in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Nurses working for a state hospital system have voted to unionize. The Flathead Beacon reports nurses at Kalispell Regional Healthcare facilities voted last Thursday and Friday to set up a collective bargaining unit. The approximately 650 nurses in the system are being represented by the Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW. The union says the new members will elect a bargaining committee that will survey members on their priorities for the contract negotiation. Hospital President and CEO Craig Lambrecht says in a statement that he was disappointed by the vote, but Kalispell Regional Healthcare will work with its employees during the bargaining process.\n\nNebraska\n\nChadron: A local chiropractor and a former high school track standout won top honors in the World Championship Buffalo Chip Throw contest during the 43rd annual Fur Trade Days celebration. Station KCSR reports that 35-year-old Eric Landen won the men’s title Saturday by tossing a piece of dried buffalo dung nearly 146 feet. Winning the women’s overall and 18-and-over titles was recently graduated Chadron High School track standout True Thorne with a throw of a little over 107 feet.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: Thousands of homes were left without power for several hours after a dump truck downed a power line. More than 7,000 NV Energy customers suffered a power outage at about 8:45 a.m. Tuesday when the power line was knocked down while the truck was lifting its bed in a construction zone. NV Energy says about 1,660 remained without power Tuesday afternoon but all power was expected to be restored by the evening. The truck was operating in a construction zone on El Rancho Drive near Teglia’s Paradise Park. No injuries were reported.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s only VA medical center is scaling back the hours of its clinic and urging veterans to use a network of private urgent care facilities across the state. The move to shift away from an around-the-clock clinic in Manchester starting Aug. 30 comes as Veterans Affairs presses for the use of urgent care clinics nationwide. Eligible veterans can now use nine urgent care clinics that the VA contracts with in the state. The VA medical center will continue to offer a clinic at 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. seven days a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Milford: Swimming has been banned at another state lake because of the presence of a harmful algal bloom. State environmental officials on Tuesday closed swimming areas on Greenwood Lake, which stretches about nine miles between West Milford and Orange County in New York. The directive says people should avoid making contact with the lake’s water, but notes that boating is still allowed on the waterway. Officials say bacteria in the algae bloom can cause a skin rash, and people who consume the water can suffer abdominal pain, headaches, vomiting and other issues. It’s not clear how long the directive will remain in effect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials are warning horse owners to take precautions to keep their animals from contracting a virus that causes blister-like sores on the mouths of infected animals. The state livestock board says vesicular stomatitis cases have been confirmed in Valencia, Sandoval, Los Alamos and Santa Fe counties. State Veterinarian Ralph Zimmerman says officials aren’t ordering the cancellation of any events at this point, but they’re circulating a list of recommendations for fair and rodeo organizers and individual owners. That includes checking for sores, using fly spray and not sharing grooming equipment. There’s no specific treatment and there are no licensed vaccines for the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nQuogue: Police on Long Island are searching for a bald eagle that was stolen from a wildlife refuge. Police say the approximately 35-year-old male bald eagle was removed from its enclosure at the Quogue Wildlife Refuge sometime early Tuesday morning. Police say the eagle was sent to the facility in Suffolk County by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1988 after being injured. Its right wing is partially amputated and it is unable to fly. Officials say possession of a bald eagle, which is a federally protected species, is a federal offense punishable by fines and jail time. Anyone with information is asked to call the Quogue Village police department at 631-653-4791.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: An employee at a Valvoline Instant Oil Change has been fired, the company said, after creating a racist invoice that referred to the customer as Pocahontas. A photographed invoice circulating on social media lists the customer’s name as “poka honas” and the address as Raccoon Trail, a street that does not exist in Asheville. The date of the invoice is not visible, though the original Facebook post was published July 15. The customer’s identity is not publicly known. She is a person of color, according to the Facebook user who posted about the incident. The customer was not immediately available for a request for comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say oil production in North Dakota held steady this spring. The state’s wells produced 1.39 million barrels of crude per day in May, just 800 per day more than in April. Despite the steady May numbers, North Dakota’s oil production is near the record set in January. And, the high level is creating some transportation challenges. Statewide, companies are flaring off 19% of all gas produced, higher than the 12% target.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Mosquitoes in the Greater Cincinnati area have tested positive for West Nile virus and officials are urging people to take precautions. The West Nile virus affects the central nervous system. It can be passed from mosquitoes to humans. Mosquitoes with the virus were recently trapped on Union Cemetery Road in Symmes Township, according to Hamilton County Public Health. Officials will be conducting surveillance activities in the area where the mosquitoes were collected. Staff will be looking for areas of standing water, applying larvicide and making sure swimming pools are operating properly. Health officials advise all Hamilton County residents drain all sources of water, including buckets, flowerpots, wading pools, birdbaths and pet bowls. They also suggest adding mosquito larvicide to areas of standing water that cannot be drained.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved disaster assistance for 41 counties as a result of spring flooding and severe weather in the state. The storms produced historic flooding throughout the northern half of the state and spawned a tornado that struck near Tulsa International Airport on May 21. Stitt announced the approval Tuesday, saying it makes federal funding available for cities, counties, rural electric cooperatives and the state to repair infrastructure and other costs associated with the storm response. Stitt said damage estimates from the storms stand at $22 million.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A pilot was treated and released from a hospital after crashing his plane Tuesday afternoon while attempting an emergency landing in a grassy field east of the city. Eugene Mitchell, 73, of Portland told deputies he experienced mechanical issues which led to the plane catching fire midflight while traveling from the Albany area to the Aurora Airport. Mitchell, an experienced pilot, suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. He was the only occupant of the plane, according to Sgt. Jeremy Landers with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Traffic Safety Board were notified of the crash.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An animal rescue group says someone strapped firecrackers to a cat’s front left paw with rubber bands and set them off, causing such severe injuries that the animal’s leg had to be amputated. Humane Animal Rescue says on its Facebook page that two good Samaritans brought the cat in over the weekend after finding it limping on the mangled and bloody leg. Based on how the wound had begun healing, officials at the rescue say the injury likely happened on the Fourth of July. Jamie Wilson, a director at the rescue, says there was barely any paw left and veterinarians determined the best course of action would be to remove the leg. The cat, who staffers have named Pickles, is on the mend and will be up for adoption soon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a resolution that would add $4 million to the schools’ budget to pay for 17 line items, including sports, teaching assistants, custodians, textbooks, and after-school programs. Sports were among several cuts the school committee made last month when it approved a $174 million budget. City Council President Steven Merolla said “enough with holding kids hostage.” The district has three high schools and nearly 20 schools total.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The first contracts for construction of a major African American history museum in South Carolina have been awarded. The City Council unanimously approved spending $60 million on the contracts for the museum being built on Charleston’s waterfront on the site where thousands of slaves first landed in the United States. The International African American Museum has raised more than $90 million from governments and private entities. It plans to open in 2021.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A slight uptick in heartworm disease among area pets raised a red flag last month with a national nonprofit that tracks parasites in pets and people. The city’s heartworm rate itself is small – just four heartworm cases reported in June – but the increase from May’s rate of just one case was enough to put Sioux Falls at the top of a list kept by the Companion Animal Parasite Council. The Oregon-based nonprofit uses data from two national veterinarian labs to track the prevalence of animal parasites in cats and dogs, and Sioux Falls ranked first in its “Top Ten Cities for Heartworm Disease.” The July report was released this week by the group, with Sioux Falls ranking first, followed by Rockford, Illinois; Cedar Rapids, Iowa and seven other communities across the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Agriculture is warning homeowners about rhododendron plants infected with a pathogen that can kill a number of different plants, shrubs and trees. The department says anyone who has purchased a rhododendron from Walmart or Rural King since April should monitor the plants for leaf spots and dying branches or limbs. The warning comes after the U.S. Agriculture Department detected Phytophthora ramorum in rhododendron plants at a Dickson County store. The infected plants were part of a shipment that originated from nurseries in Washington state and Canada. The department is working to trace the plants, which were sent to 18 states.\n\nTexas\n\nMineral Wells: City leaders are abandoning a proposal that would have essentially banned abortions in their community. Mayor Christopher Perricone says he proposed making his town a “sanctuary city for the unborn” after the town of Waskom became the first in Texas to do so. But at a meeting Tuesday in Mineral Wells, about 50 miles west of Dallas, city leaders voted 5-2 to take no action at the recommendation of the city’s legal staff. The Star-Telegram reported that earlier Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas sent a letter to Mineral Wells council members warning that its proposal was unconstitutional. There are no abortion clinics in either Waskom or Mineral Wells, so the measures are largely symbolic.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that found voting districts in San Juan County were racially gerrymandered and violated the rights of Navajo voters. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver handed down the opinion Tuesday in the case that resulted in the election of the first majority-Navajo commission in San Juan County, which overlaps with the Navajo Nation. Republican commissioner Bruce Adams says in a statement he’s disappointed by the ruling. He says the new districts unfairly carve up the county’s largest city of Blanding, and he had hoped for a new solution. The opinion comes after U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby found in 2016 that the voting maps packed Democratic-leaning Navajo voters into just one of three districts in the sprawling county located near the Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Public Safety Commissioner Tom Anderson is resigning at the end of the month. The office of Republican Gov. Phil Scott says Anderson is leaving July 31 to join his wife, who is working in Washington. Anderson took the job at Public Safety in January 2017, after Scott took office. Scott says Anderson has worked on a number of the governor’s priorities, including enhancing school safety, reducing supply of narcotics as part of the state’s response to the opioid epidemic and streamlining the permitting and licensure process, while upholding public safety standards.\n\nVirginia\n\nCraigsville:Craigsville Elementary School will not be closing soon, officials say. Rumors spread Tuesday that the elementary school might shutter in the next couple years, but Assistant Superintendent Doug Shifflett told The News Leader on Wednesday that wasn’t true. Shifflett directed The News Leader to Superintendent Eric Bond for comment, but Bond was out of town this week and unavailable for comment. Augusta County School Board member Nick Collins also said the rumor was not true to the best of his knowledge when reached by phone Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Hunters employed by the state have killed a radio-collared wolf that was preying on livestock in the Kettle River range of Ferry County. The adult male member of the OPT wolf pack was killed last Saturday after the pack was found to be repeatedly killing livestock. The Department of Fish and Wildlife has now entered an evaluation period to determine if killing the wolf will change the pack’s behavior. If it does not, the state can authorize the killing of more wolves in the pack. Conservation groups have complained that the state is too quick to kill wolves at the behest of ranchers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: The federal government is suing a state mental health and substance abuse facility for the homeless, citing failures to provide documentation and numerous unanswered communications. The Gazette-Mail reports a lawsuit filed recently in federal court shows attorneys with U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart’s office want ownership of Integrated Community Services’ property returned to U.S. Health and Human Services. The nonprofit was given the land in 2006, mandating it give updates about its health services. The lawsuit accuses ICS officials of not filing annual reports that prove property use and not being reachable by HHS officials.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay:Bar patrons can leave their vehicles parked overnight to avoid driving home drunk under a new initiative approved Tuesday by the City Council. The council voted unanimously to green-light the program, dubbed “Safe Park,” which will allow people to override overnight parking restrictions and leave their vehicles parked on city streets until the next day. Street parking in Green Bay is otherwise prohibited between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. “Safe Park” aims to prevent people from getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. The program was spearheaded by the Brown County Tavern League. To use “Safe Park,” people can obtain a voucher from a bartender to hang on their vehicle’s rearview mirror. Only bars that are Tavern League members can participate.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Wildlife watchers say a grizzly bear cub that was lingering alone near a mountain pass in the western part of the state has reunited with its mother. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the mother bear and cub, nicknamed Felicia and Pepper, were spotted together near Togwotee Pass on Tuesday. Onlookers had feared the cub was possibly orphaned after its mother wasn’t spotted with it. Cubs are not likely to survive on their own. Wildlife photographer Tom Mangelsen, who has been following the pair, previously said the mother and cub might have simply lost track of each other. Photographer Jack Bayles says the mother accepted the cub back and the cub has tried to nurse.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/29/nightmare-roof-fire-starting-drones-pennywise-jeep-news-around-states/40468927/", "title": "'Nightmare' roof, fire-starting drones: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: An animal expert says fencing erected by the Alabama Department of Transportation is helping to protect an endangered turtle species. University of South Alabama herpetologist David Nelson tells AL.com the number of Alabama red-bellied turtles killed on the Mobile Bay Causeway dropped by more than 80% after fencing went up alongside it in 2008. In 2001, Nelson counted 580 Alabama red-bellies that were killed while crossing the causeway. Most of those were females traveling to or from nest sites or hatchlings. Transportation officials have also put up signs during the turtle’s peak nesting and hatching seasons that encourage drivers to be cautious.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Opponents of petroleum drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preparing for a response to a possible petroleum lease sale. The Interior Department hopes to conduct a lease sale by the end of the year. More than 30 groups have joined the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign, which is a coalition dedicated to protecting the refuge that provides breeding habitat to polar bears, migratory birds and the Porcupine Caribou Herd shared with Canada. Campaign director Desiree Sorenson-Groves says the environmental review for the sale was rushed and has flaws and will be challenged in court. Her group is also warning potential bidders that companies will face damage to their reputations if they bid on leases within the refuge because it will harm polar bears and other Arctic species.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new report by an Arizona State University think tank questions whether the state can find enough water to replenish aquifers for pumping to new homes in fast-growing suburban areas without access to Colorado River water. The Arizona Daily Star reports that the Kyl Center for Water Policy report also suggests that the state revamp a landmark 1980 setting current policy on groundwater management. The report warns that some suburbs of Tucson and Phoenix will struggle to find enough water to keep growing without damaging underground aquifers by overpumping. According to the report, the result could be land subsidence, including ground fissures, lower water quality and even the possibility of wells drying up.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman woke up to find that her trailer filled with rare and ancient fossils, including dinosaur eggs that are 70 million-year-old dinosaur eggs, was gone. The trailer was taken late last month after Rodger Perkins, Gwynn Shafer and Paul Yumlu packed fossils in it for this month’s Greater Little Rock Gem, Mineral and Jewelry Show, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Perkins says the trailer had skulls of the perchoerus, a piglike mammal that is one of the rarest of fossils; the doglike cynodictis; the marine reptile keichousaurus; and a pair of baby rabbits that died nearly 15 million years ago. He says the fossils were worth nearly $20,000. Perkins doubts that whoever stole the trailer knew what was inside but says the thieves likely know how expensive the fossils are because they had price tags on them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star in the House, announced her resignation amid an ethics probe, saying explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been “weaponized” by her husband and political operatives. The California Democrat, 32, had been hand-picked for a coveted leadership seat. But in recent days, compromising photos of Hill and purported text messages from her to a campaign staffer surfaced online in a right-wing publication and a British tabloid. The House ethics committee had launched an investigation into whether Hill had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office, prohibited under House rules. Hill, one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress, has vowed to fight a “smear” campaign waged by a husband she called abusive.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Planning is in the works to build a new Veterans Affairs clinic that will give veterans in northern Colorado better access to health care. The Cheyenne Veterans Affairs Health Care System announced that the Loveland clinic is expected to open by the winter of 2022. VA spokesman Sam House tells the Loveland Reporter-Herald that more than half of the population that is served in the Cheyenne system area comes from northern Colorado. House says the facility will more than double the space of the current Loveland and Fort Collins clinics combined and serve more than 200 veterans a day. Construction should start by next summer and take two years to complete. When the new facility opens in 2022, the VA will close its Fort Collins clinic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haddam: Hundreds of acres in eastern Connecticut are in the process of being acquired by the state to expand existing parks and wildlife conservation areas, but thousands more need to be attained or protected in order to meet a fast-approaching goal of protecting 21% of Connecticut land as open space by 2023. Eric Hammerling, executive director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, says the state still has “a ways to go” and hopes officials will keep pushing to reach the goal. Last week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney announced $560,000 in federal funds to protect more than 400 acres in eastern Connecticut, including nearly 100 acres that will be added to the Devil’s Hopyard State Park in East Haddam.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s only NASCAR racetrack continues to shrink. Reflecting waning attendance nationwide for the popular motor sport, Dover International Speedway, also known as the Monster Mile, will reduce seating at its grandstands to 54,000 from 83,000. It is at least the third time that track owner Dover Motor Sports has removed thousands of seats at the facility in the past decade. Prior to 2009, capacity stood at 135,000. Rebuilding the grandstand with fewer seats will cost the publicly traded company $1.5 million. The project is underway and is scheduled to be complete before the racetrack’s spring NASCAR event.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo has announced the birth of one lesser kudu and the death of another. The Washington Post reports the male calf was born Oct. 14, just weeks after his grandmother died. Citing a news release, news outlets report the zoo says the healthy calf may make his public debut this fall. The calf was born to a kudu named Rogue, who was the daughter of a kudu named Shirley. The 9-year-old Shirley died late last month after what the zoo described as complications during the birthing process. Her calf was stillborn. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says the lesser kudu is a type of antelope considered to be “near threatened,” with a declining wild population of about 100,000.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Homeless people living with HIV now have secure locations in the city where they can store their expensive medications. Through the IDEA Exchange, patients can store their medicine in lockers at a converted shipping container office. They also can choose to have social workers deliver small quantities of the medicine to them. The program is run by the University of Miami. Prescriptions are paid for by Medicaid or a federal drug assistance program for low-income people living with HIV. Storing medication for the homeless has long been encouraged by public health experts. Washington, D.C., New York, Boston and other cities offer similar services. University of Miami physician Hansel Tookes, who directs the Miami program, says the initiative began in 2018 after an HIV outbreak among the city’s homeless.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service says crews will spend several months cleaning out years of accumulating storm debris and dead wood around a Civil War-era fort on the Georgia coast. Fort Pulaski National Monument east of Savannah still has a large debris pile left over from the passing of hurricanes Matthew and Irma, as well as a tornado, in 2016 and 2017. Dead and damaged trees remain in the woods outside the fort. The Park Service says in a news release that a cleanup project will remove the debris and dead wood to reduce wildfire risks. Work began in October and is expected to continue until spring. Officials say the work may require temporary closure of some areas of the park outside Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Researchers have found the majority of plastic marine debris washing up on the state’s shores is from abroad. The Star-Advertiser reports the study conducted at Hawaii Pacific University revealed that pollution from north and east island beaches is washing ashore where there are fewer residents and tourists. Researchers say it is possible the debris swept in from as far as 3,000 miles away from the coasts of Asia, as well as the Americas. Researchers say more than 4,600 pieces of plastic debris were collected for the study from three sea surface areas, three seafloor dive sites and 11 shorelines. Researchers say based on weathering and chemical composition, the debris could tell experts where it came from and how it got to island shores.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have made it more difficult for young transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling that appears to ban such obstacles. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare released comments from the public last week on a temporary rule requiring people younger than 18 to get approval from medical or mental health professionals before requesting the change. Many of the comments said they wanted the conservative state to go back to banning all gender changes on birth certificates. A federal judge ruled last year that an Idaho law barring transgender people from changing their birth certificates violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Health and Welfare’s board of directors complied with the order and changed the state’s rules last year. But this May, the board approved the temporary rule requiring anyone under 18 to get approval before requesting the change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is endorsing legislation that would allow college athletes in the state to make money from endorsements. During a Sunday interview on WGN-Radio, Pritzker said college athletes deserve the same opportunity as everyone else to earn compensation based on the use of their name and their image and likeness. Democratic state Rep. Emanuel Welch of Hillside has introduced legislation that would put Illinois in line with California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this year allowing athletes at the state’s universities to use their names and likenesses to make money. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. Illinois House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs said Sunday that he would urge his GOP colleagues to oppose Welch’s proposed legislation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will change the vendor of its teacher licensing exams following complaints about low pass rates under the current program. Test administrator ETS will replace Pearson starting in September 2021. The move comes after Republican state Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg introduced legislation this year requiring the state to adopt a national teacher licensing program to replace Pearson’s, which customizes exams to Indiana standards. The Tribune-Star reports Leising says the change will help address the state’s teacher shortage. Some people have said Pearson’s exams are too difficult. Tim McRoberts, associate executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, says Pearson doesn’t provide adequate study materials, which makes it difficult for students to prepare. He says there’s no doubt testing changes could be helpful.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An eastern Iowa school district has secured federal grant funding to monitor students’ social media accounts for possible warning signs that students might harm themselves or their peers. The Iowa City Community School District received the grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. A portion of the $187,000 grant is earmarked to contract with a company that will scan social media posts. It’s part of a districtwide push to improve safety across the school district. School officials have not yet determined what all the monitoring will entail. School officials note that the district already has the right to look at the emails and Google Drive accounts of students who are using district technology.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kris Kobach has acknowledged in a diversion agreement that he failed to properly supervise his staff while representing himself as the then-Kansas secretary of state during federal court proceedings. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the confidential agreement resolves complaints made to the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator’s Office about Kobach’s conduct in a voter registration case. Details of the findings aren’t disclosed under Kansas rules, but a public notice of the agreement says Kobach stipulates he didn’t properly supervise lawyers and non-lawyers during the litigation. The lawsuit involved a challenge to a Kansas law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. The disciplinary administrator’s office says there was no finding of dishonest conduct by Kobach, who is seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Pennywise the clown has returned to terrorize Derby City, and he’s driving a 2005 Jeep Wrangler. The monster at the heart of the new “It: Chapter Two” film and the shape-shifting villain of Stephen King’s classic horror novel now sits in the driver’s seat next to Andrew Johnson, the owner of a modified SUV with a passenger-side steering wheel and a whole collection of creepy props and decals. The Louisville resident and self-employed auto mechanic has spent the past six years dressing up his two SUVs to fit certain themes. The “It” Jeep, though, has been his biggest hit yet. It has decals with popular phrases and references to the movie. It has theatrical blood sprayed across its white exterior – “if it gets wet,” Johnson says, “it actually drips.” It has two arms pulling poor Georgie’s yellow rain jacket into the Jeep’s grill. And it has a 6-foot-3 clown with glowing eyes and trademark red balloons in the driver’s seat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCameron: What used to be Louisiana’s largest state wildlife refuge is celebrating its centennial. The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge was 86,000 acres when the land was bought in 1914 and donated to the state in December 1919. Officials say it’s now down to about 71,500 acres. That’s about a 17% loss. The southwest Louisiana refuge has been a site for research to reduce coastal erosion, such as finding ways to build stone breakwaters light enough not to sink in the soft silt near what remains of the shore. There’s also been a great deal of wildlife research, including studies that helped alligators and bald eagles get off the endangered list. Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet describes the refuge as a giant outdoor laboratory.\n\nMaine\n\nGeorgetown: An environmental group is working with shellfish farmers to grow more of a species of clam it thinks can better stand up to predators that have plagued the state’s harvest of bivalves. Seafood lovers have sought Maine’s softshell clams for decades, but the state’s harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Massachusetts-based group Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers to grow quahogs in Maine and study the results. The federal government’s NOAA Sea Grant has taken notice and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The State Department of Education has responded to concerns about Holocaust instruction by announcing plans to enhance and expand how it’s taught. A statement released by the department says the changes include teaching middle schoolers about anti-Semitism and strengthening Holocaust education for high schoolers. News outlets report advocates and elected officials had raised concerns about state curriculum guidelines. Baltimore Jewish Council executive director Howard Libit says the council thought the guidelines didn’t do enough to ensure students learn about the Holocaust. State Superintendent Karen B. Salmon said in the statement that the education department plans to provide teachers with tools to help them teach the Holocaust with confidence.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Worcester Polytechnic Institute has received a five-year, nearly $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a robotic system to detect and monitor prostate cancer. Grant recipient Haichong Zhang, a biomedical engineer at the school, says his surgical imaging robot will be safer and more accurate than current tests, including ultrasounds and biopsies. Zhang tells The Telegram & Gazette he wants to create a minimally invasive, easily accessible and cost-effective way to better detect prostate cancer, which will affect one-fifth of all men at some point in their lives. Zhang is working on the project with Gregory Fischer, a professor of robotics and mechanical engineering at WPI.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A local museum will begin charging patrons from outside the Motor City area an admissions fee for the first time in seven years to remedy an increasing budget deficit. The Detroit News reports that the Detroit Historical Museum will charge adults $10, while seniors, students, active-duty military and first responders will pay $8. Children ages 6 to 17 will pay $6. Museum executive director Elana Rugh says the museum lost $297,000 in 2018. The museum’s 2019 operating budget is about $4.5 million. Residents of Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck will be able to enter at no cost. Detroit historian Ken Coleman says he worries the fee will prevent low-income people from other places from visiting the museum.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Clergy and immigration activists are trying to remove the name of a revered bishop from a federal building where hundreds of deportation orders are issued every year, calling the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown an affront to his memory. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling houses the Minneapolis-area offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It’s named for the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, who persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to pardon most of the 303 Dakota Indians sentenced to death after the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, though 38 were still hanged in the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Now the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches and others want Whipple’s name taken off the building – or the eviction of ICE and its immigration courts. They’re planning a vigil and news conference outside it Tuesday to launch the “What Would Whipple Do?” campaign. They’ll also call on the Legislature to declare Minnesota a sanctuary state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant says the state’s cash reserves are at their highest level ever. The Republican said Friday that the state Department of Finance and Administration has transferred just over $205 million into the state rainy day fund. The money was the unspent surplus for state government for the budget year that ended June 30. With the transfer, the rainy day fund has hit its limit, by law, of $554.8 million. Bryant said on Twitter that the amount of money in the fund is “the most in Mississippi’s history.” Republicans who lead the budget-writing process in the Legislature say conservative spending practices led to the surplus that filled the rainy day fund. Critics say Mississippi government is underfunding education, health care and other core services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state panel wants a test track for an ultra-high-speed Hyperloop system to be built in the Show-Me State. The group of elected officials and business leaders made the recommendation Monday as part of a study commissioned by the House speaker. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds of more than 600 mph. Advocates want to connect Kansas City to St. Louis with the high-speed system. The report says Missouri first would need to apply to be the site for a roughly 15-mile test track that could cost between $300 million and $500 million. The estimated cost to build a full hyperloop system across Missouri ranges from $30 million to $40 million per mile, or about $7.3 billion to $10.4 billion total.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: National Weather Service meteorologists say snowfall in the state has broken a 35-year-old record. Through Monday afternoon, more than 35 inches of snow has been recorded in Great Falls in September and October. Scientists say the amount sets a record for the timeframe beginning July 1, blasting past the previous record of 18.1 inches in 1984. Meteorologists say that is well over half of the 60 inches that routinely falls during an entire snow season. Meteorologists say snow is expected to continue with record-breaking cold through mid-November. Scientists say the average temperature in October has been 40.3 degrees, about 5.9 degrees below normal. Scientists say residents should be prepared as current weather continues to behave more like December or January.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: University of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers have launched a university-backed startup company to help prevent and fight wildfires with drones. The university on Monday announced the new business venture, Drone Amplified, which is headed by Carrick Detweiler, an associate professor of computer science and engineering. The company’s drone-mounted technology carries chemical spheres the size of pingpong balls. At the press of a button, the spheres ignite, intentionally sparking small fires to burn vegetation and deprive incoming wildfires of potential fuel. The drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras to help spot hotspots, and they can be used in situations that are unsafe for manned aircraft, such as low-visibility nighttime operations. University researchers tested the technology in 2016 with a controlled fire at the Homestead National Monument of America near Beatrice.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A developer who grew up going to the Huntridge Theater is poised to get city approval to buy the shuttered former movie house in central Las Vegas, renovate its damaged roof and convert it to an arts hub. J Dapper tells the Las Vegas Sun the architecture won’t change, but the building dating to 1943 could be converted into a concert venue, a performance auditorium or a community arts space. Dapper says he also hopes to put restaurants, condominiums or office space on the 4-acre parcel at Charleston Boulevard and Maryland Parkway to make the venture more profitable. Dapper needs city approval because the property has been listed since 1993 on the National Register of Historic Places. A City Council vote is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald is telling residents to be aware of scammers targeting personal information through the use of popular phone-based word games, such as Words with Friends. The game’s app is downloaded for players to take turns building words in a crossword-style fashion, similar to Scrabble. Authorities say scammers use the app’s communication function to ask users questions to gain personal information that’s used to exploit the individual. They say scammers also try to seek a personal or romantic connection and urge the user to send gift cards, money and valuable property. Scammers also will send harmful links and ask users to switch to other platforms that make it easier for the scammer to access the user’s personal information. Authorities say players should only communicate with people known to them.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Jersey rock royalty was onstage Sunday night in the state’s musical cradle as rocker Jon Bon Jovi brought crooner Southside Johnny Lyon with him into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The two rockers played a duet at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall, where both had performed many times on their way up from Jersey shore local bar bands to worldwide stars. Pop rock band The Smithereens was also inducted this year. In the performing arts category, Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza on “Seinfeld,” made the cut. Inductees in the category of arts and letters included “Jaws” author Peter Benchley, longtime Star-Ledger sports columnist Jerry Izenberg, “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin and photographer Timothy White.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State wildlife officials are rejoining direct efforts to manage endangered Mexican gray wolf populations in cooperation with the federal government and counterparts including Arizona. The New Mexico State Game Commission voted unanimously with one absence Friday to become a cooperating agency in the recovery program after leaving a pact in 2011. Wildlife Division Chief Stewart Liley says the agreement will make New Mexico a lead player in the program with greater discretion over management decisions amid concern among ranchers about livestock falling prey to wolves. The Mexican wolf is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America and has struggled since releases into the wild in 1998. Surveys show at least 131 in the wild in the southern mountain ranges of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The eastern hellbender will get more protection and the bald eagle and peregrine falcon will get less under proposed changes to New York’s list of endangered and threatened species. The Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing removal of 19 species from the state’s endangered and threatened list. Those species including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon show significant population growth, making them no longer threatened. There are now 390 pairs of breeding bald eagles in New York, compared to one pair when they were listed as endangered in 1973. The agency is proposing to add 18 other species as threatened or endangered. They include several species of freshwater mussels, the common nighthawk and the eastern hellbender salamander. Public comments on the list proposals are being taken until Dec. 24.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Parts of the state’s textile, agricultural and railroad past have been recognized as national historic places, a designation that can help preserve them. The state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said in a news release that seven North Carolina properties have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. They include Caromount Mills in Rocky Mount; Sanford Tobacco Co. redrying plant and warehouse in Sanford; Carolina and Northwestern Railway freight depot in Lenoir; and Taylorsville Milling Co. roller mill in Taylorsville. Also added to the list were the T. Austin and Ernestine L. Finch house in Thomasville; the Gem Theatre in Kannapolis; and the Bunyan S. and Edith W. Womble house in Winston-Salem. Federal and state incentives are created to help preserve National Register places.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWillow City: Wildlife officials say a state game warden escaped serious injuries when he was attacked by a bull moose. Game & Fish Department Chief Game Warden Robert Timian tells KFGO radio that District Game Warden Jonathan Toftland was in the Willow City area Wednesday to investigate a report of an injured or sick bull moose. As Toftland approached the animal, it stood up and charged him, knocking him to the ground. The moose was killed. Timian says the outcome could have been “far worse” and credits help from others who were in the area for helping Toftland. The game warden was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. Timian says investigators are trying to determine if the bull moose was sick.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Some state lawmakers say they hope to prevent numerous vehicle crashes by gradually installing rumble strips down the center of some roads. Ohio Rep. Timothy E. Ginter, a Salem Republican, is chief sponsor of a bill to require the state Department of Transportation to add rumble strips on all undivided, two-way highways with speed limits higher than 45 mph. The Dayton Daily News reports the House passed the bill unanimously in June, and the Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing on it last week. State Highway Patrol data shows more than 500 people have died in the past five years due to drivers crossing over the center of undivided Ohio highways. The Federal Highway Administration says rumble strips have reduced rural two-lane road crashes by about 45% nationwide.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group trying to prevent partisan gerrymandering of Oklahoma’s legislative and congressional districts is seeking a public vote on whether to create a new bipartisan commission to redraw district boundaries. A group that includes the president of the Oklahoma League of Women Voters and Let’s Fix This, an organization aimed at helping Oklahomans engage politically, filed its petition Monday with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. The group is seeking to gather enough signatures to place the proposed constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot. Under the plan, the power to draw both legislative and federal congressional districts would be transferred from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission. The commission would include an equal number of Republicans, Democrats and representatives unaffiliated with either party selected by a group of retired judges.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A group of wine industry interests in the state have formed a new trade group. The Eugene Register-Guard reports the new coalition is called the Oregon Wine Council, and it has an agenda that differs from the Oregon Wine Association. Members of the new group earlier this year opposed wine legislation they viewed as anti-competitive. They claim to represent the interests of the entire state. Board member Sam Tannahill says the majority of large, taxpaying wine growers as well as many of small producers around the state don’t have a say in how their tax money is spent. A board member of the Oregon Wine Association, Justin King, says the argument that his organization is made up of selfish people from one area of the state is patently false.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The front of a city bus was up in the air Monday after a sinkhole opened under it during rush hour downtown. The Port Authority of Allegheny County says only the driver and one passenger were aboard the bus when it plunged into the hole. The passenger was taken to a hospital for a minor injury Monday, and the driver was not injured. The agency tweeted that the bus was at a red light when the street gave way, and the rear half plunged into the hole. A photo shows the front of the bus pitched into the air and the front wheels of a car that was behind it dangling over the sinkhole’s edge. A tow truck was brought in late Monday to remove the bus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor and public school superintendents are trying to raise awareness about the importance of regularly reading to children. “SUPERS Read,” a statewide reading event, began Monday and continues through Nov. 8. Superintendents and other guest readers will read to infants and toddlers enrolled in local child care and Early Head Start programs. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and education leaders will kick off the event Monday at the Children’s Workshop in Warren. Raimondo also plans to unveil an updated website that makes accessing state programs for young children and families more straightforward. The Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children, United Way of Rhode Island and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT organized the reading celebration to highlight the importance of reading to children to promote school readiness.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s prisons says his agency will begin classifying inmates by their behavior behind bars, not the crime they committed. Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the reclassification could reduce the number of maximum-security inmates by 4,000. There are currently about 7,000 inmates in maximum security in South Carolina prisons. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston moving inmates from maximum security will let them move in prison more freely, take more classes and go on work-release programs. They also can become eligible for parole quicker. To get out of maximum security, prison officials say inmates must not be in gangs and must follow the rules. Stirling says consolidating maximum security will allow his chronically short staff to concentrate on the worst behaved inmates.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Entrance and camping fees to state parks will likely cost more next year. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission has approved fee increases for 2020. An annual state park pass will be $36, an increase of $6. A day pass will be $8, a $2 increase. Camping fees for prime sites will increase $5 to $26, and preferred sites will increase from $19 to $23. The commission says a wet spring made 10% of campsites temporarily unavailable this year, and revenue is down by $1.9 million compared to last year. And it’s estimated that repairs to campsites, roads and boat ramps damaged by flooding will cost $8 million. The Rapid City Journal says the fee increases still need approval from the Legislature’s Interim Rules Committee.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A psychiatrist whose license was suspended last year for using riding crops on patients may now lose her license again over allegations that she violated her professional probation. The state Board of Medical Examiners says Dr. Valerie Augustus didn’t participate in therapy sessions or reimburse the state $50,000 for the cost of the case. The newspaper recently obtained new charges the state Department of Health filed against Augustus last month, accusing her of misconduct and violating a board order. The board has said the 57-year-old Christian Psychiatric Services operator used a crop or whip on at least 10 patients. Augustus appealed the ruling, saying the whipping was done jokingly. A hearing is set for January.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Police Department has unveiled a new crime lab in a move to accelerate service and shed its scandal-ridden past linked to a backlog of rape kits. Police and city officials several years ago started the process of untangling the lab from the department and into an independent agency, the Houston Forensic Science Center. In 2014, the department transferred management of its crime lab to the center even though the physical lab remained in the Police Department’s downtown headquarters. The Houston Chronicle reports that authorities said the new facility was revealed last week and features state-of-the-art labs, ventilation systems and a consolidated design. The center’s president, Dr. Peter Stout, says the 83,000-square-foot space will serve as a model for the rest of the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A college professor has completed a massive project decorating the exterior of his house in an elaborate Halloween tribute to Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion and the “Nightmare Before Christmas.” Dixie State University professor Josh Pedersen studied more than 200 images of the attraction to model the design as close to the original as possible. He started by creating digital plans for an intricate pattern along his roofline, then printed the design using a large-format laser printer available at a university Makerspace. Once the pattern was cut out and attached to a base, he added 168 electric candles and 66 fake pumpkins. Many people pitched in to help with the installation, which took about a week. Pedersen says he’s wanted to do the project for years.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The Vermont National Guard has received 14 noise complaints since the first two F-35 fighter planes arrived at the Burlington International Airport last month. Capt. Mike Arcovitch, whose office tracks noise complaints, says the complaints came from eight people, and two were anonymous. The F-35s are louder than the F-16s the guard used to fly. He says officials had expected more noise complaints when the new jets started flying from the South Burlington airport that is home to the Vermont Air National Guard. The guard took delivery last month of the first two of what will be 20 F-35s, all due in the state by summer. Arcovitch says the guard used to receive noise complaints about the F-16s as well, but he did not have a comparison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health regulators are asking lawmakers to greenlight a licensing system for music therapy. The Daily Press reports that regulators want to set credentialing standards for therapists as well as set up a system for the state to look into any complaints. Music therapy is used to help people with various medical conditions develop everything from language skills to motor coordination. It can provide a drug-free way to regulate moods in people with depression or foster socialization in those with limited means of communication. It gained popularity in veterans’ hospitals in World War II as doctors became interested in music’s ability to heal soldiers with both physical and mental problems.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An anti-tax activist is again bringing a $30 car-tab initiative to voters that would cut a major source of funding for transportation projects across the state. Sponsored by Tim Eyman, Initiative 976 would lower most taxes paid through annual vehicle registration to $30 and largely revoke the authority of state and local governments to add taxes and fees without voter approval. The measure would also repeal taxes and fees already in place, a move the state Office of Financial Management says could cost the state and local governments more than $4 billion in revenue over the next six years. Eyman says the November ballot measure is a chance for voters to tell their government that they voted years ago for $30 car tabs, and they meant it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Officials have pulled off a creative rescue of a malnourished German shepherd that was stuck in a dam. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports an animal control officer said the dog had probably been trapped in the Ada dam for several days before the rescue. The effort began Friday afternoon when a 911 call came in for an injured and skinny dog in the spillway. But rescuers couldn’t get into the dam, and its tall, steep walls made it impossible for the dog to climb out. So officials used a rope to lower a trap baited with food into the spillway. After about 2 1/ 2 hours, the dog finally went into the trap, and the rescue workers brought him to a shelter. There, they named him Lucky.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJanesville: Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has launched a new nonprofit organization he says will be focused on fighting poverty, increasing economic opportunities and advancing evidence-based public policies. Ryan announced the launch of the American Idea Foundation on Monday. He moved more than $7 million from his congressional account into the nonprofit when he announced its formation earlier this year. The foundation will be based in Ryan’s hometown, Janesville, though he moved his family to Maryland this year. Ryan decided against seeking re-election last year, ending his 20-year career in the House. The Republican from Janesville has kept a mostly low profile since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to provide $12.1 million to expand broadband coverage to rural parts of the state over the next decade. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports three companies are expected to receive funds to extend service to more than 4,700 homes and businesses lacking high-speed internet access. The FCC says Inventive Wireless of Nebraska, Tri County Telephone and Union Telephone will receive funding. Officials say service will be expanded in seven counties: Albany, Big Horn, Niobrara, Park, Platte, Sublette and Uinta. A Wyoming State Broadband Program survey of more than 2,400 residents found 26.9% of respondents lacked reliable broadband.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/02/pony-hit-run-church-strip-club-lawnmower-dui-news-around-states/40232203/", "title": "Around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: The Tuskegee Airmen’s legacy will take flight once again with the launch of a new Air Force jet. The Opelika-Auburn News reports that the Air Force is honoring the famed group of airmen with the naming of its new trainer jet – the Boeing T-7A. Military officials last year chose the T-7A as the next-generation trainer jet for the Air Force. It will be known as the Red Hawk and carry the same red-tail markings. The all-black Tuskegee aviators broke racial barriers with their courage and aviation skills. They were known as the Red Tails because of the iconic red paint on the tail of their aircraft.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new report says the state saw its highest violent crime rate in five years in 2018. The Anchorage Daily News reports the state’s sexual assault rate rose 11% between 2017 and 2018 and stood at nearly four times the national rate. But the report, based on crime data, showed property crime and vehicle thefts lower. There were 47 homicides last year, compared to 62 in 2017. The Alaska Department of Public Safety’s annual report on crime is based on information supplied by law enforcement agencies that represent most of the state’s population. It was released Monday, as was the FBI’s national look at crime that uses the same information.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildlife officials say fewer bald eagles have been born in the state this year despite a record number of breeding areas for the 2019 season. The Arizona Game and Fish Department says raptor biologists have counted 71 eagle nestlings this year, down from 87 hatched in 2018. The birds are protected nationally by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Arizona population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted in the state. There are now an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs. Wildlife experts attribute the population’s gradual recovery to the efforts of a committee comprised of Arizona Game and Fish, other government agencies, private organizations and Native American tribes.\n\nArkansas\n\nBrickeys: A convicted killer who baffled prison officials by seemingly vanishing was found Tuesday hiding underneath a large ventilation hood on the prison roof. Authorities had suspected inmate Calvin Adams didn’t make it past the electric fence surrounding the East Arkansas Regional Unit in Brickeys, about 110 miles east of Little Rock, according to Arkansas Department of Corrections spokeswoman Dina Tyler. The fence can’t be cut, is deadly if touched and has concrete at its base to prevent anyone from digging under it, she said. For more than a day, Adams’ whereabouts were a mystery. “He can’t fly, and we don’t believe the aliens plucked him out. So where is he?” Tyler said Tuesday shortly before authorities discovered Adams’ hiding place. She said he was in good health and will be moved to a maximum-security area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: Authorities are searching for a hit-and-run driver who struck a pony that was loose on a Los Angeles-area freeway, leaving the small horse slightly injured. The California Highway Patrol says a 10-year-old boy had been riding the pony Sunday at a home when he fell off, and the animal ran away. The CHP says the pony made its way onto westbound State Route 91 in Long Beach, where it was clipped by a black SUV. The driver sped away. CHP Officer Marco Iniguez told the Los Angeles Times that someone stopped to help the injured animal, which suffered abrasions to its forelegs. The horse was evaluated by animal control officers and reunited with its owner.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The City Council has approved a $50,000 settlement with a journalist who was handcuffed and detained by police after she photographed them standing around a naked, handcuffed man seated on a downtown sidewalk. Denverite reports the council approved the settlement late Monday with Susan Greene, editor of The Colorado Independent. Officers also will undergo additional First Amendment training. Denver police said Officers Adam Paulsen and James Brooks violated police policy in the July 2018 encounter, when they took Greene’s smartphone and placed her in a patrol car for about 10 minutes. Greene was exercising her First Amendment rights to observe and record police activity. The officers were docked two days’ pay. Greene says the officers told her to “act like a lady.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Thirteen communities across the state are on tap to receive $13 million in federal grants aimed at helping smaller cities modernize and rehabilitate housing. Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruno announced the grants designed to help improve housing for low- and moderate-income individuals. Eligible projects have to be in a municipality with fewer than 50,000 residents and have a focus on improving neighborhoods, eliminating blight and attracting economic development. One of the projects is Mystic River Homes in Groton. The $1.5 million grant will help pay for elevator replacements and a new fire system pump, hot water system upgrades and a new backup generator.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A new historical marker recognizing a 1903 lynching will be unveiled during a public ceremony Oct.20, less than three months after the original was stolen from Greenbank Park. A resident noticed the missing marker, which had only been in the park for six weeks, on Aug. 1 and called police. It had been erected in honor of the black laborer George White, who died at the hands of a white lynch mob in 1903. Police are still investigating who stole the sign, and Delaware Crime Stoppers is offering a $2,000 reward to anyone who provides information leading to an arrest and conviction. In the meantime, a new marker even larger than the first one will be put up during the dedication ceremony.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new report on school access by the D.C. Policy Center shows hundreds of students can’t physically get to the school that would best suit their needs, WUSA-TV reports. Chelsea Coffin, director of the center’s Education Policy Initiative and the study’s author, examined schools that show the most improvement for at-risk students, defined as children who are homeless or receiving government assistance. She found most so-called leveler schools are farthest from the kids who need them most. Coffin said hundreds of children living east of the Potomac River don’t have the option of driving to school. Data from the deputy mayor of education shows children in Wards 7 and 8 travel the longest to get to school, with routes averaging over an hour.\n\nFlorida\n\nWellington: A church that currently meets at a high school is considering buying a former strip club to hold its services. The Palm Beach Post reports officials at NewSound Church are in negotiations to purchase the Double Dee’s Ranch building that was once owned by a man accused of mob ties. It closed late last year. Pastor Josh Mauney told the Post that the church is looking to expand “whether in this location or another.” The church was established in 2018 and meets at Wellington High School. The ex-strip club offers 20,000 square feet of space. It is listed for $9 million and has been on the market since November 2018.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State officials say 82% of seniors graduated on time from high school in 2018-2019, the highest share on record. The nationwide graduation rate was 85% in 2016-2017, the most recent data available. Georgia’s graduation rate has historically lagged both national and regional graduation rates. State officials say Georgia’s graduation rate has risen from 70% in 2012. Among Georgia’s 181 school districts, the state Department of Education says 71 saw graduation rates of 90% or more, while 24 districts saw graduation rates of 95% or more. Federal law requires the state to calculate a four-year graduation rate. State Superintendent Richard Woods says he salutes the teachers and students “doing the on-the-ground work that leads to increases in our graduation rate.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials say a decreased birthrate has larger population and economic implications for the state now and in the future. Hawaii Public Radio reports recent data shows the number of babies born in Hawaii has been declining for a decade, following a national trend. Hawaii’s current birthrate is 10% lower than in 2008. The economic effects include reports by at least two Oahu hospitals of decreases in work shifts for maternity ward nurses and a reduction in new nurse hiring. Officials say the decrease in the number of babies could also lead to a drop in the amount of Hawaii workers and taxpayers in the future. Officials say the state’s population has decreased in recent years as the number of people leaving outpaces new arrivals.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a man’s request to dismiss an environmental group’s lawsuit against him concerning suction dredging for gold in Idaho rivers without required federal permits. Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald E. Bush ruled Monday that the Idaho Conservation League has standing to bring the citizen enforcement lawsuit against Shannon Poe of Concord, California. Bush wrote that Poe in multiple years admitted in online posts to dredging Idaho rivers while recognizing the need to obtain permits and his defiance to do so. The Idaho Conservation League sued in 2018, contending Poe was violating the federal Clean Water Act by dredging in critical habitat for federally protected steelhead, salmon and bull trout. The lawsuit asks Bush to impose civil penalties that can surpass $50,000 a day.\n\nIllinois\n\nMetropolis: The annual encampment at Fort Massac State Park will be held Oct. 19-20. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the Greater Metropolis Convention and Visitors Bureau sponsor the event in Metropolis that provides visitors a chance to experience life as it was at Fort Massac in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Fort Massac was a military outpost along the Ohio River for France, Britain and the early United States from 1757 to 1814. The event will be 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Oct. 19 and 9 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Oct. 20. The festival will feature mock military battles and tactical demonstrations by reenactors on the Fort Massac grounds. Each day will open with a “Posting of the Colours” and close with a military retreat ceremony.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Sixteen students were hospitalized as a precaution Monday after they were mistakenly injected with insulin during a tuberculosis skin test, according to school officials. The Metropolitan School District of Lawrence Township says the students from the McKenzie Center for Innovation & Technology were taken to hospitals for observation after being injected with a “small dosage” of insulin by Community Health Network personnel. The tuberculosis skin test requires an intradermal injection of liquid – 0.1 milliliter of a purified protein derivative called tuberculin – in the lower part of their arm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The district says it’s working closely with Community Health Network “to determine the cause of the error.”\n\nIowa\n\nHiawatha: The city’s police department is adding cameras to its handguns. Hiawatha Police Chief Dennis Marks told KCRG that the new cameras will help ensure that a full recording will be made of any incident when officers pull their weapons. Marks says body cameras can be obscured by arms or objects during confrontations, but an officer’s gun is out front where it isn’t likely to be blocked. Marks says all 14 full-time officers and the department’s two reserves will use the new cameras. The gun-mounted cameras cost $500 apiece. Marks says they were paid for with forfeiture money and donations.\n\nKansas\n\nIndependence: A runner was killed by lightning as he was about to finish a 50-kilometer race in southeast Kansas. Organizers of the FlatRock race said in a Facebook post that 33-year-old Thomas Stanley, of Andover, was struck Saturday while competing in the race at the Elk City State Park, about 150 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. KSN-TV reports race director Carolyn Robinson says many runners and officials tried to give Stanley CPR and first-aid but were unsuccessful. Robinson says his wife was presented the medal he would have received. The couple had three children. His family described him in a statement as a “devoted husband, father, and friend.” Stanley worked for the nonprofit Kansas Leadership Center, which provides leadership training.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city’s zoo has spent thousands on a sinkhole about as wide as a football field, but it still hasn’t settled on a long-term plan for the problem. Louisville Zoo Director John Walczak says the zoo is weighing how best to handle the sinkhole, which opened in March in an undeveloped zoo section. Walczak says the zoo has spent about $125,000 on the sinkhole, which now sits about 60 yards wide, 90 yards long and 50 feet deep. Costs have included fencing, engineering, surveys and other responses. The sinkhole closed the zoo for 10 days and cost it thousands in revenue since then by shutting down a train ride. Walczak says it may cost $500,000 to move the popular ride.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s historically black university system has been selected to participate in a CIA recruitment program. The Southern University System has signed an agreement with the Central Intelligence Agency that sets up the framework for the workforce development effort. The agreement allows the CIA to work with Southern’s five campuses and their staff on classroom workshops, curriculum development and student recruitment activities. The agency also will do a campus advertising campaign. Southern says the recruitment effort is part of the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which is working with several colleges on the partnerships with the CIA.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Pine Tree State native who’s on the International Space Station says she wasted no time getting to work. Jessica Meir tweeted Tuesday that she was already conducting research within 36 hours of her arrival on the space station last week. She shared photos that were snapped Tuesday by a fellow astronaut of her third session observing crystals growing in microgravity. The Caribou, Maine, native was part of a multinational crew that includes a Russian and the first space traveler from the United Arab Emirates that blasted off last week. Meir served as a flight engineer and copilot of the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft. Meir will be working on experiments ranging from studying gravity’s effect on the human body to protein crystal growth to radiation’s effect on humans.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Parts of surveillance video showing the deadly attack inside a newspaper’s offices are so upsetting to watch that the recording would “unduly prejudice the jury,” a defense attorney told a judge Tuesday, while a prosecutor said the video is “the most important evidence in the case.” Elizabeth Palen, an attorney for Jarrod Ramos, focused on part of the recording that shows one of the five victims who died in the attack at the Capital Gazette newsroom trying to escape the newsroom after she was wounded. Palen described it as “inflammatory” and “inherently upsetting to watch” and said still photographs should be used instead. Anne Colt Leitess, the state’s attorney who is prosecuting the case, told Judge Laura Ripken she couldn’t think of any case law to suggest evidence should be “dumbed down and neutered.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Veterans Administration have announced plans to build a 53,000-square-foot veterans outpatient clinic on campus. The clinic in Worcester expected to open in 2021 will include 65 exam, consultation and procedure rooms; radiology, echocardiology, physical and occupational therapy facilities; a clinical lab; and a pharmacy. Ryan Lilly, director of the VA New England Healthcare System, says the announcement comes after years of hard work and planning to meet the needs of veterans in and around Worcester County. John Collins, chief executive officer and director of VA Central Western Massachusetts, says combining primary care and medical specialties in one facility will improve access and the coordination of care.\n\nMichigan\n\nAuburn Hills: Motorists traveling through this Detroit suburb were stunned to see a pornographic video playing on an electronic billboard. Auburn Hills police say the video played on the billboard along Interstate 75 in Oakland County for about 30 minutes Saturday night before the images were removed. Many people called 911. Chuck McMahon says he saw the video and wondered if the billboard was advertising for a strip club. Investigators tell WDIV-TV that two people apparently broke into a small building at the site and loaded porn on a laptop connected to the billboard. Two men wearing hooded sweatshirts were spotted on security video. Police are asking the public to help identify them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell: It took 9-year-old Kade Lovell longer than expected to finish his 5K race – but only because he was busy accidentally winning a separate 10K race. Lovell’s mother became worried when he didn’t cross the finish line of the Francis Franny Flyer 5K in Sartell on Sept. 21. She drove along the 5K route looking for him and was “bawling” when no one else saw him, either. Kade says a woman told him to keep going when he approached the 5K turn, so he did, despite his confusion. Race organizers told Kade’s mother he finished in first place, and she thought they meant in his age group. But he won first place overall. He finished in just over 48 minutes – a minute faster than the 40-year-old second-place contestant.\n\nMississippi\n\nCarrollton: Acclaimed guitarist and singer Taj Mahal is headlining a blues and gospel festival this weekend, and organizers say he chose the list of performers. The Mississippi John Hurt Homecoming Festival will be held Saturday and Sunday in Carroll County. Hurt was born in Mississippi in 1893 and started playing guitar as a child. He worked on farms and for the railroad and had a brief recording career before the Depression. He became famous in folk music circles a few years before he died in 1966. His granddaughter, Mary Frances Hurt-Wright, is president of the foundation organizing the festival. She tells the Greenwood Commonwealth that Mahal was 19 when he met her grandfather at a folk music festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Hurt became a mentor, teaching Mahal about the music business.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A videographer who collapsed from a heart attack in the visiting dugout at Busch Stadium is alive, thanks in part to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist. The videographer, 64-year-old Mike Flanary, was in the Chicago Cubs’ dugout Sunday before the game the Cardinals eventually won 9-0 to clinch the National League Central title. Flanary collapsed and was briefly without a pulse. The Post-Dispatch reports that baseball writer Derrick Goold had CPR training as a youth and rushed to help. The Cubs’ training staff and EMTs performed further medical procedures before Flanary was taken to a hospital. Flanary was in critical but stable condition. He had suffered a heart attack and a stroke. The stadium doctor on duty, David Tan, says Goold’s CPR “probably saved” Flanary’s life.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Officials say hemp is growing in popularity as a crop among farmers in the state. The Billings Gazette reports that statistics released by the Montana Department of Agriculture indicate 277 farmers are now licensed by the state to grow hemp. Department Director Ben Thomas estimates there are between 70 and 78 square miles on which hemp is being grown. Officials say Montana was growing hemp before the 2018 federal farm bill loosened regulations, and interest has grown since then. Officials say about 65 farmers attended a recent meeting of hemp growers, although only one had turned a profit so far. Farmers say they are interested in selling hemp and extracting oil from plants to sell in the growing market for CBD products.\n\nNebraska\n\nTerrytown: The City Council is considering barring anyone from feeding geese and other wild critters inside city limits. The western Nebraska council has scheduled a third and final reading and vote Thursday on a proposed ordinance. Violators would face fines of $5 for each offense, but court costs could raise the punishment nearer to $60. The proposed ordinance says feeding wild animals and waterfowl is detrimental to the animals as well as being a public health and safety hazard. Former Terrytown Mayor Kent Greenwalt has been feeding geese on the banks of Terry’s Lake for years, and he told the Scottsbluff Star-Herald the ordinance doesn’t make sense. He says it wouldn’t keep geese off the lake and wouldn’t keep people living around the lake from feeding them.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state has released a license plate honoring the victims and survivors on the two-year anniversary of a massacre at a music festival. The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles on Tuesday made available “Vegas Strong” charitable license plates. The plate has a black and gold heart-shaped logo and also says “Forever Strong.” Some of the money raised will go toward the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center. A sunrise memorial and an evening reading of victims’ names were among events held to mark the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting. A gunman in a high-rise hotel suite opened fire on a crowd attending the Route 91 music festival, killing 58 people. It is considered the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New limits are now in effect for a class of toxic chemicals in the state’s public drinking water supplies, representing some of the nation’s toughest standards. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the standards, which took effect Tuesday, require local water utilities to test for four types of the compounds known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances every quarter. If they find a level over the next year that’s above the state’s new limits, these utilities will have to switch to a different water source or develop costly treatment systems. The state Department of Environmental Services got $6 million in the new state budget to aid small systems in complying with the new law during this first year. Some towns are considering filing suit or refusing to comply without more funding.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Will the fourth time be the charm for the former Atlantic Club casino? The Boardwalk property, which has been shuttered since January 2014, has been sold to a New York firm. Florida real estate company TJM Properties announced Tuesday that it sold the former casino to investment and construction firm Colosseo Atlantic City. The purchase price was not revealed. TJM has been trying for years without success to sell the property – and make the deal stick. Three previous sales have fallen through. Company president Rocco Sebastiani says he plans to run the building as an 800-room, non-gambling hotel after conducting major renovations. The Atlantic Club formerly did business as Steve Wynn’s Golden Nugget before a series of ownership changes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAztec: A historian is leading a team to survey the historic inscriptions on the ceilings of 900-year-old ruins in northwestern New Mexico. Fred Blackburn and his team will study lengthy messages – or graffiti – left at the Aztec Ruins National Monument to shed light on how others saw the engineering marvel. Blackburn wants to know the stories of those folks and add historical context to their inscriptions in as many cases as possible. The Aztec Ruins National Monument is made of 400 masonry rooms and is an ancestral pueblo structure that dates back to the 11th to 13th centuries. White settlers named it after mistakenly believing it was built by Aztecs from central Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The project to rehabilitate a key subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn is on track to be finished even sooner than expected. Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said the L train renovation is now expected to be completed by April, a year after it started and ahead of the 15-month projection of how long it would take. The original plan to repair damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 called for a shutdown of the East River tunnel, but in January Cuomo called that off in favor of the current plan, which only requires work on nights and weekends. The L line is one of the city’s most crowded. There are about 400,000 rides daily, and more than half go through the tunnel.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: Several wild horses have been running free through the village because a hurricane and flooding have damaged their barrier island habitat. The Virginian-Pilot reports Hurricane Dorian and a subsequent rainstorm have damaged fencing and flooded areas where the animals are normally kept away from human contact. At least nine wild horses and a wild mule enter the Outer Banks village of Corolla each day. They are corralled and returned regularly to their remote beaches north of Corolla. The fence was built in the 1990s to keep wild horses out of the village and off N.C. 12 so they don’t get hit by vehicles. Corolla Wild Horse Fund chief operating officer Jo Langone says specialized equipment and skills will be needed to repair the fence.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An accidental gunshot at the Bismarck Gun Show caused quite a scare over the weekend, but no one was injured. Show officials tell KXMB-TV that the gunshot Saturday morning was an accident and that it’s unclear if a vendor or a customer was responsible. One vendor nearest to the incident was asked to leave the show. Show officials say this is the third time in 50 years of the event that a gun was accidentally discharged.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron: A sweat-stained jersey LeBron James wore while playing high school basketball and during his first Sports Illustrated magazine cover shoot as a teenager in 2002 is being auctioned. The online auction listing says the gold mesh jersey from the NBA star’s days with the St. Vincent-St. Mary Fighting Irish in Akron features green lettering with the word “Irish” and number 23, the same number he’d later wear for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Goldin Auctions says James gave the jersey to its current owner, an unidentified seller who attended the school. The auction house says 5% of the proceeds will go to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. The auction runs until Oct. 19. Early bidding reached $37,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Attorney General Mike Hunter is warning Oklahomans that a recent federal court ruling in Colorado doesn’t mean women may start going topless in public. Hunter released a statement Monday following a recent 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision regarding public nudity. The federal court has jurisdiction over federal cases from Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Hunter says the ruling was specific to a Colorado ordinance and doesn’t immediately invalidate other local and state laws. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by two women against Fort Collins over a city ordinance that prohibited women from going topless in public. The case helped fuel a Free the Nipple movement that has included displays of public nudity.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Portland Police Bureau spent $15.7 million on overtime in 2018. A report released Tuesday by the city auditor concluded the bureau needs to improve overtime management to prevent officer fatigue. The auditor said PPB could reduce the demand for overtime by using data and timely reports, placing limits on the amount of overtime officers can work and taking control of the time officers work on contracts for other employers. KOIN reports that data shows one patrol officer worked a 97-hour week at one point. In addition to his usual shifts, he picked up extra shifts to cover staff shortages, testified in court and did other overtime work.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A tax on beer sold at the state’s breweries and brewpubs is in effect, and some are passing along the higher cost to customers. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports the use tax of about 1.5% that began Tuesday is technically a tax on the brewer for using its own products at its business. One brewer tells the paper the tax will amount to about a dime on a $6 pint. The tax level is determined by multiplying a quarter of all retail sales by the local sales tax. The sales tax is 6% in most of the state but 7% in the Pittsburgh area and 8% in Philadelphia. That means the new tax is effectively 1.5%, 1.75% and 2%. A bill setting the tax rate was enacted in June.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has been awarded nearly $3.5 million in federal funding for addiction treatment. The state’s congressional delegation announced the grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s meant to increase the treatment capacity of Medicaid providers for substance use disorder treatment and recovery services. U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, says the funding will help ensure services are there when needed. Behavioral health providers will receive telemedicine services and technical assistance in billing and administration. The grant will also allow the state to recruit and train new providers. There were 314 overdose deaths in Rhode Island in 2018.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: Several dozen school bus drivers refused to run their routes after saying a newly consolidated school district cut their pay without notice. The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg reports about 50 drivers went to the Orangeburg County School District on Monday, saying they wouldn’t work until the dispute was settled. The school system canceled some routes just before school ended Monday, leaving hundreds of students stranded at school until parents or others could pick them up. The school system says it is now paying drivers for the actual time they work and not the anticipated time to finish a route. The change came after three districts consolidated over the summer. Bus driver Thomas Moorer says his paycheck went from at least $1,000 to $500.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBox Elder: The city attorney is being paid $100,000 to resign, but government officials are not disclosing the reason. The Rapid City Journal reports the Box Elder City Council approved the payment in July during a closed session. The newspaper says it tried for weeks to get a copy of the separation agreement between Box Elder and former City Attorney Kristi Vetri but received little more than meeting minutes, which don’t disclose the reasons why Box Elder paid Vetri to resign. Vetri, who did not respond to the newspaper’s request for comment, was Box Elder’s city attorney since April 2018.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Health is working to prevent the spread of rabies by raccoons through the distribution of vaccine packets coated with fishmeal. According to the department, the packets will be distributed by helicopter and airplane starting Thursday, through Oct. 20. The baiting program takes place in cooperation with the U.S. Agriculture Department along Tennessee’s borders with Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. The vaccine products are safe, but the USDA Wildlife Services program says residents should instruct children to leave bait alone. Baits also should be removed from where a pet could eat them. Using gloves or a towel, residents should toss them into a wooded or fencerow area. While there is no harm in touching undamaged baits, they have a strong fishmeal smell.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: The Texas History Center at Rosenberg Library has begun a project to make old news new again. The Galveston County Daily News reports archivists in late September began packing up and shipping bound copies of the Galveston Tribune to the University of North Texas in Denton. There, each page of the newspapers will be photographed and digitally preserved in the university’s Portal to Texas History, a free public archive that now contains more than 7 million Texas newspaper pages. The history center received a $25,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to begin the preservation project, says Lauren Martino, the library’s special collection manager. Founded in 1880, the Galveston Tribune was the city’s afternoon newspaper until 1963, when it was bought and combined by The Daily News.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park officials say an endangered California condor chick has left the nest and grown wings large enough to fly for the first time in park history. The southern Utah park said in a social media post last week that a group of visitors saw the baby condor stretch its wings and leave the nest Sept. 25. Park biologists later confirmed the sighting. The 4 1/ 2 -month-old chick is Zion’s first successful hatchling. At least two chicks have been born at the park, but they have died before they were old enough to fly. Park rangers have nicknamed the chick “1K” because its birth marked 1,000 condors hatched as part of a population recovery program. California condors are making a comeback in the wild three decades after nearing the brink of extinction.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A group at the University of Vermont is going to be helping the Federal Aviation Administration study the safe operation of drones during times of disaster. The university announced Monday that its Spatial Analysis Laboratory has joined the FAA. Spatial analysis lab director Jarlath O’Neil-Dunne says that during disasters, airspace can be crowded with drones – “from the fire department, state and federal agencies, the media, even the person down the street who wants to shoot a YouTube video.” So UVM will be working alongside 23 of the world’s leading research institutions and 100 industry and government partners to help the FAA conduct the research and testing necessary to make laws that keep the skies safe.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A new report suggests economic activity in the Hampton Roads region continues to grow and will accelerate further. The good news is part of the 2019 State of the Region Report released Tuesday by Old Dominion University. Each year, ODU’s Strome College of Business assesses the region’s economy. The growth stems in part from increased federal spending in the military-heavy region and a continued expansion of the coastal tourism industry. The report did not paint a perfect picture: Private-sector job creation lags similar metropolitan areas, and younger people are seeking jobs elsewhere. Another problem is a significant wage gap between men and women. The median income for women with bachelor’s degrees was 67.5% of that of men with the same education level.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Federal prosecutors say timber thieves were to blame for a fire in Olympic National Forest last year. An indictment unsealed Monday says Justin Wilke and Shawn Williams were trying to steal a big leaf maple tree in August 2018, but it had a bees’ nest. They decided to burn the nest with gasoline, then tried unsuccessfully to douse the fire with their water bottles. The ensuing blaze burned 3,300 acres of public land. Wilke was arrested Monday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said Williams is in custody in California. The indictment said Wilke previously sold stolen maple blocks to a Tumwater mill for $13,000, falsely representing that the wood came from private land. The wood is prized for making instruments.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State Health Department data reveals hepatitis C cases in Kanawha County have soared to the highest numbers in years, months after a program offering clean needles was suspended. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports more than 1,100 new chronic cases of the disease were recorded in the state’s largest county in 2018. Local clinic director Letitia Tierney says the area is nearing a hepatitis C outbreak and a potential HIV outbreak due to needle sharing. Officials didn’t immediately release HIV numbers. The county suspended its free needle exchange program in March 2018 after Charleston police said they’d enact tighter regulations. The program had been credited with helping reduce hepatitis C cases.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Wisconsin appeals court has ruled that operating a riding mower while drunk carries the same penalties as driving a car while intoxicated. The ruling Tuesday came in the case of a northern Wisconsin man who was arrested for drunken driving in 2017. Police pulled Keith Shoeder over while he was operating a riding mower on the streets of Rhinelander after leaving a tavern. Shoeder appealed his conviction of fourth offense drunken driving. Shoeder argued that the charge should be dismissed, contending that the riding mower was an all-terrain vehicle and not a motor vehicle and that therefore he was not subject to the same penalties. But the 3rd District Court of Appeals disagreed. It upheld an Oneida County Circuit Court ruling saying a riding mower is a motor – not an all-terrain – vehicle.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Officials say a federal Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in the city now bans smoking on its property. The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports the director of the Cheyenne Veterans Affairs Medical Center says the change that took effect Tuesday brings it in line with the policies of other VA medical centers and clinics. The Cheyenne facility is one of about 140 VA centers nationwide instituting the ban. The official says some veterans and employees are not happy about the ban, and administrators are trying to accommodate them. The center plans to offer smoking cessation options including nicotine replacement patches and over-the-counter medication. A facility nurse who works on employee health says workers trying to quit can take a free class to assist them.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/25/eagle-hacking-lunar-lab-vegan-disney-news-around-states/40199667/", "title": "Eagle hacking, lunar lab, vegan Disney: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Advocates for breastfeeding say employers in the state should do a better job of allowing the practice at work. At least 29 states have laws that protect breastfeeding and pumping breast milk at work – but Alabama is not among them, Al.com reports. The state has the third-lowest breastfeeding rate in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alabama mothers tend to quit breastfeeding sooner than women elsewhere, says Gayle Whatley, a registered nurse and vice chairwoman of the Alabama Breastfeeding Committee. She says that’s happening because of the lack of knowledge and support from their employers. Once women head back to work, that’s when breastfeeding rates “dramatically drop off,” Whatley says.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage School District has received a donation of high-end guitars that were bound for Hong Kong before they were confiscated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Anchorage Daily News reports the district estimates the 10 guitars have a combined value of nearly $54,500. The Fish and Wildlife Service says it intercepted the instruments in Anchorage in July 2018. The electric guitars had been commercially shipped from the East Coast and were declared as clothing. An official says the guitars feature Brazilian rosewood, which is protected by an international treaty and cannot be exported without permits. Fish and Wildlife officials began a civil forfeiture proceeding, and the guitar dealer who shipped them eventually gave up the instruments.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state senator plans to seek legislation that would prohibit city officials from earning more than the governor, officials say. Republican Sen. Paul Boyer said that would mean no employee could make more than Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s current $95,000 salary. Ducey’s salary is on the low end for governors; only the leaders of Colorado and Maine make less, according to the Council on State Governments. Even high-level municipal employees make more than the Arizona governor. Phoenix City Manager Ed Zuercher makes $315,000 annually, more than three times the amount the bill would limit, state officials say. Other cities outside Phoenix provide similarly high salaries for their top administrators, including city attorneys, public works directors, municipal judges, and long-tenured police and fire officials.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state and private groups are putting aside $2 million for conservation and water quality grants within the Buffalo River watershed. Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed an executive order Monday creating the Buffalo River Conservation Committee, which will be chaired by Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward. It will also include Secretary of Energy and Environment Becky Keogh; Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst; and Health Secretary Nathaniel Smith. Hutchinson said $1 million from his discretionary fund will go toward the water grants, with an additional $1 million from the Nature Conservancy and the Buffalo River Foundation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: As tensions between China and the United States ratchet up, former Gov. Jerry Brown sees a way to bring together the world’s largest carbon emitter and this state that’s leading the way in energy standards. Brown and Xie Zhenhua, China’s top climate official, announced on Monday a new university partnership focused on climate research and policy. The California-China Climate Institute will be housed at the University of California, Berkeley and work in partnership with Tsinghua University in Beijing. The institute will invest in research on zero-emission vehicles and low-carbon transportation, carbon pricing, climate adaptation, sustainable land use and agriculture, carbon capture and storage, and long-term climate policy enforcement. California has adopted some of the nation’s most aggressive climate goals.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded five airports in the state $7.6 million in infrastructure grants. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced in a Monday statement that the FAA grants are going to Denver International, Durango-La Plata County, Lake County, Pueblo Memorial and Wray Municipal airports. The FAA says DIA is getting $1.3 million to reduce aircraft emissions on the ground by connecting parked aircraft to central heating and cooling systems. Durango gets $1.8 million to repair an airport ramp. Lake County, in Leadville, will receive $600,000 to repair a ramp and build a parking lot, and Pueblo receives $3 million for perimeter fencing. Wray receives nearly $900,000 to build a taxiway.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: A wind sculpture in memory of three girls who died in a Christmas Day fire eight years ago has been dedicated. The Stamford Advocate reports the sculpture, called Three Souls, was unveiled Sunday during a ceremony attended by about 100 neighbors and friends. The sculpture has a large circle representing Lily Badger, who was 9 at the time of the Dec. 25, 2011, blaze, and two smaller circles for twins Grace and Sarah Badger, who were 7. It’s on land where the home once stood but was sold to neighbors Steve and Fern Loeb, whose son was friends with the girls. The girls’ grandparents, Lomar and Pauline Johnson, also died in the fire blamed on fireplace ashes that had been bagged and left in a mudroom.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: A horde of undead is expected to flood the streets of this unsuspecting town. News outlets report organizers of Milton’s zombie festival announced the event’s resurrection Monday, unveiling a new name and location. The new all-ages Milton Theatre Zombie Fest will take place Saturday, Oct. 19, in Dewey Beach. The original festival was killed in August, with organizers blaming town leaders for the loss of an event that nearly doubles Milton’s population each year. Organizer and theater director Fred Munzert previously said Milton leaders had approved new guidelines that essentially took the street festival off the street and upped the event’s financial burden. Munzert says the cancellation led 11 other Delaware towns to offer to host the growing festival.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Council is considering legislation that would bar people charged with violent offenses from claiming they acted in self-defense after learning the victim was gay or transgender. WTOP-FM reports Council Chairman Phil Mendelson introduced the “Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2019” last week, saying it’s unacceptable for “bigots to claim panic as a defense.” The bill would prohibit defendants from claiming they acted in the “heat of passion” or suffered reduced mental capacity upon learning about a person’s actual or perceived sexuality or gender identity. Mendelson was involved in helping the district legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s a vegan world after all, at least at Disney’s U.S. theme parks. Disney said Tuesday that plant-based meals would be available at all of its restaurants and quick-meal hubs at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Resort in California. The company says on its blog that the vegan meals will be available starting next week at the Florida resort’s parks and hotels and beginning next spring at the California resort. Visitors will be able to identify the dishes by a green-leaf icon on menus. Disney officials say guests have embraced vegan offerings on its menus around the globe, inspiring the company to offer more options. The vegan meals won’t have animal meat, dairy, eggs or honey. They will be made from vegetables, fruit, nuts, grains and legumes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: Authorities say oil from an overturned cargo ship has reached several parts of the state’s shoreline, leaving a sheen in marshes and oiled debris on beaches. State and federal authorities overseeing the cleanup say crews have been working to clean up the oil at Quarantine Beach in the Brunswick area, among other places. Authorities say more than 5,500 feet of oil-absorbent boom is being used to try to contain pollution from “sporadic discharges” from the South Korean ship Golden Ray. The vessel was carrying 4,200 vehicles when it capsized in the St. Simons Sound on Sept. 8. The ship’s pilot and 23 crew members were all safely rescued, including four men trapped for 36 hours before they could be extracted through a hole drilled into the hull.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A plan to minimize the effects of strobe lights on endangered seabirds will allow at least three Friday night football games on Kauai this fall. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami approved an agreement between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the County of Kauai. The plan will allow stadium lights during high school football games this Friday and Oct. 4. Officials say teams are required to play during the day from Sept. 15 to Dec. 15, when the island’s young seabirds take their first flights. Officials say the birds can mistake stadium lights for the moon and stars they use to navigate, causing them to fall from exhaustion after circling the lights. The agreement calls for monitoring and reporting downed seabirds during games.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: Twin Falls School District is offering a construction program for students in hopes of helping to fill a regional labor shortage. The Times-News reports the district in southern Idaho recently started the program, with high school students from the region traveling to a satellite facility to learn to build foundations, building frames, exteriors, siding and interior finishes. The district also plans to offer a second-year course that aims to move students onto a construction site to work directly with area employers. Teacher Cameron Hoge says the program will give students the skills they need to get a job in the trades.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state has issued about 300,000 driver’s licenses that are compliant with a 2005 law aimed at strengthening rules for identification at airports and federal facilities. The (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports that after long delays, the Illinois Secretary of State is now processing thousands of the documents daily. The licenses that are compliant with the REAL ID Act of 2005 have a small gold circle with a white star in the middle. Those applying for a REAL ID-compliant driver’s licenses need to show additional paperwork to prove their identity. Starting in October 2020, Illinois residents over 18 who fly or visit military bases will need a REAL ID-compliant document. Along with the new driver’s licenses, passports can also be used.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: The Indiana Dunes National Park saw its highest number of visitors this summer after receiving national park status. The 15,000-acre park along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in northwestern Indiana became the state’s first national park in February. The Chicago Tribune reports that the Indiana Dunes Visitor Center has tallied 131,662 visitors in the first eight months of 2019, breaking its all-time annual record. The park drew in over 42,000 July visitors, more than doubling totals from the same period last year. Park officials say the higher visitor numbers indicate the public has responded to the national park designation. The giant sand dunes were formed more than 10,000 years ago and reach almost 200 feet tall in some places.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: The West Des Moines Community School District has stopped a high school football team’s volunteer chaplain from praying with players before and after games. West Des Moines Superintendent Lisa Remy said Monday that the district received written concerns from parents that the prayers were a violation of the First Amendment. The district then asked the self-described chaplain, Chris Barr, to stop working with the Valley High School team while the concerns are reviewed by the district’s legal counsel. Barr did not pray with players Friday night when Valley played Waukee. He doesn’t work for the district but rather with West Des Moines Community Schools Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an independent organization that works with Christian students enrolled in West Des Moines schools.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Kansas’ newest state park is slated to open next month. Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park in Logan County is a rare geological gem that features chalky spires and buttes projecting as high as 100 feet in the air. The Wichita Eagle reports the park is set to open Oct. 12. The park’s grand opening ceremony will be followed by free, guided tours that run every hour. Kansas dropped a $50 visitor’s fee last month. The fee had been intended as a warning to anyone who might damage the park’s fragile rock formations. Tours will now be free, but visitors must schedule them in advance. Guests will be required to buy a $5 state park vehicle permit or have a yearly Kansas state parks vehicle pass.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Eagle populations in the state are growing rapidly thanks to deliberate hacking – the release of young eagles into the wild – over the past 33 years. Now, hacking isn’t necessary. Eagles are reproducing on their own at a sustainable rate. Kate Slankard, an avian biologist in the nongame branch for Kentucky Fish and Wildlife, calls the population uptick a “fantastic recovery” and “a good example of how the Endangered Species Act can work to recover a species.” This year, Slankard says, surveyors found 19 new territories – areas where eagles haven’t been recorded before – in eastern and central Kentucky. It’s the latest in a series of successes eagles have had in the state after a decline Slankard says was due to widespread use of the pesticide DDT.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A Tulane University professor has been chosen as this year’s winner of the Louisiana Writer Award, presented at the state’s annual book festival. Richard Campanella is being honored for his work documenting Louisiana’s history and culture. Campanella will receive the award, announced by the state library’s Louisiana Center for the Book, at the state book festival Nov. 2. Campanella, originally from Brooklyn, is a professor in Tulane’s School of Architecture. He says he was drawn to Louisiana when reading in 1971 about an Abraham Lincoln visit to New Orleans. Campanella’s books include “Bienville’s Dilemma: A Historical Geography of New Orleans” and “Geographies of New Orleans: Urban Fabrics Before the Storm.” Past recipients of the Louisiana Writer Award include Ernest Gaines and Elmore Leonard.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The largest cannabis conference in the Northeast is coming to Maine’s largest city next week. The New England Cannabis Network says the 5th Annual Maine Cannabis Convention will take place in Portland on Oct. 5-6. The event is expected to bring more than 150 exhibitors and more than 30 speakers to the state. The event is geared at people who work in the cannabis industry as well as growers and consumers. New England Cannabis Network says the convention “is designed specifically to help educate, promote, and develop state-wide cannabis resources and networking opportunities.” The keynote speaker at this year’s event is Shay Stewart-Bouley, a Maine-based writer. The event, taking place at Portland Sports Complex, is also the Northeast’s longest-running cannabis conference, according to organizers.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The University of Maryland has received a $200 million contract to research seasonal flu vaccines. The university’s School of Medicine says the research is aimed at testing vaccines and conducting controlled studies. The money is coming from the federal government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which hopes to develop a universal vaccine against new flu strains and to improve existing flu vaccines as well. The university say influenza affected more than 43 million people in the U.S. last flu season. The principal investigator for the research will be Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, a professor of medicine and pediatrics and director of the school’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. She’s considered one of the leading scientists for vaccine development and policy.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBurlington: Police officers briefly turned into Amazon drivers after a stash of undelivered packages was found in a cemetery. Burlington police tweeted that a “diligent groundskeeper” at a cemetery in the town northwest of Boston found the packages Monday morning in a trash receptacle and contacted police. Police did not say exactly how many packages there were, but photos posted on social media showed about 20. The packages were addressed to Burlington residents, so police took it upon themselves to deliver them. They are also investigating to determine how the packages ended up at the cemetery and have contacted Amazon. They tweeted, “If you see an officer delivering your packages say hello!”\n\nMichigan\n\nTemperance: An alligator rescued from a school pond is doing well in its new digs at a zoo. Staff from the Indian Creek Zoo in Lambertville on Friday captured the American alligator – originally believed to be a caiman – from a pond on the Bedford Junior High/High School campus in Temperance. It was discovered the day before in the pond used for academic study. Zoo employees have named the reptile “Renegade.” It’s about 3 feet long and believed to be roughly 3 years old. It was likely an illegal pet that escaped or was released. Zoo officials tell The Monroe News that Renegade will spend the fall and winter inside a heated barn and move into a new enclosure in the spring. Temperance is just north of Toledo, Ohio.\n\nMinnesota\n\nPipestone: The Pipestone National Monument says it will stop selling pipes following decades of tribal complaints that the sales desecrate sacred grounds. Minnesota Public Radio News reports Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux Tribe calls the southwestern Minnesota pipestone from which the pipes are carved “the blood of our people.” Superintendent Lauren Blacik says the monument’s leadership has come to understand that carrying a pipe is a deeply personal, cultural and spiritual responsibility. Native American craftspeople will continue to demonstrate pipestone carving and share their cultural history with visitors. And the Pipestone Indian Shrine Association, which operates the park’s store, says it will open a location downtown where such pipes may be sold. Spotted Eagle says the decision answers decades of prayer.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A businessman is pulling his $5.3 million donation, plus interest, from the University of Mississippi and giving the money to a nonprofit group that does community work and owns a newspaper. Ed Meek’s action comes months after the university removed his name from its School of Journalism and New Media after Meek commented on a Facebook photo of two young African American women wearing short dresses, suggesting they exemplified problems that threatened the Oxford economy. Meek later apologized. News outlets report Meek filed papers in July transferring his money to the CREATE Foundation, which owns the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. Meek tells the Daily Journal he was treated unfairly by the university and “roundly labeled as a racist.” Meek led Ole Miss public relations for 37 years, starting in 1964.\n\nMissouri\n\nJoplin: A sawed-off shotgun used by Bonnie and Clyde will remain in the city after being sold at auction. The Joplin Globe reports the weapon and other items related to the notorious criminal couple were auctioned Saturday in Boston. The Western Field Browning Model 30 shotgun was recovered after a 1933 gunfight in Joplin that killed two Missouri law officers. Bonnie and Clyde and their gang escaped. Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, says the shotgun sold for $68,750. He says the bidder wanted to remain anonymous but was determined to keep the weapon in Joplin. A Bulova wristwatch taken from Clyde Barrow’s body after his death in a 1934 gunfight sold for $112,500. And bidding on a book of poetry written by Bonnie Parker reached $25,000 before a cosigner withdrew it.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A conservation group trying to create the largest nature reserve in the Lower 48 is scaling back its request to expand bison grazing on public lands. The Associated Press obtained information about the decision by the American Prairie Reserve ahead of a public announcement. It follows opposition from ranchers who worry about being pushed out of the area. The Bozeman-based group is reducing the scope of its request from more than 450 square miles to about 94 square miles. Reserve Vice President Pete Geddes says the group doesn’t want neighboring landowners to feel “bulldozed.” The long-term goal remains unchanged: a 5,000-square-mile expanse of public and private with at least 10,000 bison. U.S. Bureau of Land Management spokesman Al Nash says the changes are under review.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state commission has approved spending an estimated $181,000 on emergency repairs to the Capitol’s gold-tiled dome. Bob Ripley, administrator for the Office of the Capitol Commission, says the work to protect the dome from moisture and winter’s freeze-thaw cycles likely will begin in mid-October. A July inspection discovered caulking applied to expansion joints in 2001 had deteriorated so much that water was getting inside the inner dome structure. Ripley says some tiles had been moved out of place, raising the risk they could fall off. Plans for the emergency repairs call for workers to rappel down the dome and temporarily seal the expansion joints to keep the tiles in place. Ripley says the longer-term solution will require scaffolding.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The off-Strip Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino is being sold. Caesars Entertainment Corp. announced Monday a deal with New York real estate group Imperial Companies worth $516.3million. Despite the sale, the 2,500-room Rio – home of the famed World Series of Poker – will likely remain much the same, and the 2020 poker tournament will be hosted there. Caesars will operate the property under a two-year lease agreement at $45 million a year. Imperial has the option to pay Caesars $7 million to extend the lease for a third term. When the lease expires, Caesars may manage the Rio or help the buyer transition to a new arrangement. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSomersworth: The mother of a middle school student says a teacher told her daughter to stop playing with her hair, then cut off 3 inches of it. Jillian Miglionico, of Somersworth, tells WMUR-TV the principal of Somersworth Middle School called her Monday after a teacher’s aide came forward. She said her daughter didn’t report the incident because she was scared and embarrassed. Miglionico said the teacher told her daughter to stop playing with her hair during class. When she didn’t, he said he’d cut it off – and did, using scissors. Miglionico said she wants to see the teacher removed. The Somersworth School District superintendent said his office is investigating and is taking the situation very seriously but can’t comment further.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The husband of a “Real Housewives of New Jersey” cast member will have to remain in jail while he awaits a final decision on whether he will be deported. A judge denied a request Friday by Joe Giudice to be released on bail. Giudice and his wife, Teresa, pleaded guilty in 2014 to financial fraud. Teresa Giudice served her sentence first and was released in December 2015. Joe Giudice has been held by immigration officials since he completed his 41-month prison term. A judge ruled in October that he would be deported to his native Italy upon completion of his prison sentence. Giudice has said he came to the U.S. as an infant and wasn’t aware he wasn’t an American citizen.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than a dozen pueblos are being awarded grants to expand and create library services. Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation say the pueblos will receive funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The money can be used to organize and preserve the historical records of Native American communities. U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan says the investment will bolster opportunities for exchanging knowledge, especially for students. Isleta Pueblo will receive nearly $150,000 to organize and translate historical records to ensure they can be used as a resource for future generations. The pueblo of Pojoaque will get more than $123,000 to preserve archival resources and to promote the Poeh Cultural Center Archives and Library. The funding will be used to hire additional employees and to buy equipment.\n\nNew York\n\nElmont: Work has begun on a $1.3 billion arena for the New York Islanders hockey team at Belmont Park. The 19,000-seat arena will also include shops, restaurants and a hotel. Work is expected to be completed in time for the 2021-2022 season. Until then, the Islanders will play home games at the Nassau Coliseum and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Dignitaries attending a groundbreaking Monday included Gov. Andrew Cuomo and actor and big-time Islanders fan Ralph Macchio. Cuomo says the project builds on two Long Island traditions: the Islanders and Belmont Park, home of racing’s Belmont Stakes. The arena is being built on state-owned property. As part of the work, developers have agreed to pay to build a new Long Island Rail Road station nearby.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCedar Island: A wild horse manager says more than half of one herd is thought to be dead after Hurricane Dorian’s storm surge slammed their island home. Manager Woody Hancock told McClatchy news that 28 of the 49 horses on Cedar Island, between the Outer Banks and the mainland, are suspected dead. He says the herd is lesser-known than the Corolla herd on the northernmost parts of the Outer Banks. That herd didn’t suffer any losses. He says 21 of Cedar Island’s horses survived, some managing to swim to safety. But dead horses have been washing up on beaches, while others remain missing. The horses normally migrate to higher ground during storms, but Hancock says they didn’t have time as a “mini tsunami” overwhelmed the island Sept. 6.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission plans to formally request that the flags of the state’s five tribes become a permanent fixture at the Capitol. The Bismarck Tribune reports that a committee of state lawmakers will hear the commission’s request Thursday. The commission’s executive director, Scott Davis, says he doesn’t anticipate there will be any opposition. Gov. Doug Burgum declared during his State of the State address in January that he would display the flags outside his office in Bismarck. They represent the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation; the Standing Rock Sioux; the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa; the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate; and the Spirit Lake Nation. Sen. Richard Marcellais, a former Turtle Mountain tribal official, previously proposed three failed bills to erect a display of tribal flags.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Parole Board has changed its approach to interviewing condemned inmates asking for mercy in a move that addresses a longtime criticism of the process. Under the old approach, board members would interview a death row inmate armed only with court records about the inmate’s case and the inmate’s disciplinary record while imprisoned. Under the new system, board members will have the inmate’s application for mercy, including information about upbringing, mental health history and rehabilitation while on death row. David Stebbins, a federal public defender overseeing capital punishment cases, says the goal is to provide the board with a more complete picture of the inmate before the interview. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the state public defender’s office back the changes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A local couple has been giving away free copies of the investigative report on Russia’s interference in Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election. The Department of Justice appointed special counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017 to investigate Trump’s campaign and Russia’s influence on the election. The probe’s findings, known as the Mueller report, were released in April. The report concluded there was no collusion with Russia but did not exonerate the president of a crime. Nick and Louise Brooke of Oklahoma City have disseminated more than 60 copies of the report since July. Nick Brooke tells the Oklahoman that although the investigation has been heavily reported, many people don’t understand what’s actually in it. The couple leaves the Mueller report in mailboxes along with voter registration forms.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After two wildfire-filled seasons, Oregonians got a break this summer. The state’s fire season was the mildest since 2004 and the least expensive since 2010, according to statistics from the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center. Statewide, wildfires burned just 67,795 acres this year compared to 883,405 acres a year ago. Cost also plummeted, dropping to $58 million this year compared to a record-high $530 million in 2018. One reason for the lack of wildfires was that Oregon’s forests never dried out to the level of the past two years, thanks to cooler temperatures and greater humidity, especially in the mountains.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The debate over guns has been revived in the Legislature, although Democrats say the process ignores their top priorities and could end up loosening gun laws. Tuesday marked the start of a two-day Senate committee hearing on gun violence and a slate of House committee votes on gun-related legislation. The action follows a burst of gun violence in Philadelphia and the wounding of six city police officers in a standoff. The Republican-controlled Legislature is historically protective of gun rights. The House committee unanimously advanced legislation to more swiftly take away guns from someone involuntarily committed for mental health treatment. Another bill it advanced would make it harder and more expensive for municipalities to defend their firearms ordinances against lawsuits, although that’s likely to draw Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s veto.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority says it is seeking public comment on a proposed digital fare structure. The Providence Journal reports riders will be able to transfer buses for free if they switch to the new digital payment system that RIPTA is expected to release this winter. RIPTA’s mobile app, named the Wave, will let riders pay for bus rides with their phones or fare cards using reloadable accounts. RIPTA is proposing a $5 fee to activate an account. The bus fare would continue to be $2, and riders would be charged $1 for every trip they take on Providence’s new Downtown Transit Connector route. Authority spokeswoman Barbara Polichetti says the changes show the agency’s interest in making it “much easier for the public to ride RIPTA.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFlorence: The county has declared every Oct. 3 “Heroes Day” to honor two police officers killed and five wounded in a shooting. Florence County Council approved the proclamation at its September meeting. The proclamation will be presented to the families of the slain officers at a ceremony planned for this Oct. 3 on the anniversary of the 2018 shooting. Florence Police Sgt. Terrence Carraway and Florence County Sheriff’s investigator Farrah “Maxine” Turner were killed when authorities say Frederick Hopkins ambushed officers coming to his home to talk to Hopkins’ son and serve a search warrant. Hopkins is charged with murder and is awaiting trial.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The state Supreme Court will once again hear oral arguments in Buffalo Chip’s quest to become a municipality. The popular motorcycle rally campground near Sturgis is appealing a February ruling that ordered the town of Buffalo Chip to be dissolved because it didn’t have enough residents when it was incorporated in 2015. The city of Sturgis has opposed Buffalo Chip’s incorporation for years. The Rapid City Journal reports that oral arguments are scheduled for Monday. Attorneys for the state have argued that Buffalo Chip was improperly formed because it had fewer than 100 legal residents or 30 voters at the time it was incorporated. Buffalo Chip officials have argued that the area had more than 30 voters.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee men have been killing Tennessee women at one of the highest rates in the nation for a decade, according to national data, and activists are calling for legislative change in response. The latest Violence Policy Center report finds that Tennessee ranked fifth in the nation for the rate of women killed by men after an analysis of 2017 data, a year where nearly 2,000 women were killed under those circumstances. “Women are most likely to be murdered with a gun wielded not by a stranger but by someone they know,” VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand said in a release about the study. Most of those homicides were committed with a firearm and often by an intimate partner of the woman killed, the data shows.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: NASA says the building where Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong and his colleagues emerged from quarantine after their 1969 moon mission has fallen into disrepair and will be demolished. The Houston Chronicle reports the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Johnson Space Center hasn’t been used for two years and will likely be torn down next year. The building, completed in 1967, was designed to isolate the astronauts and lunar rock samples until it was clear they weren’t carrying disease. A 2015 economic analysis determined that the historic building has structural and electrical problems and can’t be saved. A replacement building will house artifacts saved from original lab. NASA’s decision comes just months after celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the first lunar footsteps by Apollo 11 astronauts.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thousands of people in the state will be able to clear their old criminal records after a mass reduction of criminal charges by the top prosecutor in its largest county, a step that’s among the first of its kind in the country. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said Tuesday that he’s filing to reduce drug-related charges for more than 12,000 people. Gill says the move makes most of them eligible to expunge their records, which otherwise make it harder to get jobs, housing and education. It comes amid a national wave of criminal-justice reform. Miriam Krinsky with the group Fair and Just Prosecution says Salt Lake County’s effort goes further than many others by taking on a wide range of drug-related convictions, some dating back two decades.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State regulators have signed off on an ownership deal related to two utilities that critics worry could bring more fossil fuel infrastructure to Vermont. Vermont Public Radio reports the Public Utility Commission has approved the complex deal that will indirectly increase Canadian pipeline company Enbridge’s ownership over both Green Mountain Power and Vermont Gas. Julie Macuga, an activist with 350 Vermont, organized a protest Monday. She says the deal “is another case” where the state is heading toward a “fossil fuel monopoly and a consolidation of power.” Jim Porter of the Department of Public Service, which represents ratepayers, says the department concluded the deal will not have any significant impact on how the two utilities operate in Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Several University of Virginia students want to overturn a ban that prohibits sexually active gay and bisexual men from donating blood. The Daily Progress reports Austin Houck and others have banded together to create Homoglobin, a social welfare organization with branches at other schools including Virginia Tech and the College of William & Mary. The Food and Drug Administration instituted a lifetime donation ban on gay and bisexual men at the height of the AIDS epidemic in 1983. The policy was diluted in 2015 and now excludes donations from men who have had sex with men within 12 months. The agency considered ending the ban in 2016 after a mass shooting at a gay club in Florida but decided there wasn’t enough evidence supporting the change.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state has authorized the killing of some wolves in the Grouse Flats pack in an effort to stop the pack from preying on cattle. Kelly Susewind, director of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, on Tuesday authorized the incremental killing of members of the pack in southeastern Washington. The agency says the Grouse Flats pack has been involved in two cattle depredations in the past 30 days and four in the past 10 months. The agency says livestock producers in the area have taken nonlethal steps to stop the depredations, but without success. Under the incremental system, there is a period when some members of the pack are killed, followed by an evaluation period to see if the killings change the pack’s behavior.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: Vehicles exceeding the weight limit of a suspension bridge have led officials to close it indefinitely. News outlets report the Wheeling Suspension Bridge closed Tuesday morning and won’t be open to vehicular traffic for at least a year. Pedestrians can still walk or bike across. A charter bus weighing well over the weight limit caused the bridge to close for more than a month earlier this year. The bridge passed inspections, and officials added barriers and signs. The Friends of Wheeling organization says those changes haven’t stopped violators. Members recently observed over 100 vehicles weighing more than the 2-ton weight limit drive over the bridge. West Virginia Department of Transportation Acting District Engineer Joe Juszczak says the bridge will be closed until permanent repairs are made.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law group is challenging a Madison School District policy that prohibits school staff from telling parents if their child is transitioning genders at school, unless they have that student’s permission. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that the guidance document went into effect last school year. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty is asking that it be repealed. The group’s president, Rick Esenberg, says the policy instructs employees to deceive students’ families. Sherie Hohs, who oversees the district’s LGBT student support services, says outing students to families who may not accept their transition could have “devastating effects on their safety.” She says about 4% of Madison school students identified in a 2018 survey as transgender or nonbinary, or they rejected static gender identities altogether.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has received a $15.8 million National Science Foundation grant that will provide weather instrumentation and other equipment for a new research aircraft the university plans to purchase. UW is the only academic institution in the United States that provides a research aircraft facility to the atmospheric science community. The UW Board of Trustees is asking the State Loan and Investment Board for a loan for up to $4.7 million for the purchase of the aircraft. The university’s current King Air twin-engine turboprop is 42 years old.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/12/turtle-power-ditching-dixie-phd-age-news-around-states/49365831/", "title": "Turtle power, ditching Dixie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabamians can now get limited quantities of beer, wine and spirits delivered to their homes after the first companies have gotten licensed. Lawmakers this year approved separate bills to allow alcohol deliveries from retailers to a person’s home and to allow wineries to ship directly to consumers in the state. Several companies have gotten licensed to deliver the alcoholic beverages or to ship wine, according to the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The ABC Licensing Division has several other pending applications for both alcohol delivery and wine shipment, spokesman Daniel Dye wrote in an email. As of Monday, four companies have so far been licensed to deliver alcoholic beverages: Shipt, Dippi, Pick Up My Things and Deerfoot Spirits. Five companies have gotten licensed to ship wine directly to consumers in Alabama: Penrose Hill Winery, James Cole Winery, Winecub, Truth Teller and Robert Young. Alcohol delivery may not yet be available everywhere as companies ramp up operations. Shipt announced last week that it is doing same-day delivery of beer and wine from Target. The company said it is working to expand delivery from additional retailers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest airport saw a big jump in summer passengers compared to the 2020 season, when the pandemic kept many people at home. More than 877,000 passengers traveled through the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport between May and September this year compared to the same time last year, Anchorage television station KTUU reports. “The terminal was very busy this summer, so we knew it was going to be a good summer,” said Jim Szczesniak, the airport manager. Airport officials said those passengers injected more than $1 billion into Alaska’s economy. The travel group Visit Anchorage said hotel demand was up 47% over the same time period in 2020. “So we made some really encouraging gains, but we’re not back to where we were pre-pandemic,” Visit Anchorage Community Engagement Director Jack Bonney said. Both are cautiously optimistic for 2022. “I think as long as we stay on a positive course, we have a lot of really encouraging indicators for next year, but so much of this is tied up in national and global developments around the pandemic,” Bonney said. Szczesniak said he is hopeful the increase in passenger numbers will continue to climb with expanded cruises and international travel expected next year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A conservation group says an additional 1,850 acres of a cattle ranch that is part of an important wildlife corridor in western Cochise County are now protected as open space. With the additional acreage, a total of 3,800 acres of the Rain Valley Ranch are now protected through conservation easements, the Arizona Land and Water Trust announced Wednesday. The ranch along State Route 82 east of Sonoita includes part of a wildlife corridor that links the Whetstone, Mustang, and Huachuca mountains. “With large properties in the Sonoita/Elgin area continuing to be purchased for single-family homes or ‘ranchettes,’ the threat of development increases for locations like Rain Valley Ranch, making its conservation critical,” the trust said in a statement. The additional protected landscape also benefits nearby Fort Huachuca by ensuring that potential electromagnetic interference with military training activities associated with the Army base remains low, the trust said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A man who died in prison more than two decades ago is now being investigated as a person of interest in the disappearance of a girl who went missing in 1995, according to the FBI. The agency is asking the public for more information about Billy Jack Lincks, 75, who died in prison in 2000 and had been arrested for attempting to abduct a girl months after 6-year-old Morgan Nick went missing. Lincks was serving a sentence for a 1996 conviction for sexual indecency with a child at the time of his death. “Today, law enforcement may be closer than ever to identifying” Nick’s abductor, the FBI said in a news release. FBI spokesman Connor Hagan said this is the first time the bureau has publicly identified someone as a person of interest in Morgan’s disappearance. Arkansas’ missing child-alert system is named for Morgan. Hagan declined to say if investigators have any evidence connecting him to Nicks’ disappearance. Lincks was raised in Crawford County and returned to Van Buren in the 1970s after serving in the Army during World War II and working at Braniff Airlines in Dallas from 1962 to 1974, the FBI said. Lincks attempted to abduct a young girl in Van Buren at a location 8 miles from the baseball field where Morgan was taken, the FBI said, asking anyone with any information about Lincks to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state has begun positioning equipment and locking in contracts with temporary health care workers in preparation for another possible winter surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. The most populous state in the country still is doing comparatively well with the rest of the U.S. in terms of cases and hospitalizations. But Newsom warned Californians should prepare for another harsh pandemic winter even though the state is among the nation’s leaders on COVID-19 shots, with about 74% of eligible people having received at least one dose of a vaccine. While statewide hospitalizations have fallen by about half since a summer peak at the end of August, they have started creeping up in some areas, particularly the Central Valley and portions of Southern California including Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. “We’ve seen some signs that suggest concerns,” Newsom said. California earlier this fall had the nation’s lowest case rate but is now 16th, he said, while the positivity rate for those tested for the virus is 2.3% after falling below 1% in June. Beyond the upward trend in certain parts of the state, state health officials said they are generally apprehensive because colder weather will keep people inside. There will be more holiday mingling as immunity acquired months ago begins to wane without booster shots.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An appeals court panel on Wednesday reinstated a lawsuit filed by Republican lawmakers and a Colorado gun rights group challenging a “red flag” law that allows courts to order firearms taken away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. The lawsuit, filed in 2019, argues that majority Democrats in the state House denied Republican lawmakers their constitutional right to have the red flag legislation be read in its entirety during debate. The bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and took effect in 2020. When one GOP lawmaker requested a reading, multiple clerks read sections of the bill simultaneously, the plaintiffs said. A second representative’s request that the bill be read was denied, they said. Democrats countered that the bill was being read on the floor at the subsequent request of a Republican lawmaker until he withdrew that request. Colorado Politics reports that a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned a Denver district court judge’s ruling that the judiciary should not intrude on the prerogatives of the Legislature or other branches of government. The panel cited a Supreme Court ruling in an unrelated case that the courts can consider whether the Legislature has complied with the constitutional mandate for the reading of bills.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Mayor Justin Elicker appointed Renee Dominguez as the city’s police chief Wednesday, which would make her the first woman to permanently lead the force. Dominguez has served as acting chief since March, after the retirement of Otoniel Reyes. Her appointment must be approved by the city’s Board of Alders. City and state officials believe Dominguez also would be the first female permanent police chief in any of the state’s largest cities. Several women have led police departments in smaller cities and towns in Connecticut. In the state’s largest city, Bridgeport, Rebeca Garcia is currently the acting police chief. “I am very excited,” Dominguez said at a news conference Wednesday. “My entire adult life has been dedicated to serving the community.” Dominguez became a police officer in Newtown in 2000 and moved to the New Haven police force in 2002. She is married with two daughters, ages 3 and 6. “To be the chief and have little girls is a challenge,” she said. “But what better role model than your mother. You can do whatever you want, and you can be whoever you want to be.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Mourners shared laughter, memories and tears Wednesday as they paid their last respects to former Gov. Ruth Ann Minner. Minner, a sharecropper’s daughter, high school dropout and widow, was the only woman to serve as Delaware’s governor, holding office from 2001 to 2009. She died Thursday at the age of 86. Friends, family and fellow politicians, including President Joe Biden, paid tribute to her during a funeral at Milford Church of the Nazarene. They recalled her as a woman who was driven by steely determination but never forgot her humble upbringing and maintained a sense of empathy for fellow citizens. “Each time she climbed up the political ladder, she always stayed grounded in the lives of everyday people,” said Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades. During her decades of public service as a state lawmaker, lieutenant governor and governor, Minner served as a mentor and role model for many of those who attended her funeral. “Like many of you in this church, I would not be here today as your governor were it not for Ruth Ann Minner. It’s just that simple,” said Gov. John Carney, who served two terms as Minner’s lieutenant governor. “She set the standard for all of us.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s government has struck a deal with the U.S. Marshals Service to improve the situation at the city’s main jail after it came under criticism and the Justice Department announced that 400 federal prisoners would be transferred out because of substandard conditions. Conditions at the jail had long been a point of criticism for local activists. The issue took on a national political dimension in recent months because many defendants from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection were being held there. Wednesday’s announcement said the city Department of Corrections and the federal Marshals Service “will collaboratively assess conditions at the (Central Detention Facility) and develop a plan to address concerns.” Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement that she welcomed the attention and resources to “address any deficiencies” at D.C. facilities. “We all agree: everyone who is in our jail or under our supervised care should be treated humanely and have safe conditions,” Bowser said. Supporters of several Jan. 6 defendants filed suit, alleging the defendants’ civil rights were being abused at the jail. One of those cases led to a surprise Marshals Service inspection last month, which found unsanitary and abusive conditions, according to a damning report by Lamont J. Ruffin, the acting marshal for U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Biologists were taken by surprise by a record number of leatherback turtle nests found along some South Florida beaches this year. The 79 nests laid by endangered turtles along beaches in Broward County in the 2021 season is nearly double the previous record, the South Florida SunSentinel reports. The previous record was 46 in 2012, and the record low for leatherback nests was 12 in 2017. “It’s difficult to say why Broward County saw such an increase in leatherback nesting this season,” Stephanie Kedzuf, a biologist for Broward County who specializes in sea turtles, told the newspaper. Kedzuf said she will be curious to see whether other areas in the state saw a similar increase. Leatherbacks, named for their tough, rubbery skin, typically crawl onto beaches at night and dig holes to deposit their eggs in the sand. They are among the largest of sea turtles. The nesting season runs from March 1 to Oct. 31. During that time, coastal buildings must shield or lower their lights to prevent them from disturbing the hatchlings. When the turtles hatch, they race toward the sea to avoid crabs, birds and other predators. The lights can draw them inland, where they could be run over or trapped in storm drains. The leatherback population has declined by 40% worldwide, the National Marine Fisheries Service said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gun maker Remington Firearms will move its headquarters from the Empire State to the Peach State. The company announced Monday that it would invest $100 million in the factory and research operation in LaGrange, southwest of Atlanta, hiring 856 people over five years. It wasn’t clear what effect the transfer would have on Remington’s operations in New York and Tennessee. The company owns the parts of the former Remington Outdoor Co. that make rifles, shotguns and some handguns after the former parent auctioned its assets in pieces last year in a bankruptcy proceeding. Remington, the country’s oldest gun maker, began making flintlock rifles in 1816. It swelled into a firearms conglomerate but faced slumping sales, complaints about quality, and legal pressure over the Sandy Hook school massacre. The current company no longer makes the Bushmaster AR-15 rifles used to kill 20 first graders and six educators in the shooting in Connecticut in 2012. “We are very excited to come to Georgia, a state that not only welcomes business but enthusiastically supports and welcomes companies in the firearms industry,” Remington CEO Ken D’Arcy said in a statement. Gov. Brian Kemp famously pointed a shotgun at another person in a campaign commercial when the Republican was seeking his current office in 2018.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers in the state plan to strike later this month over wages and staffing concerns. UNITE HERE Local 5 said the strike due to begin Nov. 22 would affect 20 facilities across Hawaii. Thousands of Kaiser health care workers in California have already said they will strike starting Monday. Local 5 spokesperson Bryant de Venecia said Wednesday that negotiations were continuing. Kaiser and the Alliance of Health Care Unions began national bargaining in April. Local 5 has been negotiating some Hawaii-specific issues with Kaiser as well. Local 5 said in a news release that Kaiser’s latest proposal was for an “insulting” 2% wage increase contingent on the union’s agreement to a two-tier wage system under which new hires would receive lower pay. The union said Kaiser also failed to address concerns about short staffing, while workers report being stressed and overworked during the coronavirus pandemic. Arlene Peasnall, Kaiser’s senior vice president of human resources, said in a statement that Hawaii union-represented employees earn about 26% above the average market wage. She said Kaiser offered up to 4% yearly pay raises – 2% pay increases plus a 2% cash payout each year of a four-year contract. “The challenge we are trying to address in partnership with our unions is the increasingly unaffordable cost of healthcare. … Wages and benefits account for half of Kaiser Permanente’s operational costs,” she said, Hawaii News Now reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A northern Idaho mayor has announced he’s running for governor. Sandpoint Mayor Shelby Rognstad said Monday in Lewiston that he’s running as a Democrat to defeat first-term Republican Gov. Brad Little. The 47-year-old Rognstad said he’s running to break the lock Republicans have had on the state for 30 years. “For the better part of a generation, Idaho has effectively been a one-party state,” Rongstad said, the Lewiston Tribune reports. “There are no checks and balances, no compromise, no accountability. This is dangerous. The most extreme voices now go unopposed. Commonsense leadership has been replaced by authoritarianism and culture wars.” Democrats have not held the governor’s office since 1995 or statewide elected office since 2007. Only 12 of the 70 House members and seven of 35 senators are Democrats. The Idaho secretary of state’s website lists Rognstad as the second Democrat to join the race, after Melissa Sue Robinson, 70, a transgender woman who owned a construction company before shifting to a career in telecommunications. She lists adequately funding education as a top goal. The race also includes eight Republicans. Little hasn’t yet announced his reelection plans but is expected to run and has been fundraising. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin over Little.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A police oversight agency recommended suspension and in some cases potential termination for more than half a dozen officers following a botched 2019 raid on the home of a Black woman who wasn’t allowed to put on clothes before being handcuffed, according to a report released Wednesday. Earlier this year, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigated the wrongful raid on social worker Anjanette Young’s home, noted nearly 100 allegations of misconduct by about a dozen officers. The agency’s report recommended between one day and one year of suspension for multiple officers and “up to and including separation” from the department for some officers. Police Superintendent David Brown has already moved to terminate one sergeant. The raid “reveals problems far more pervasive than any individual incident of officer misconduct,” the report said. It also noted “other concerns, including lack of adequate training and supervision surrounding the Department’s use of search warrants and the disproportionate impact of police actions on people of color.” The botched raid, first reported by WBBM-TV, and the city’s handling of it prompted anger from clergy, lawmakers and civil rights activists who decried it as racist and an affront to a Black woman’s dignity.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Public schools should treat the Black Lives Matter movement as a political group, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said Thursday, potentially limiting the ability of schools and teachers to promote the BLM message in classrooms. “Black Lives Matter is unequivocally a political organization,” Rokita said in a news release Thursday morning. “Promoting or displaying some politically based materials while prohibiting the promotion or display of others could create a liability for schools and could violate the First Amendment.” Rokita issued an advisory opinion on how schools should treat BLM at the request of two state lawmakers amid concerns about the politicization of students’ education and what Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, called the “controversial ideology” of BLM. Rokita’s opinion comes after months of debate around the country about how and what schools should and should not be teaching, particularly with regard to race and racism in America’s history. Conservative groups have decried the teaching of critical race theory in the nation’s K-12 schools, which do not teach the academic framework used by legal scholars to examine the intersection of race and law in America. Still, activists and parents have latched onto the term.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A former Iowa State Patrol officer with a history of excessive force allegations has been indicted on a federal charge over a 2017 traffic stop in which dashcam video captured him roughing up a motorcyclist. A federal grand jury charged Robert James Smith last week with violating the motorcyclist’s civil rights by using unreasonable force during the stop near West Liberty, roughly 15 miles southeast of Iowa City. The indictment notes that the victim suffered “bodily injury” during the encounter, which means the charge could carry a maximum of 10 years in prison. Smith is set to make his initial appearance Tuesday at the federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids. Dashcam video shows Smith pulling over Bryce Yakish for speeding. The routine stop escalated immediately when Smith ran from his car with his gun drawn and pointed at Yakish, then 20 years old. Smith used his left hand to strike the face shield of Yakish’s helmet, knocking him backward onto his motorcycle and to the ground. Smith briefly put his knee on Yakish’s neck while handcuffing him. Yakish can be repeatedly heard in the video complaining of neck pain. Smith falsely accused Yakish of trying to flee and charged him with eluding law enforcement, even though he stopped immediately after Smith activated his lights and siren. That charge was dropped after a prosecutor reviewed the video and concluded it was baseless. Yakish lost his license because of the arrest, his motorcycle was impounded, and he spent the night in jail.\n\nKansas\n\nPeck: A 19-year-old is getting ready to graduate from Washburn University’s School of Law in Topeka. Braxton Moral’s parents have long known he was gifted. He skipped fourth grade and took his first undergraduate class at Harvard University while still in sixth grade. As he got older, he spent his summers at Cambridge. But when the school year started, he switched to online classes so he wouldn’t miss out on experiences like prom and homecoming at Ulysses High School. “He just wants to be like everybody else,” said his mother, Julie Moral. “He’s a blessing from God.” At Harvard, Braxton developed a love for government and realized he wanted to go to law school. But what should have taken three years he completed in two and a half. Next month, Braxton Moral will receive his juris doctor degree. In February, he will take the bar exam. “When I started out, it was more about just something fun to do,” Moral said. “And then you start off, you’re like, ‘Well, I just kind of want to get better now.’ So once you get a little bit of experience, it transfers from just fine to an actual goal.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has approved a request from Kentucky regulators to force West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to pay $2.9 million in fines for cleanup violations at some eastern Kentucky coal mines. The Tuesday order from Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate requires that the Justice companies finish reclamation work at the mines, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The order also allows the state to take posted bonds to cover the work. Kentucky officials called the violations at the Justice-owned mines “among the most egregious we have seen in nearly a decade” when the original agreement with Justice was struck back in 2014. Most of the sites are surface mines. The work includes cleaning out ponds, stabilizing land, improving drainage and reshaping the land to its original, pre-mining contours. Under the agreement with Kentucky, the West Virginia governor and his son, Jay Justice, are personally, jointly liable for the $2.9 million penalty. Jay Justice runs the company’s coal, timber and agriculture businesses. The Justices have argued that they have not been able to meet the deadlines because of the economic downturn and safety concerns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State government agencies lost more than 17% of their civil service employees in the last financial year. Byron Decoteau, director of Louisiana’s State Civil Service, said the turnover rate was nearly 2 percentage points higher in the 2020-21 budget year that ended June 30 than in the previous year. More than 6,000 civil service workers left state government in the latest year, including 21% who retired. Other employees were laid off, died, moved, left to go to school, got private-sector jobs or had other personal reasons, according to the report Decoteau presented to the commission that oversees the state workers who have civil service protection, called classified employees. The highest turnover rates were among prison guards at adult and youth prison facilities, the report showed – a consistent problem year after year. Decoteau noted that 10% of classified state employees currently are eligible to retire across agencies, while nearly 15% will be eligible to retire within five years. The data doesn’t cover political appointees across agencies or workers who transferred to other state government jobs.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: State park campers set another record this year. Maine is home to 48 state parks and historic sites, and attendance and camping at the parks have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Preliminary state figures showed Maine state campground attendance set a record for the second straight year, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state’s 12 state park campgrounds experienced an 8% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020, when campers set a record of more than 270,000. This year, the number grew to about 315,000. The state parks were heavily used before the pandemic, and the onset of the pandemic led to even more use as residents and visitors sought more outdoor forms of recreation. This year’s attendance was especially high even though July, in the heart of camping season, was full of rain. State officials said they expected 2022 to be another big year for the campgrounds.\n\nMaryland\n\nManchester: Five bald eagles were found acting strangely and seemingly sick in northern Maryland, prompting an investigation by state wildlife officials. William Fauntleroy found the birds Sunday in the Manchester area of Carroll County near the Pennsylvania border, The Washington Post reports. He said he saw an eagle near his mailbox that was acting weirdly and appeared to be unable to fly. The group of birds was feeding on a deer carcass, according to Fauntleroy. One died after flying into a power line. “I saw some were flying poorly,” Fauntleroy told the newspaper. “One seemed like it couldn’t get off the ground and couldn’t fly. It was acting like it was drunk.” Wildlife rescuers took the four other eagles to the Phoenix Wildlife Center in Baltimore County. Maryland Natural Resources Police spokesperson Lauren Moses said her department is “actively investigating” to figure out what happened to the birds, a federally protected species. The deer carcass the eagles ate was buried so no other wildlife would feed on it, according to Moses. She told the Post that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials were expected to take samples from the remains for analysis. “Was it poison? Was it an algae bloom? Was it something else?” the wildlife center said in a Facebook post Wednesday. “We don’t have answers yet.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Marine researchers in New England said Tuesday that they have collected data from tags that were surgically implanted in sea turtles for the first time. Scientists with the New England Aquarium who performed the work said it could lead to improvements in the way researchers monitor threatened species of turtles. The loggerheads were rehabilitated at the Boston-based aquarium’s turtle hospital and released earlier this year with the acoustic tags implanted in their bodies. Acoustic receivers in Nantucket Sound off Massachusetts showed multiple detections earlier this month, the researchers said. Scientists have long used turtle tagging to monitor the animals, but the tags have previously been placed on their shells using an epoxy. Kara Dodge, a research scientist with the aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said the new tagging method will make it easier to monitor injured turtles that are released back into the wild after rehab. The tags allow scientists to “assess rehabilitated turtles’ survivorship over time and resumption of normal behaviors in the wild,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Wednesday approved a $626 million deal to settle lawsuits filed by Flint residents who found their tap water contaminated by lead following disastrous decisions to switch the city’s water source and a failure to swiftly acknowledge the problem. Most of the money – $600 million – is coming from the state of Michigan, which was accused of repeatedly overlooking the risks of using the Flint River without properly treating the water. “The settlement reached here is a remarkable achievement for many reasons, not the least of which is that it sets forth a comprehensive compensation program and timeline that is consistent for every qualifying participant,” U.S. District Judge Judith Levy said in a 178-page opinion. Attorneys are seeking as much as $200 million in legal fees from the overall settlement. Levy left that issue for another day. The deal makes money available to Flint children who were exposed to the water, adults who can show an injury, certain business owners and anyone who paid water bills. About 80% of what’s left after legal fees is earmarked for children. “This is a historic and momentous day for the residents of Flint, who will finally begin to see justice served,” said Ted Leopold, one of the lead attorneys in the litigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 hospitalizations have reached their highest level of the year in the state, and hospital capacity continues to tighten amid an alarming surge in cases, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Wednesday. The Minnesota Department of Health on Wednesday reported 5,277 new coronavirus cases and 43 new deaths, raising the state’s pandemic totals to 831,669 confirmed cases and 8,925 deaths. Minnesota hospitals were caring for 1,159 COVID-19 patients, including 257 in intensive care units. Malcolm called the new case and death numbers “extraordinarily high and concerning” and said that “right now we find ourselves in a really truly alarming spike” in new cases. “Every day now we’re seeing dozens of Minnesotans dying from an illness that they didn’t have to get, and that is beyond heartbreaking for all of us doing this work,” Malcolm said. “The tragedy of this current spike in cases is that more than ever, we have the tools and the knowledge to minimize the impact of this virus.” Those tools include vaccinations, masking in public and staying home when sick, she said. Most Minnesotans are vaccinated, but too many still aren’t, she said. And Kris Ehresmann, the department’s infectious disease director, said the problem of “waning immunity,” which appears to show up around six months after vaccination, seems to be a factor in the rise of breakthrough cases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has finished repairing section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, and the road reopened Wednesday. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged, one after another, into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital Sept. 11. The Mississippi Department of Transportation awarded a $1.8 million repair contract in October. A construction company met the department’s goal of getting the highway back open safely and quickly, southern district Transportation Commissioner Tom King said in a news release Wednesday. “I know how important Highway 26 is for the region, and I appreciate all the work that went into getting it open ahead of schedule,” King said. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislators in September that the area had already received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than one day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed. King said work will continue until early 2022 as crews repave routes that had been used as detours amid the closure.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Security camera footage, shell casings, and a small but distinctive tattoo played pivotal roles in the arrest of a man suspected in at least six killings over the past two months in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s office on Tuesday charged Perez Deshay Reed in the shooting deaths of two people in the city in September. Reed was charged Saturday in two other fatal shootings in September in St. Louis County. He is also suspected of killing two people in Kansas City, Kansas, and the FBI has labeled him a suspected serial killer. Reed, who turned 26 on Wednesday, remained jailed on $2 million bond Tuesday. Surveillance video in Kansas helped lead to Reed’s arrest. Images captured by the cameras showed the distinctive crescent moon-shaped tattoo on Reed’s forehead. Another key factor was evidence left behind at each of the St. Louis-area shootings. “The commonality among them were handgun casings,” said Rich Quinn, special agent in charge of the FBI office in St. Louis. “We knew they came from the same handgun.” Reed is charged in the St. Louis County killings of 16-year-old Marnay Haynes on Sept. 13 and 40-year-old Lester Robinson on Sept. 26. In the city of St. Louis, he is suspected in the killings of 49-year-old Pamela Abercrombie on Sept. 16 and a 24-year-old man, Carey Ross, on Sept. 19. All four victims were shot in the head.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Tribes and conservation groups sued state environmental regulators Wednesday after Gov. Greg Gianforte’s administration dropped a legal claim against a mining executive over decades of pollution from several mines. The lawsuit was filed in state district court in Lewis and Clark County by attorneys for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, the Montana Environmental Information Center and other groups. Under Gianforte, the Department of Environmental Quality in July quit a legal action that sought to block Idaho-based Hecla Mining Co. and its president, Phillips Baker Jr., from involvement in two proposed silver and copper mines. Baker was an executive with Pegasus Gold, which went bankrupt in 1998, leaving state and federal agencies with more than $50 million in cleanup costs at several mines, including the Zortman and Landusky mines near the Fort Belknap reservation. A state “bad actor” law enacted in the wake of the Pegasus bankruptcy punishes companies and their executives who don’t clean up mining pollution. Under the law, companies and their senior leaders can’t receive new mining permits until they’ve reimbursed the state for past cleanup costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A coalition that includes labor unions and civil rights groups has launched a website and social media pages in its drive to get a measure to raise Nebraska’s minimum wage to $15 an hour on the ballot next year. Raise the Wage Nebraska says it wants to highlight the stories of the 195,000 Nebraska residents who’d see higher pay, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The coalition needs to collect 87,000 signatures on petitions by July 2022 to get its proposal on the ballot in November 2022. The measure would increase the minimum wage by $1.50 annually until it reached $15 in 2026. After that, there’d be an annual cost-of-living increase. Nebraska voters widely supported raising the minimum wage in 2014. Nearly 60% backed an initiative that increased it from $7.25 an hour to its current $9 an hour. Business groups oppose the measure, saying it could hurt small-business owners who already are having difficulty filling jobs as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also is opposed. But supporters said raising the wage will help people living in poverty and working multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Legislature is finally set to start redrawing the state’s political maps. Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Thursday that lawmakers would convene for a long-delayed special session focused on redistricting at 1 p.m. Friday. Sisolak said in a statement that he was looking forward to “an efficient and productive session” that will fulfill the Silver State’s constitutional duty to revise every federal, state and local voting district after each census. The redistricting process is controlled by whichever political party holds the Legislature, often resulting in districts that favor one party over the other, a process known as gerrymandering. Bitter battles over this practice happen often in Carson City, where a court-appointed panel had to finish drawing boundaries on which politicians couldn’t agree in 2011. The undertaking was almost equally toxic in 2001, when there were also legal challenges, then a special session called after remapping efforts repeatedly stalled in a split partisan Legislature. Draft maps debuted Tuesday point to the possibility of a more harmonious redistricting session in 2021, though Republicans are likely to take issue with proposed changes that could make the state’s two battleground congressional districts more Democratic-leaning over the next decade.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: After rejecting millions of dollars to help increase the state’s vaccination rate, the Executive Council on Wednesday reversed course and approved $22 million for the effort, along with a nonbinding resolution that condemns vaccine mandates. Last month, the Republican-led council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts, rejected $27 million in federal vaccination funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. The language the Republicans opposed has appeared in other contracts they approved, and both Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General John Formella said it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty. Later in October, the council voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. With the approval of Wednesday’s funds, that money will now be repurposed. “We are moving full steam ahead,” Sununu said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Garden State businesses owned by people of color were more likely to lose money during the early months of the pandemic and less likely have access to the credit they needed to make up for it, according to a study released Wednesday. The report showed Black- and Latino-owned business were at a particular disadvantage when it came to the government’s main emergency finance plan, the Paycheck Protection Program, forcing them to rely on their own savings to survive. “It was a bit of a worry; it was a bit of a panic attack,” said Tashianna Gayle, 34, owner of Hair Haven, a salon in Asbury Park. She was told she didn’t qualify for a PPP loan because she had only been open for a month before the pandemic hit. The report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority was designed to look at how racial disparities during the pandemic’s economic crisis played out among small businesses in the state. “It’s discouraging and, sadly, not surprising that the pandemic hit Black- and Latino- owned businesses especially hard,” said Tim Sullivan, the New Jersey EDA’s chief executive officer. The agency rolled out a low-interest micro-loan program Wednesday that aims to address the disparity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Two of the state’s largest hospitals announced Thursday that they would be focusing on patients who need care the most, meaning procedures that aren’t medically necessary will likely have to be delayed. While most patients are not dealing with coronavirus infections, officials at Presbyterian Healthcare Services and University of New Mexico Health say the ability to grow the capacity that was built over the past year due to the pandemic is now limited by space and the availability of health care workers. The two hospitals announced they were activating crisis standards of care, noting that it’s not really a shift in policy but rather a continuation of how they have been managing the crush of patients since last winter. “It’s really important to recognize we are not deallocating care. That is not part of this. We are not triaging and denying care,” said Dr. Jason Mitchell, Presbyterian’s chief medical officer. “At this point we are trying to make sure that every patient has care in a bed across our state and even in surrounding states.” He saud the decision will not be to take a patient off a ventilator, for example, but rather to find other hospitals within New Mexico or in neighboring states that can take patients or directing patients with less severe issues to urgent care clinics or other providers.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Six state correctional facilities will close next March in a cost-saving move amid declining inmate populations, officials announced Monday. More than 1,700 people work at the six upstate New York facilities, which house more than 1,400 inmates. The inmates will be sent to other locations, and no layoffs are expected from the closures, which are projected to save $142 million, according to the release from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The corrections agency said it will work with unions to provide staffers with transfer opportunities to other facilities or to other state agencies. The facilities set for closure March 10 are Ogdensburg Correctional Facility, Moriah Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility, Willard Drug Treatment Campus, Southport Correctional Facility, Downstate Correctional Facility and Rochester Correctional Facility. The governor was authorized by the Legislature this year to close state prisons amid a long-term drop in inmates. There are currently 31,469 inmates in state correctional facilities, down from a systemwide high of 72,773 in 1999. The agency said officials looked at multiple factors before making the decision, including physical infrastructure, program offerings, facility security level, proximity to other facilities and health services.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A trial judge on Wednesday ordered the state to pay out $1.75 billion to help narrow public education inequities, angering Republicans who said the directive usurps lawmakers’ constitutional authority over state coffers. Superior Court Judge David Lee, who is charged with overseeing corrective responses related to school funding litigation that began over a quarter-century ago, said the legislative and executive branches have been afforded every courtesy over the years to act decisively. But “this court’s deference is at an end at this point,” he said. The judge’s action likely will set up a constitutional showdown among the three government branches. Lee said his order wouldn’t take effect for 30 days, giving GOP leaders at the Legislature or others time for a legal challenge, which is likely. Republicans say that only the General Assembly can appropriate funds in state accounts and that Lee is violating the state constitution if he acts contrary to that. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2004 in the Leandro lawsuit – named after an early student plaintiff – that while North Carolina’s children have a fundamental right to the “opportunity to receive a sound basic education” under the constitution, the state had not lived up to that mandate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A storm system that is expected to bring snow to the state late this week could help improve persistent long-term drought conditions. Forecasters are expecting 2 inches to 4 inches of snow in the eastern half of the state, with up to 6 inches in the northeastern corner of North Dakota. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph are expected along with the snow, potentially making travel difficult, according to forecasters. Drought conditions that brought hardships for ranchers and farmers this summer have made marked improvement. In eastern North Dakota in recent weeks, much of the region is no longer listed in any of the four drought categories, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Much of the central and west regions remain in severe or extreme drought, but even those areas have improved dramatically from last summer. There is no change in this week’s U.S. Drought Monitor map, which is updated every Thursday. “In the Dakotas, where long-term drought is still ongoing, livestock water quality and (mule deer) fawn production were both reported to be suffering as a result of the drought,” wrote National Drought Mitigation Center Climatologist Curtis Riganti. Harvest is mostly wrapped up in North Dakota, though about one-fifth of the corn crop and one-third of the sunflowers remain in fields.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A polar bear who was a fixture at the Toledo Zoo for more than two decades has died due to kidney disease. Michael Frushour, the zoo’s curator of mammals, told The Toledo Blade that the bear named Marty was euthanized Nov. 4, less than a month shy of his 25th birthday, Marty had been diagnosed a couple of years ago with what Frushour described as “age-related kidney disease.” Zoo officials had recently noticed that Marty wasn’t eating as much as usual and had become less active. An examination determined his kidneys were functioning very poorly, so they decided to have him euthanized. Marty was born in late 1996 and came to the Toledo Zoo from Chicago in 1999. In 2007, he went to the Pittsburgh Zoo for a year before he returned to Toledo. Marty and the Toledo Zoo’s female polar bear, Crystal, had several cubs together, and zoo officials believe Crystal – who turns 23 this week – may be pregnant again. The zoo hopes to replace Marty with another male polar bear, though it’s not yet clear when that might happen.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday directed the State Department of Health to stop issuing birth certificates listing a nonbinary option instead of designating a gender, despite a settlement agreement in a civil case in which the agency agreed to do so. The first-term Republican said in his order that his administration never reviewed or approved the settlement agreement, which requires the Oklahoma State Department of Health to amend birth certificates in a manner not permitted under Oklahoma law. The order directs the department to cease amending birth certificates in any way not specifically authorized under state law and to remove from its website any reference to amending birth certificates for nonbinary people. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments. Stitt also directed the Legislature to pass legislation when it returns next year to specifically prohibit the issuance of birth certificates with nonbinary designations. Freedom Oklahoma, which advocates for nonbinary and LGBTQ people, said in a statement that while the state is facing scrutiny over how it carries out executions, “it felt easy for the governor to try and refocus media narratives and partisan pressure by attacking some of the most marginalized and historically excluded residents of our state.” Nichole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said the governor does not have the authority to overturn an agreement entered into in a court of law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A school board that recently banned teachers from displaying symbols including those supporting gay pride and Black Lives Matter has abruptly fired the superintendent, deeply upsetting members who opposed the move. The escalating disputes in the Newberg School Board come as schools nationwide have become battlegrounds, with arguments over vaccine and mask mandates, how racism is addressed in teaching, instruction related to sexuality and gender-neutral bathrooms. After Superintendent Joe Morelock was fired in a Zoom meeting late Tuesday night, board member Brandy Penner said Wednesday she believes the conservative board members fired Morelock because he didn’t aggressively implement their ban on controversial symbols, adding that the policy didn’t define what symbols would be unacceptable. Rebecca Piros – one of three who opposed his firing – told Morelock she was sorry. Morelock replied: “Just remember that from the darkest dark comes the brightest light, so everything will work out eventually.” Piros broke down in tears when she heard those words. On Wednesday, some residents of Newberg, a town of 23,000 about 25 miles southwest of Portland, erected signs quoting Morelock’s reply to Piros. Newberg Equity in Education, a group composed mostly of parents who oppose the school board’s recent rightward tilt, planned a demonstration Thursday at the school district office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Justice was not blind when a lawyer dropped his pants after repeatedly setting off a metal detector at a courthouse. Jeffrey Pollock, 59, was trying to pass through security outside family court Wednesday, but the machine kept sounding an alarm, authorities said. The lawyer told guards his suspenders were causing the alerts, and he could not remove them. The guards asked him to keep trying until the alerts stopped. “After a heated discussion with the guards, Pollock unhooked his suspenders, dropped his drawers, took them off, and placed them in the bin to go through the metal detector,” the Allegheny Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Authorities said Pollock stood in his shirt and underwear. He was charged with disorderly conduct. “I used poor judgment,” Pollock told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “I was trying to make a point.” The sheriff’s office noted “that visible underwear is not part of the dress code.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: An 89-year-old has achieved a goal he spent two decades working toward and nearly a lifetime thinking about: earning his Ph.D. and becoming a physicist. Manfred Steiner recently defended his dissertation successfully at Brown University. Steiner said he cherishes this degree because it’s what he always wanted – and because he overcame health problems that could have derailed his studies. “But I made it, and this was the most gratifying point in my life, to finish it,” he said Wednesday at his home in East Providence. As a teenager in Vienna, Steiner was inspired to become a physicist after reading about Albert Einstein and Max Planck. He admired the precision of physics. But after World War II, his mother and uncle advised him that studying medicine would be a better choice in turbulent times. He earned his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1955 and moved just a few weeks later to the United States, where he had a successful career studying blood and blood disorders. Steiner studied hematology at Tufts University and biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before becoming a hematologist at Brown University. He became a full professor and led the hematology section of the medical school at Brown from 1985 to 1994.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The amount of money in state bank accounts continues to grow thanks to a quick recovery from the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and people spending money much faster than experts predicted. The latest estimate released Wednesday said South Carolina lawmakers will have nearly $1 billion more to spend this budget year, according to the state Board of Economic Advisers. That boosts the money over which the General Assembly has control to nearly $11 billion and doesn’t count the roughly $3 billion in federal COVID-19 relief money coming to South Carolina. It also doesn’t count about a $1 billion surplus after the state closed the books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. Predictions that economic growth would slow because of supply chain issues, consumers slowing their spending or dwindling federal stimulus money didn’t come true. The 13.2% growth in the 2020-21 fiscal year budget was the largest in at least 40 years, the board said. South Carolina sales tax collections continue to soar, growing by $500 million to $3.8 billion in the past fiscal year. Corporate tax revenues have also risen sharply thanks to retailers benefiting from all that extra money being spent. The state’s economic experts still think the rapid rise in revenue can’t continue.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Only 45% of educators are teaching required standards on Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings, according to a new survey by the South Dakota Department of Education. OSEUs are basic understandings of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota culture and history. The standards were approved by the Board of Education Standards in 2018, which should make them required for all K-12 students, but DOE officials have said in the past that they were unsure how broadly OSEUs were used and that they weren’t required. Lawmakers have drafted bills to make sure OSEUs were required, but such a bill was shot down in the 2021 session. News of survey results comes months after it was revealed the DOE removed more than a dozen explicit references to the Oceti Sakowin from a draft of social studies standards before they were released to the public. That issue caused state-level protests and outcries from residents and educators. Weeks later, Gov. Kristi Noem ordered the DOE to restart the standards revision process to include more input from stakeholders, including Native Americans. But educators and Indigenous education advocates are still calling on Noem and other top education officials to resign after their mishandling of the social studies standards process.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery producing Jack Daniel’s whiskey is teaming with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. More than 1,700 service members and relatives will head home through “Operation Ride Home,” organizers said. That’s the most participants in program history. In its 11th year, the program provides financial assistance to active-duty, junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel to loved ones’ homes nationwide. The Jack Daniel Distillery teams with the Armed Services YMCA to offer the assistance. Service members from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have been assisted with travel to every state. “We are absolutely thrilled they’ll get to reunite with their loved ones this year,” said Chris Fletcher, Jack Daniel’s master distiller. “Providing some financial assistance to see that they make it home is the least we can do.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An 18-year-old man has been arrested and charged with arson for a fire at a synagogue, officials said. Franklin Barrett Sechriest was held on a $100,000 bond for the Oct. 31 fire at Congregation Beth Israel, KVUE-TV in Austin reports. According to the Austin Fire Department, the fire was a “small exterior fire” that caused no injuries but resulted in an estimated $25,000 damage, including the synagogue’s wooden doors. Arson investigators said broken glass indicated an item might have been thrown at the building, and a flammable liquid accelerated the fire. An arrest affidavit describes surveillance videos from multiple cameras on the property showing a suspect resembling Sechriest driving a black sport utility vehicle registered to a woman living at the same address as Sechriest. The fire at the synagogue came a week after a string of antisemitic incidents, including an antisemitic banner displayed from an overpass on a heavily traveled boulevard. It was not immediately clear if the fire was connected to those incidents.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Southern Utah’s Dixie State University is poised to change a name often associated with the Deep South and slavery after the Legislature approved a new name Wednesday over local backlash. The Republican-controlled Legislature voted to change the name to Utah Tech University after multiple executives from the burgeoning tech sector said the Dixie name is often met with confusion and distaste as the institution grows. GOP Gov. Spencer Cox is expected to sign the bill. The term got new scrutiny following a national outcry against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. “This process is not about cancel culture. No one is trying to erase the great history of this beloved institution,” said Republican Rep. Kelly Miles, who sponsored the name-change bill. “We as Utahns pride ourselves in our forward thinking … it just makes sense that our students in this great state will be better served by the name Utah Tech University.” A compromise provision will keep the name Dixie on the main campus in St. George, a city near the Arizona border that’s among the fastest-growing in the country.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: A federal grant will go toward helping the state to educate more nurses. Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College announced Wednesday that the $240,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce would be used to expand Vermont Technical College’s existing nursing program at Northern Vermont’s University’s Lyndon campus. Vail Hall on the Lyndon campus will be transformed into the Clinical Nursing Education Center, complete with a nursing instruction classroom and skills and simulation lab spaces. “Addressing Vermont’s nursing workforce challenge requires increasing opportunities for Vermonters to pursue careers in nursing,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said in a statement. Officials say the number of new registered nurses in Vermont declined 69% from 2007 to 2014. It’s estimated that Vermont needs 900 skilled nurses per year. In 2019, 421 completed licensed practical nurse or RN programs.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: President Joe Biden saluted the nation’s military veterans as “the spine of America” on Thursday as he marked his first Veterans Day as president in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. “There’s nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it,” said Biden, whose administration earlier in the day announced a federal effort to better understand, identify and treat medical conditions suffered by troops deployed to toxic environments. Earlier in the week, members of the Chief Plenty Coups Honor Guard from Pryor, Montana, placed flowers in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and saluted the unknowns. Dozens more Crow Nation representatives, including students from Plenty Coups High School, followed suit Tuesday morning – the first time in 96 years the public and visitors had been allowed to approach the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It’s a privilege typically reserved for the sentinels of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, “The Old Guard,” according to the Arlington Cemetery. The flower ceremony kicked off a two-day centennial commemoration event. The dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier took place Nov. 11, 1921, according to the National Archives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak Cascades will resume service Nov. 18 on the Point Defiance bypass between Tacoma and Olympia, nearly four years after a deadly derailment there. The first train to use the bypass is scheduled to leave Seattle at 7:22 a.m. and arrive at the new Tacoma Dome station at 8:08 a.m., according to an Amtrak statement. The first northbound train will leave Eugene, Oregon, at 5:30 a.m., stop in Portland and arrive in Tacoma at 10:54 a.m., The Seattle Times reports. Amtrak said eight trains – including Amtrak Cascades and Coast Starlight – will use the bypass daily, with additional trains added as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Additional safety measures and most of the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendations have been implemented following the 2017 derailment, Amtrak said. The other recommendations are being pursued, the statement said. Key among the improvements is the installment of activated positive train control, which uses GPS technology to stop or slow a train before a collision or derailment occurs. The NTSB first called for widespread use of the crash-preventing technology in 1990, and in 2008 Congress mandated that it be installed on every passenger route and high hazardous material route across the U.S. within seven years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Health care coverage has been stopped for striking maintenance and service workers at a hospital, according to a union. About 1,000 members of the the Service Employees International Union District 1999 went on strike last week at Cabell Huntington Hospital after their contract expired. Union organizing director Sherri McKinney said in a statement that the coverage was cut off without notification to striking employees and union retirees, The Herald-Dispatch reports. Hospital human resources director Molly Frick said in a statement that “union leadership was well aware that a strike would result in the cessation of pay and benefits. Any employee who wishes to return to work will have all benefits restored, including healthcare insurance.” A Cabell County judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday that was sought by the hospital prohibiting the union from certain activities outside the hospital. Frick said the activities include loud noises, such as the use of bullhorns and loud music, that have disturbed hospital patients. The injunction also prohibits strikers from honking horns and encouraging drivers to honk, blocking hospital entrances, interfering with traffic at the hospital, or making threatening statements to anyone trying to enter or leave the hospital’s campus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: People who receive a COVID-19 vaccine at a Saturday clinic at Fiserv Forum will get to have their picture taken with the Milwaukee Bucks’ championship trophy, according to a Milwaukee Health Department news release. The health department and the Bucks are teaming up for a vaccine clinic from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday in the atrium of Fiserv Forum. “Everyone vaccinated at this clinic will have the opportunity to take a photo with the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy,” a news release said. The focus of the clinic is on children ages 5 to 11, and the clinic’s offerings will include pediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. “Vaccination is the best tool to keep ourselves and our children safe from COVID-19,” Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said in a news release. “We hope the opportunity to ‘take a shot’ in the home of the 2021 World Champion Milwaukee Bucks will encourage Milwaukee children and families to get vaccinated.” The clinic will also offer first, second and booster doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for eligible individuals, the news release said. Flu shots will be available as well. Those under the age of 18 will need permission from a parent or guardian to receive a vaccine.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A grizzly bear and her four cubs who are already well-known to wildlife watchers got even more attention by taking a nighttime stroll through the city. Security video showed the bears wandering around downtown Jackson on Tuesday night, according to local police. Police and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials shooed the five bears into a less populated area near town, the Jackson Police Department said in a statement Wednesday. Grizzly No. 399, so named for an ear tag she received after being trapped for study, has been familiar to wildlife watchers for years. She’s had a reputation for lingering with her cubs near roadways in Grand Teton National Park, making her arguably the Yellowstone region’s most well-known grizzly. Biologists speculate that hanging around people helps keep away male grizzlies, which are known to kill cubs. Charming as it may seem for a mother bear and four yearling cubs to roam a tourist town, the bears’ behavior has worried wildlife managers. The bears have been raiding garbage, bee apiaries and animal feed in the Jackson area, raising the risk of a dangerous encounter with people. On Saturday, biologists trapped three of the four cubs. They put tracking collars on two in the hope that knowing the bears’ whereabouts will help prevent problems.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/23/fallen-hero-honored-manatees-rescued-rabid-bats-campus-hungry-bears-hibernating-news-around-states/111365684/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state’s preservation agency is investigating whether pottery shards, bone fragments and spearheads found near where a subdivision is being built might be evidence of an ancient settlement. Al.com reported that the Alabama Historical Commission is reviewing reports of nearby residents and an Army archaeologist who raised concerns about items found near a development called Flint Crossing, located in Huntsville near the Flint River. Jeff Benton Homes began building the subdivision last year, but nearby residents reported finding items that could be linked to a former Indian settlement in and around the site. They contacted Ben Hoksbergen, post archaeologist at the U.S. Army’s Redstone Arsenal, who said he informed the developer and the city about the finds in mid-2019. Jeff Benton, owner of Jeff Benton Homes, said in an email the company had no prior knowledge of “significant artifacts” or human burials on the site. But Hoksbergen said he found an assessment conducted by a private archaeological firm in 2010 that showed significant evidence of a Native American village at the site from roughly 500 to 900 AD. People who live near the site have sent him photos of what appeared to be bones, he said. Some bones found at the site were most likely those of deer, Hoksbergen said, but some appeared to be fragments of a human leg bone, skull and teeth. Hoksbergen said he informed the developer and the city the construction might violate laws protecting human burial or historic sites but construction continued. He also told the Alabama Historical Commission, which is conducting a review. The Alabama Historical Commission said it couldn’t comment on an active investigation, but law requires that construction stop if human remains are found at a site. Hoksbergen said an assessment of the site conducted a decade ago by Tennessee Valley Archaeological Research found a large number of artifacts.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Navy will collect public comment about its proposal for permits to again use the Gulf of Alaska for training exercises, a spokeswoman said. “Anytime the Navy wants to do any sort of action, they have to go through an Environmental Impact Statement,” said Julianne Stanford of Navy Region Northwest. Exercise Northern Edge is a major Army, Navy and Air Force exercise held every two years across Alaska, the Juneau Empire reported. The supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its escorts took part in exercises last year. The public has expressed concern about Navy sonar and explosive ordnance disturbing marine life. The environmental review, Stanford said, is about hearing concerns so that the Navy can avoid negatively affecting marine mammals such as humpback whales, gray whales and Steller sea lions. The Gulf of Alaska has been a training ground for more than three decades, Stanford said, and best practices have been put in place to minimize disruptions. The Navy and regulatory agencies have not noted changes in marine mammals numbers in training areas, she said. “The Navy has developed numerous mitigations that include navigating away from marine mammals, implementing exclusion zones to cease activities or power down and shut down equipment if marine mammals are in proximity to training,” Stanford said.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:The school board ended its yearslong superintendent search Saturday, unanimously naming Scott Menzel its permanent leader. The decision came after 18 hours of deliberations that started Friday morning. Five groups composed of teachers, students, parents and residents, administrators and staff members in the Scottsdale Unified School District interviewed three finalists and provided feedback to the board. Menzel currently serves as superintendent of the Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was one of three finalists who had been narrowed from 29 applicants. The other finalists included Kimberly Guerin, the district’s assistant superintendent of educational services, and Shelley Redinger, superintendent of Spokane (Washington) Public Schools. Menzel has led Washtenaw for eight years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He earned doctorate degrees in philosophy and educational leadership from Eastern Michigan University. He was a finalist in Peoria Unified School District’s superintendent search, which concluded in December. The Scottsdale board deliberated all day Friday and for six hours Saturday about the decision, according to spokeswoman Amy Bolton. The board chose to meet Saturday to ensure continuity of discussions and to not prolong the decision, she said. Current Superintendent John Kriekard’s contract runs through June 30. District officials hope Menzel could begin on July 1. Kriekard came out of retirement to provide the district a steadying hand when Denise Birdwell resigned in April 2018 after more than a year of controversy.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The head of the state lottery said he opposes a measure a group is trying to get on the ballot that would allow thousands of coin-operated “amusement machines” across the state to raise money for the lottery program. Lottery Director Bishop Woosley announced his opposition with the leaders of a group formed to campaign against the constitutional amendment vying for a spot on Arkansas’ ballot. Supporters of the proposal have until July 3 to gather nearly 90,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the November election. The amendment would require the lottery to issue 50 licenses to own and lease the machines that would award noncash prizes such as lottery tickets or vouchers for merchandise valued at less than $5. Each licensee would be allowed to operate up to 300 machines. Twenty percent of net receipts from the machines would go toward the state’s lottery. But Woosley said the machines would ultimately result in a loss to the state, with the lottery facing additional costs for licensing and oversight. He also criticized the measure for prohibiting any local limits on the machines. Arcade Arkansas, the group behind the expanded gambling proposal, has raised more than $360,000 and spent nearly $359,000 on its campaign. A spokesman for the group said Woosley was entitled to his opinion but believed opponents were mischaracterizing the proposal, noting it wouldn’t allow cash prizes. The measure is vying for the ballot months after Arkansas implemented a voter-approved amendment legalizing casinos in four counties. Casinos have opened at a West Memphis dog track, a Hot Springs horse track and another location in Pine Bluff under the amendment. Protect Arkansas Communities, a group launched to oppose the proposed amendment, hasn’t received any money from the casinos but has reached out to them, campaign consultant Robert McLarty told reporters.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBrentwood: A bomb used to get rid of gophers might have started a brush fire in a Northern California suburb, authorities told the East Bay Times. The fire that started about 2:30 p.m. Friday burned seven acres in Brentwood in Contra Costa County, Firefighters put out the blaze two hours later, the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District said. If the fire is determined to have been started by a gopher bomb, it would be reminiscent of a scene in the 1980 movie “Caddyshack” in which a frustrated groundskeeper played by Bill Murray used dynamite in a futile effort to get rid of a burrowing rodent. No injuries were reported in connection with the fire. “We would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone to be mindful of their conditions and this early season fire should be a reminder of what can happen very quickly,” the East Contra Costa fire district wrote on Facebook, calling the blaze accidental.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Police are looking for a person who broke into a woman’s apartment and stole her underwear last week – and they are asking anyone with a similar situation to report it. The victim came home from work on Feb. 10 and reported someone had ransacked her apartment and stolen her underwear, according to a news release from police. Police have not identified any suspects. Because of the potential sexual motivation of the crime, police are asking anyone with information or other unreported incidents to come forward. “We know that people typically don’t call police if an item of clothing is missing,” Sgt. Heather Moore, who leads the Crimes Against Persons Unit, said in a video statement. “If you’ve had personal items disappear from your home and you suspect they may have been stolen, please contact police. In any situation that just feels off, trust your instincts and give us a call. Your tip may be our best lead.” Anyone with information is asked to contact officer RJ Tutle at 970-416-2825 or email tipsline@fcgov.com. People who wish to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868 or www.stopcriminals.org.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Puerto Rico residents looking to relocate to Connecticut after recent natural disasters are getting financial assistance to help with housing. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that $75,000 in state funding will be allocated to provide housing support for Puerto Rican residents coming to the state after recent earthquakes on the island territory. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin told a news conference Friday that when news of natural disasters reaches the state, thousands of residents wonder if their family members are going to be all right. He added that many in Puerto Rico also look to Connecticut as a place of refuge and a possible new home. Connecticut already has a large population of Puerto Rican descent. The money will be used to make security deposits or help with paying rent and will be distributed to nonprofit organizations like Alpha Community Services in Bridgeport, Casa Otoñal in New Haven, and the San Juan Center in Hartford, among others. Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruna noted in a release that over the last few years Puerto Rican families have suffered devastating natural disasters including the recent earthquakes. Hurricane Maria – a Category 5 hurricane – struck the island in 2017.\n\nDelaware\n\nMagnolia:A 9-year-old girl stricken with cancer appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Feb. 20, according to the Love 4 Layla Facebook page dedicated to her cancer fight. A preview of the segment posted online showed Layla Mosley and several other children with cancer surprised by an appearance by rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs. Mosley, who is fighting an extremely rare form of bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma, appeared on the program in coordination with Fighting All Monsters, a nonprofit group supporting children facing life-threatening illnesses. The group had been leading an online campaign for Combs to dance with their children. The children even made a dance video to Combs’ “Bad Boy for Life” to entice the entertainer to join them. In the “Ellen” preview clip, Combs surprised the children and Mosley told DeGeneres about how her trip to California had been. “So far it’s been great. I’m just so excited to be here to see you because I watch your show all the time. I love your ‘Game of Games’ show and I just love everything about you,” she tells a smiling DeGeneres, eliciting applause and “aws” from the audience. With eight children seated in front of her, DeGeneres responds with a deadpan joke: “Look, I hate to pick favorites, but she is mine.” When Combs appeared after faking out the audience with a taped video apologizing for not attending, Mosley leapt off the couch and was the first child to run across the stage and jump in his arms. Her segment was apparently filmed on Feb. 19 with Love 4 Layla posting, “She had the most incredible day!! Lots more pictures to come!! Layla is having the best time ever out in Hollywood!”\\ Mosley’s cancer fight isn’t her first. In 2016, she was first diagnosed with metastatic Ewing’s Sarcoma at the age of 5, which affects only about 200 children and young adults in the United States annually. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for the Stage 4 cancer, completing a 16-month fight. But after two years, she relapsed in May and has been fighting ever since with help from her friends and family, who have set up a GoFundMe page and have held fundraisers and raffles for her.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The DC Board of Elections confirmed that some mailers went out with the wrong primary date, WUSA-TV reported. The correct primary date is June 2. The District actually has two elections coming up before the general election. The primary is first on June 2. A couple of weeks later, on June 16, DC is holding a special election for Jack Evans’ former position, the Ward 2 council seat. The Board of Elections said some people received voter registration cards with a different election date listed. Ladawnae White, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Board of Elections, said some of the cards listed the primary as the third Tuesday in June. White said the mix-up happened, because of an earlier template created before the primary date was changed to June 2. She said the template has been updated to reflect the June 2 date, and all future mailings will have the correct date printed. In a statement released on Twitter, the Board of Elections said in part, “We regret the error and will correct it in all future communications ... We have planned a number of future communications about important events in this election cycle, and voters will be well-informed about when and where to vote.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A female manatee named Marlin and its calf were rescued after wildlife specialists found them injured in Florida waters. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported the pair was being treated for wounds and infections at the Miami Seaquarium. The mother was found Saturday with boat strike wounds. The female calf has a wound on her underside. On Tuesday, rescuers initially spotted the mother swimming sideways, which indicates lung damage. On Wednesday, the manatees swam away and disappeared under a low bridge in Fort Lauderdale. After Saturday’s rescue by experts from SeaWorld in Orlando and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, both were started on antibiotics. Marlin will be scheduled for a procedure where veterinarians will drain liquid or air from its chest. The newspaper said boats and other watercraft were the biggest cause of manatee deaths statewide last year, causing at least 136 of the 606 animal deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Health officials said students at Savannah State University have been warned after a rabid bat was found on campus. The Chatham County Health Department said the bat tested positive for rabies after it was taken to a veterinarian. It was found Feb. 18 on the rear porch of the school’s College of Business Administration building. The health department said in a news release it was interviewing students who had contact with the bat to determine whether they needed treatment. Rabies is a potentially fatal disease that can be spread from infected animals to humans through bites, scratches and other contact. Health department officials said people should be aware of the risk of possible rabies exposure before getting close to wild animals such as bats, foxes and raccoons.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, according to federal officials and municipal authorities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the island reached its highest temperatures last year and the National Weather Service said 273 daily temperature records were tied or broken across the state,Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. A separate study by the City and County of Honolulu also found the state experienced its hottest recorded day last year. The city’s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency performed the first Community Heat Assessment on Aug. 31. The study found the maximum heat index in several Oahu communities was more than 100 degrees, with Waimalu Plaza Shopping Center recording the highest temperature at 107.3. “By all indications, that’s the new normal,” said Josh Stanbro, Honolulu’s chief resilience officer. “So that’s why we have to take action immediately to try to reverse that trend. We have to completely slam on the brakes in terms of burning carbon fuels for our energy source.” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Wednesday that increasing the city’s tree canopy is expected to help cool communities. City officials advised residents to protect themselves from high temperatures, especially children and the elderly. Honolulu Emergency Services Director Jim Howe urged residents to not leave children or pets in locked cars on hot days and advised surfers and stand-up paddleboarders to drink a liter of water before heading onto the water. “The time you need to be most prepared is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” Howe said. “Every one of our lifeguards here knows that when you’re out at the beach, the first place you go is you go for the shade. So you want to stay in the shade and you want to stay well-hydrated.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Companies that are responsible for checking the quality of Idaho’s road materials have altered the results of their asphalt tests thousands of times, government documents showed. Those changes might have allowed contractors that repair and build Idaho’s highway infrastructure to get bonus payments when they should have been penalized for substandard work – or even forced to tear up the asphalt and replace it. For decades, Idaho has paid private contractors to repair and build the state’s vast system of highways, roads and bridges, the Idaho Statesman reported. They are trusted to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and to ensure the state’s infrastructure is built to last and is safe for drivers. Although roads are under construction, Idaho and other states require contractors to take samples of the asphalt they’re using and run it through a series of tests. Those tests determine whether the asphalt is high quality and the right kind of material for that road. Can it withstand the winter snow and ice in northern Idaho? Can it withstand all the drivers and truckers who travel Interstate 84 in southern Idaho? Front-line workers for several companies involved in road construction throughout Idaho were recorded in 2018 changing their test results before submitting the results to the state for payment, a Statesman analysis of government records found. A Statesman analysis of four highway projects completed in 2018 found that Idaho paid contractors about $8 million, including about $190,000 in bonuses, for asphalt whose test results were altered dozens or hundreds of times. Internal documents from the Idaho Transportation Department say such changes might have allowed construction companies to receive more money than the asphalt was worth. For Idaho taxpayers, that would mean more funds went to private contracting firms and less went to other projects to fix potholes, strengthen highways and improve the state’s crumbling transportation network.\n\nIllinois\n\nBelleville: Cancer-causing chemicals used over the years at Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois might have leaked into local water supplies, according to a report from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The state’s EPA said an expanded site inspection is set to begin this summer for signs of the class of substances known collectively as PFAS, which are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they take thousands of years to degrade, the Belleville News-Democrat reported. The newspaper obtained the agency’s report through requesting records under the Freedom of Information Act. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said the Air Force contacted his office this month with preliminary details on the contamination at the base and his office has reached out to local elected officials to determine next steps. In recent days, officials started contacting those potentially affected. There is no reason for concern if a person uses tap water from a municipal supply, according to Col. Joseph R. Meyer, vice commander of the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott AFB. However, people should worry if they live near the base and drink from a private well. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center is locating and contacting anyone who uses a well within one mile southeast of the base. The center’s officials have identified five people who do so. The Air Force will test well water for PFAS levels, Meyer said. The EPA considers levels below 70 parts per trillion, which equates to roughly a drop of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, to be safe for consumption. If tests of well water reveal PFAS levels above EPA standards, individuals who use those wells should immediately stop drinking the water. High levels can cause cancer and birth defects, among other health problems, the EPA said. The Air Force will provide free bottles of water as it develops a long-term solution, Meyer said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An Indiana woman who had given birth just a few days earlier said her instincts kicked in when she stopped along a highway to help save a driver who was on fire after his tanker truck loaded with jet fuel burst into flames. Holly McNally, 35, had just left a hospital’s neointensive care unit Thursday afternoon with her mother after they checked in on her son Connor, who was born Monday. They saw the overturned truck and flames along an Interstate 465 bridge that crosses over Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’ far east side. McNally said she slowed her car and was stunned to see the 59-year-old driver on fire after he managed to get out of the truck on his own. McNally, who has three other children, ages 8, 11 and 15, said that despite the risk to herself, she knew she had to help. Running toward the driver, McNally crossed paths with another man who was bringing a blanket to help extinguish the flames and cover the driver, whose clothes had burned off. As they began walking him away from the fire, an explosion rocked the overturned truck, which the driver told them was loaded with 4,000 gallons of jet fuel. A second explosion then caused the fire to spread and follow the three of them down the embankment. and the driver, who appeared to be in shock, began to slow down. Luckily, another man ran to the embankment and helped move the driver to safety. Another Indiana State Police trooper drove down the highway embankment to meet the three rescuers and the driver. He used clothing from his gym bag to cover the man until emergency medical technicians arrived, Indianapolis Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith said. The driver remained hospitalized in critical condition Friday morning, Reith said. Trucking company Jet Star Inc. released a statement Friday, thanking those who helped save the driver, which it identified as Jeffrey “Duke” Denman.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Dozens of South Sudanese Iowans and allies gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday for a peaceful rally protesting recent violence that left more than 30 dead and 15 children abducted in Abyei, a long disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan. Both countries – that after years of civil war split into independent nations in 2011 – claim the Abyei region in east Africa for ethnic and economic reasons. As a result, clashes between South Sudan’s ethnic Dinkla villages, and Misseriya, a nomadic tribe from Sudan, occur regularly in the region. The United Nations has more than 5,300 peacekeepers – known as the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei – deployed in the region to ease tensions and protect civilians. But on Jan. 22, a suspected Misseriya attack on the Dinkla village of Kolom left at least 32 people dead, dozens wounded and 15 children abducted. Six children have since been recovered. Protesters at Saturday’s rally said children have been abducted and placed into slavery. South Sudan’s government claims the UN failed to protect Kolom and South Sudanese Iowans have expressed anger, as well. During the rally, Abyei community leaders educated attendees on the history of the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan and the status of Abyei. Protesters chanted “Justice, justice for Abyei! Justice, justice for Kolom! Shame, shame UNISFA! Abyei is bleeding and the world is watching!” Some held signs showing graphic images reportedly from the attack last month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers are considering blocking the sale of raw milk or requiring farmers to include warning labels on packaging after the state abandoned a law prohibiting farmers from advertising raw milk outside their farm. The state stopped enforcing the ban after Shepherd’s Gate Dairy operators Mark and Coraleen Bunner filed a lawsuit against the state in October, The Wichita Eagle reported. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and the state Department of Agriculture settled the lawsuit in November resulting in the end of the ban. Schmidt admitted the law was “plainly unconstitutional.” Pasteurized milk undergoes a heating process to kill pathogens. Raw milk that comes straight from a cow or goat is much more likely to carry salmonella, E. coli and other bacteria, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But those who drink and sell raw milk think of it as an all-natural product that brings people closer to the source of their food. The Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a bill Thursday that would allow the on-farm sale of raw, unpasteurized milk, so long as each container sold labels it as such. It goes next to the Senate for debate, possibly next week. It remains unknown how the Legislature as a whole would vote. A bill to ban the sale of raw milk have also been proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Gov. Andy Beshear signed legislation Friday to require that law enforcement officers carry weapons when assigned to provide security at schools. The measure won strong bipartisan support in the legislature. It’s a follow-up to last year’s sweeping school safety law stemming from a 2018 fatal school shooting in Kentucky. Beshear had until Friday to either sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. In announcing his decision, the governor repeated concerns that the bill’s supporters made for arming school officers – that other law officers couldn’t respond quickly enough to a school shooting. Beshear said he considers the presence of armed officers at schools as a potential deterrent. Republican Sen. Max Wise, the bill’s lead sponsor, said the governor’s action signing the measure into law will go down as an “incredibly important day” for the state. The measure is crucial to the state’s efforts to bolster school safety, Wise said. Last year’s school safety law did not specify whether school police officers – known as school resource officers – needed to carry a weapon. The issue of arming school-based officers has sparked intense debate in the state’s largest school district, which includes Louisville. Beshear said Friday he hopes concerns about arming school officers can be alleviated through the officers’ training.Executive Cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said Beshear’s administration welcomes suggestions from the bill’s critics on shaping curriculum and training for school officers. The school safety efforts are in response to the 2018 shooting at Marshall County High School in western Kentucky, where two 15-year-old students, Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when another student opened fire.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state can soon start spending $1.2 billion in federal cash to fortify communities against future flood risks, after the governor’s office announced Friday that federal officials have approved the state’s plan for the funds. The dollars, overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, will bolster an effort that Gov. John Bel Edwards has pushed since the 2016 floods to use regional approaches to flood mitigation and drainage improvements around Louisiana. “HUD’s approval of our plan confirms that Louisiana is headed in the right direction,” Edwards said in a statement. “We have taken proactive steps and served as a blueprint for other states preparing their own flood mitigation plans to use these federal funds in ways that prioritize data, science and regional collaboration to build resilience in the face of future flooding.” The federal aid will be spread across projects in 46 Louisiana parishes identified through the governor’s Louisiana Watershed Initiative as most flood-prone and impacted by water. Edwards’ office said the state expects the federal dollars to be available by the spring.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Seasonal ferry service between Maine and Nova Scotia is scheduled to resume this summer. Bay Ferries, the Canadian ferry company, said service is expected to begin by June 26, the Bangor Daily News reported Friday. The Cat, a high-speed catamaran, will sail between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Bar Harbor until Labor Day, said Bay Ferries CEO Mark MacDonald. Crossings will then run six days a week – every day but Wednesdays –until the season ends on Oct. 13. The ferry company has to finish its $6.5 million renovation of a Bar Harbor terminal before service can resume, MacDonald said. The company needs to finish installing U.S. Customs and Border inspection booths and renovating the interior of the building.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Salisbury University said a suspect has been identified in the investigation into racist graffiti on campus, but that person’s identity has yet to be made public. The case is being referred to the Wicomico County state’s attorney’s office for prosecution, according to a Friday news release. The only identifying information about the suspect released so far is that the person is not believed to have an “immediate connection to the campus.” The release does not state if the person is a suspect in one or multiple incidents. The investigation began after the discovery in October and November of vandalism in Fulton Hall involving racist and sexually explicit language that escalated to a threat of violence. More racist graffiti was found on campus on Feb. 19, first in Henson Hall and then in Fulton Hall. That same day the university announced the FBI had been aiding campus police in the open investigations. Administrators canceled classes Thursday for a day of healing, during which various gatherings were scheduled to support students and faculty.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNorton: Authorities have identified a man killed in what authorities said appears to be an explosion caused by a meth lab in Massachusetts. The Bristol County District Attorney’s Office identified the man on Sunday as 38-year-old Edward Rooney. Authorities said Rooney died Saturday after an apparent meth lab explosion in his Norton apartment. Police said they were called to the apartment complex around 1 a.m. and found damage believed to have been caused by the explosion. Police said Rooney had fled the home before first responders arrived. A short time later, authorities were called to an Attleboro home to help a man who was experiencing a medical emergency, officials said. Authorities said residents of the home were awoken in the middle of the night by a man outside who was screaming for help. Officials said the residents let Rooney inside the home, where he collapsed. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.\n\nMichigan\n\nVanderbilt: The state’s 108,000-acre Pigeon River Country State Forest is getting a nearly 600-acre addition in a land deal valued at more than $2 million, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The property purchase, completed last month, added the Elk Forest at Black River, which is in Montmorency County, to the state’s public lands. The area is surrounded on three sides by existing state-managed land and includes public access to Walled Lake. The money came from the state’s Forest Legacy Program with matching funds from the agency’s Land Exchange Facilitation Fund and a $75,000 donation from the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, according to state officials. “This spectacular place adds a gem to the crown of Michigan’s public lands,” said Debbie Begalle, DNR forest resources division chief, in a statement. “The land will be open for hiking, hunting, fishing, elk viewing, skiing, snowshoeing, bird watching, mushroom hunting and berry picking, to name just a few activities.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:The state on Friday shut down a metal recycling company where a fire burned for days and sent up plumes of smoke. The state cited “imminent and substantial danger” to the public, the Star Tribune reported. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued an administrative order prohibiting Northern Metal Recycling from accepting any scrap metal at its plant in Becker, the site of the fire. The order also prohibits the company from accepting scrap metal at its previous facility in north Minneapolis, where it still has many junked cars stored. On Friday, Gov. Tim Walz said he is considering placing a30-day hold on Northern Metal’s recycling permit. Speaking at a forum organized by the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, Walz said he is looking at ways to hold Northern Metal responsible for pollution caused by last week’s fire. Walz told the audience that he does not trust Northern Metal “to do the right thing,” KMSP-TV reported. The Democratic governor said state regulators would make the decision on a 30-day hold. On Feb. 11, a week before the fire erupted, fire inspectors cited Northern Metal’s former facility in north Minneapolis for a variety of code violations related to its outdoor storage practices, the Star Tribune reported, citing inspection records. A state fire marshal investigator was at the scene Friday. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Police said Thursday that firefighters had the blaze under control, but the fire flared late Thursday, sending more smoke over Becker. Classes in Becker were canceled Thursday but resumed Friday. On Friday, police said firefighting efforts have been turned over to a private company hired by Northern Metal. The fire has been reduced to a few smoldering areas and could be extinguished by the end of the weekend, police said. Residents of the city of 4,500 people have not been asked to evacuate but should stay away from the immediate area of the fire, police said. Becker is about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Northern Metal moved its shredding operation from Minneapolis to Becker last year after the Pollution Control Agency ordered it shut down because of high levels of air pollution and inaccurately recorded pollution.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia:Authorities said they’re testing the air quality after a pipe ruptured, prompting the evacuations of more than 300 residents and sending dozens of people to hospitals. The Mississippi Department of Emergency Management said 46 people were treated at area hospitals after the Saturday night rupture, but all of them had been released by late Sunday morning. Authorities said the 24-inch pressurized pipe ruptured in a heavily wooded area near Satartia, about 40 miles northwest of Jackson. They said the pipe contained carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and that residents in the area complained of green gas and a noxious odor. Residents were expected to be able to return to their homes soon, emergency officials said in an update late Sunday morning. It appears the ground caved into a ravine, damaging the 24-inch pipe, the state agency said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri might have shed its unwanted image as the meth lab capital of the U.S., but the dangerous and addictive drug remains a major problem, a top Drug Enforcement Administration official said Friday. The depth of the problem became clear Thursday when the DEA announced a methamphetamine crackdown called Operation Crystal Shield, which will focus on eight “transportation hubs” where high levels of Mexican meth are being seized. The St. Louis Division, which covers all of Missouri and Kansas as well as southern Illinois, is the northernmost of the eight targeted areas. The others are Atlanta, Dallas, El Paso, Texas, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Phoenix. The targeted DEA divisions accounted for more than 75% of all meth seizures last year. The St. Louis Division includes hundreds of miles of major roadways through the three states, including interstates 35, 70, 44 and 55, providing a pipeline not only to the central U.S. but the upper Midwest and the Northeast. William J. Callahan, special agent in charge of the St. Louis Division, said the targeted operation will allow better coordination of intelligence about trafficking routes, the types of vehicles being used, and other information. For many years, meth was a two-pronged problem: Much of it came from Mexico, but thousands of users across the U.S. made their own drug in home labs or by mixing the dangerous concoction in a 2-liter soda bottle. In 2004, more than 24,000 meth labs were seized across the U.S., including nearly 3,000 in Missouri, which for years was atop the list of states for lab seizures.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. Interior Department officials are seeking to bolster their case for easing restrictions on energy development, mining and grazing in Western states inhabited by a declining bird species. A federal judge in Idaho blocked Trump administration plans last year over concerns that they could harm greater sage grouse, a ground-dwelling bird. Assistant Interior Secretary Casey Hammond said a new set of environmental studies published Friday clarified the steps the government will take to conserve the bird’s habitat. The Interior Department opened a 45-day public comment period on the studies that cover millions of acres of public lands in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and California. Sage grouse have been in decline for decades because of habitat loss and other factors, and their numbers dropped sharply last year across much of their range. Sage grouse territory in Montana, Washington and the Dakotas was not impacted by the proposed changes. The legal dispute over the administration’s proposal is before Judge B. Lynn Winmill In Idaho. The case dates to 2016, when environmental groups sued the Obama administration over a previous set of rules that they described as insufficient to protect grouse from heading toward extinction.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The U.S. Department of Transportation said it’s awarding $10.7 million in airport safety and infrastructure grants to 18 airports in Nebraska. The grants include $750,000 to go to parking lot improvements and construction of an access road at Blair Municipal Airport. The department is sending Lincoln Airport $360,000 to buy snow removal equipment and $450,000 to update the airport master plan. Hartington Municipal Airport is getting $549,000 for runway rehabilitation, and Hebron Municipal Airport will receive $315,000 to fund the sealing of apron pavement surface and joints, plus the sealing of taxiway pavement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Four Nevada firefighters recently returned from Australia, and three more will be deployed in the coming weeks to help with fire suppression efforts, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Firefighters Brian Holmes, Eric Tilden and Joe Miller returned to Nevada on Feb. 5. Another firefighter, Justin Cutler, also returned on Feb. 10, officials said in a news release. Holmes, who usually serves as an engine captain in the Southern Nevada District, worked as a task force leader and crew member in Australia. Tilden, a fire helicopter supervisor in the Elko District, also served as a task force leader and crew member. Miller, an air tank base manager at the Battle Mountain District, served also served as an air tanker base manager in Australia. He also provided other aviation assistance, officials said. Cutler, an assistant superintendent for the Silver State Hotshots based out of Carson City, served as an aerial tactical supervisor. The BLM also deployed two more firefighters to Australia, and three more will be sent in a few weeks. In total, 11 firefighters were deployed to assist in the fire suppression efforts. The two firefighters who were recently deployed and the three others expected to fly oversees are set to return in March. Since 2000, Australia has deployed fire management specialists six times to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. has sent firefighters and fire managers to help with the fire season in Australia four times since 2003. The two countries have exchanged techniques, policies, and information as far back as 1964.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: State wildlife officials warn that bears are more active this winter because of mild weather combined with limited snowfall. New Hampshire Fish and Game officers said bears are encouraged to remain active because of the amount of available food, WMUR-TV reported Friday. Bears typically hibernate from November to April, but in a mild winter, that period can be shortened to December or January until March. “Bears aren’t actually true hibernators,” said Daniel Bergeron, of New Hampshire Fish and Game. “So, they can wake and go back out and get food and go back in and den up for an extended period of time. So just because they’re up doesn’t mean they’re up for good.” Vermont wildlife officials voiced similar concerns about bear activity earlier this month. Wildlife officials in New Hampshire and Vermont have recommended moving any potential outdoor food sources to prevent attracting bears.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Wildlife authorities and utility officials have been taking aim at one of the leading killers of bald eagles in New Jersey – electrocution on power lines. There is growing concern about protecting the endangered birds from getting electrocuted by power lines when they nest in suburban and urban areas following a spike in the eagle population, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Between 2015 and 2019, electrocution was the top cause of death of raptors found injured or killed, according to data compiled in annual reports by the New Jersey Bald Eagle Project, a partnership overseen by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife and Conserve Wildlife Foundation. In addition to the 34 eagle deaths, crashes into vehicles left 29 eagles dead and fights with other eagles killed 14. The cause of 29 other deaths remains unknown, and officials said some deaths are undocumented.Kathleen Clark, supervising zoologist for the state’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, said an electrocuted 4-year-old eagle was found on a recent Sunday near Pickle Factory Pond in Belleplain State Forest. Cristina Frank, a biologist and raptor specialist who manages avian protection for Atlantic City Electric, said utilities can’t realistically bury all distribution lines, so they install protective equipment or build-in protections on new lines. The measures can include cross-arms on existing lines to spread wires farther apart, insulated conductors, or covering energized or grounded equipment. Some utilities also install barriers to prevent birds from perching and mark lines with colored tape or reflectors to warn birds from flying into them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The funeral service for Sgt. 1st. Class Antonio Rey Rodriguez of Las Cruces, who was killed in action on Feb. 8 while serving in Afghanistan, was held Friday afternoon at Cathedral of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. There wasn’t an empty seat in the church as hundreds of residents, military members and veterans joined Rodriguez’s family and close friends to honor the fallen hero. Students from Valley View Elementary, which is across the street from the church, also paid tribute to the soldier before and after the ceremony by waving American flags. During the service, Rodriguez was described by many as a hero, warrior, an inspiration and a child of God who gave the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and to save others. Rodriguez, 28, was born and raised in Las Cruces and was affectionately known as “Rod.” He graduated from Mayfield High School in 2009. According to the Department of Defense, a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha from 7th Special Forces Group was ambushed in Afghanistan on Feb. 8 by a rogue Afghan policeman in the Sherzad district of Nangarhar Province, located in eastern Afghanistan. It resulted in the deaths of two American operators, including Rodriguez and Sgt. 1st Class Javier Jaguar Gutierrez of San Antonio. Six others were wounded. Rodriguez joined the Army in October 2009, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Operations Command. After completing the Basic Airborne Course and the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, he was assigned to the 3rd Ranger Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment. He deployed eight times with the 75th Ranger Regiment and twice with 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. During his military service, Rodriguez earned the Bronze Star Medal-2, Joint Service Commendation Medal-1, and Expert and Combat Infantryman Badge. Rodriguez posthumously earned the Purple Heart, Combat Action Badge, Bronze Star Medal (1 OLC) and Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nNew York\n\nWest Nyack: An Orthodox Jewish man credited as a hero for attacking a knife-wielding man who stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City is refusing to take a $20,000 reward from established Jewish groups because he considers them Zionists, according to a rabbi who knows him. Officials with the Jewish Federation and the Anti-Defamation League told The Journal News that they were caught off guard by Josef Gluck’s decision to turn down the reward, the newspaper reported Friday. “The reward would have been for anybody who offered information that would lead to an arrest,” said Miriam Allenson, spokesperson for the Jewish Federation & Foundation of Rockland County. “That was what was on our minds.” Allenson said that there were no strings with the money and that the groups had “no idea” regarding Gluck’s decision to turn away the funds. The reward presentation event was scheduled for Feb. 6, but Gluck said he had a family emergency, Allenson said. Rabbi Dovid Feldman of Monsey said Gluck’s decision stems from the discomfort he and some other Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox Jews have with organizations like the Jewish Federation and Anti-Defamation League. Feldman said Gluck was preparing to notify the groups in writing to explain in more detail his reasons for declining the reward. Rabbi Feldman is a leader of Neturei Karta International. Its Orthodox Jewish members believe “the entire concept of a sovereign Jewish state is contrary to Jewish Law.” Gluck is credited with throwing his body in front of the machete-wielding man and using a wooden table to try and stop the Dec. 28 assault in Monsey, the newspaper reported. He then lured the attacker outside and documented the attacker’s license plate number and alerted police.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The body of a 6-month-old boy who had been reported missing has been found in a North Carolina cemetery and his mother is under arrest, authorities said Saturday. Law enforcement officials said the body of Chi-Liam Cody Brown-Erickson was found about 4 a.m. Saturday at Sharon Memorial Park in Charlotte. The boy’s body was found about six hours after Tamara Jernel Brown, 30, was arrested by Charlotte police for common law robbery and two counts of assault on a government official. She reportedly refused to tell police where her son was. Brown and the boy had been reported missing Thursday night. Authorities had said before Brown’s arrest that she might be suffering from a mental health disability and was last seen walking in uptown Charlotte around noon Friday\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to keep the name of Custer Park, despite efforts to change it because of the eponym’s history with Native Americans. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. Two Bismarck women led the effort to change the name. Three Affiliated Tribes member M. Angel Moniz said that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide. The Bismarck Tribune said commissioners Thursday adopted a formal process to rename city parks and to install an educational marker at Custer Park. Under the new process, there can’t be another proposal to rename Custer Park for 15 years. In 1868, Custer launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death..\n\nOhio\n\nMassillon: A family thinks an unmarked grave might hold the answer to the mystery of a relative’s disappearance 50 years ago. Russell Brunner was 31 when he disappeared from his home at the former Massillon State Hospital in 1970, where he had been committed as a teen because of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, his sister, Rita Tod, told The Repository. Although the hospital allegedly told his family that Brunner had been discharged, a body was found in 1972 in a barn on the grounds where Brunner worked, the paper said. Although the coroner at the time apparently suspected the body was Brunner’s, the coroner didn’t identify him as Brunner and the body was declared an “unknown male” before it was buried in the city cemetery in Massillon in northeastern Ohio, according to The Repository. Brunner was known to have worked in the same barn, the remains fit his description and state hospital-issued items were found on the body, the paper said. An investigation into existing records by The Repository along with its interviews with Brunner’s surviving siblings indicated the body is most likely Brunner and that he died by killing himself. The current county coroner agreed with the paper’s findings. Because there was no evidence of foul play, the family would need a court order to exhume the remains and would have to pay that cost and any testing, the coroner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed one regent on Friday to the governing boards of each of the state’s top two public universities. Stitt named Anita Holloway of accounting firm Ernst & Young to the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, which oversees OU, Cameron University in Lawton and Rogers State University in Claremore. He also named western Oklahoma rancher and banker Jimmy Harrel to the Oklahoma A&M Colleges Board of Regents, which oversees Oklahoma State University and four other regional universities. Both appointments will require Senate confirmation. Holloway replaces outgoing OU Regent Leslie Rainbolt-Forbes, whose term ends March 21. Harrel replaces Lou Watkins, whose term ends in April. Rainbolt-Forbes served as chair of the OU Board of Regents during an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against longtime OU President David Boren, who retired in 2018.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The main Oregon highway connecting Salem and Bend reopened Saturday after a tanker crash and gas spill forced a weeklong closure. The double tanker trunk spilled an estimated 7,800 gallons of petroleum products into the soil at the crash site east of Idanha, the Statesman Journal newspaper in Salem reported. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said in a prepared statement that water quality tests done on the North Santiam River show the concentration of petroleum levels is below federal safe drinking water levels except for in the immediate vicinity of the crash. The agency said there is no impact to nearby cities’ drinking water, and workers will continue to test the water quality in the area periodically. Cleanup crews dug up and hauled away about 6,200 tons of contaminated soil. Workers also added a new guardrail near the site of the crash. The area has had two major tanker crashes and spills into the North Santiam River in the last three years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nChambersburg:A military repair depot in central Pennsylvania has announced plans to lay off or reassign hundreds of contract employees because of an anticipated decrease in workload. Letterkenny Army Depot said the reduction will affect 323 contract personnel, nearly half of its contract positions. Up to 75 positions will be cut on or about March 10, and up to 248 additional workers will lose their jobs by September, although some workers could be reassigned. Officials said the reduction will affect about 15% of its total workforce of approximately 2,200 employees. Spokeswoman Lisa Baker said nearly one-third of all employees are contract personnel, while the others are federal employees. Letterkenny, which is north of Chambersburg, is one of Franklin County’s top employers, with workers repairing tactical missile systems, route clearance vehicles, electrical generators and other items. Letterkenny Munitions Center on the depot stores rockets and ammunition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s motor vehicles division is temporarily opening its headquarters on some Saturdays so residents can upgrade their driver’s license to meet federal requirements that will affect air travel. The Cranston office will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on select Saturdays of each month, as the October deadline for the federal REAL ID program approaches. Appointments must be made online first. Current Rhode Island licenses aren’t compliant with the federal program, which was enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks to strengthen rules for identification. The federal law requires state driver’s licenses and ID cards to have security enhancements and to be issued to people who can prove they are legally in the United States. Beginning in October, noncompliant IDs won’t be sufficient for boarding a plane or entering secure federal facilities or military bases. The weekend service is limited to REAL ID transactions for those obtaining or renewing passenger-vehicle driver licenses and state IDs. Appointments for commercial driver license services, including REAL ID, are available on weekdays.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Coast Guard plans to consolidate its facilities across the South Carolina coast to an old naval shipyard near Charleston and plans to base national security vessels at the new site, Adm. Karl Schultz said. The moves are linked with dredging of Charleston Harbor, which when competed in 2021 will make it the deepest harbor on the East Coast. The Coast Guard is looking to add three national security cutters to the two already stationed in Charleston and also place a group of offshore patrol cutters that might soon be built, Shultz said. That could double the Coast Guard population in the area to about 2,000 people, Shultz said. “A community like Charleston understands just how important our defense contributions are to the nation. And for generations, the people of this great port city have also appreciated the importance of maritime commerce to our nation,” Shultz said. The Coast Guard has property in Charleston from the tip of the city’s peninsula through North Charleston. They will all be consolidated at the old Naval Shipyard in North Charleston on the Cooper River, Shultz said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The city plans a makeover at its namesake park, and officials hope infusing some friendly competition between companies in the architecture and design world will lift the project to new heights. In the last two decades, the city has added dozens of acres to the boundaries of Falls Park through land acquisitions and parcel redevelopment. And it has become the destination for hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. That’s why officials with the Parks and Recreation Department said the walkways and layout of the pedestrian elements of the park campus are no longer adequate and need to be upgraded. With that in mind, City Hall last week announced it will use a design competition to gather ideas for expanding and improving the infrastructure at Falls Park in the coming years. A design competition is an alternative to a more typical process used by the city, where one architecture firm is hired to create a design before a construction company is hired. Instead, the city will put out a call for designs in hopes of spurring wide-ranging ideas for how to improve and enhance the park. Eventually, all ideas the city receives will be considered by a selection committee before the architects with the best four ideas will each be given a $10,000 stipend to continue working through their concepts and even incorporate other ideas the city in the first phase of the competition. The winning design elements could see implementation through construction as early as 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Federal authorities conducted searches Friday at the home and business addresses of Democratic state Sen. Katrina Robinson, the FBI said. FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic confirmed that agents executed search warrants at two locations in Memphis. They are listed as addresses for Robinson’s residence and her nursing school, Healthcare Institute Inc. The FBI declined to discuss any additional details of the searches and the U.S. attorney’s office in Memphis said it “will not comment on the nature or progress of any FBI activities before charges are publicly filed.” No one responded Friday to a knock on the door of the school, which sits in a strip mall in southeast Memphis. Robinson didn’t immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. Her legislative office forwarded a request to a Senate Democratic Caucus spokesman. “We’ve been made aware of the investigation and have received no indication that it relates to the legislature or her legislative service,”said Brandon Puttbrese, spokesman for the Senate Democratic Caucus. “Because the investigation is ongoing, we will not be making additional statements and will defer any further questions to Sen. Robinson’s attorney.” Puttbrese also said the caucus’ thoughts are with Robinson and her family. Robinson was elected to the state Senate out of a Memphis district in 2018. Edward L. Stanton II of Butler Snow LLP emailed a statement saying only that he had been retained by Robinson “in connection with today’s events.” The school’s website said it received a $1.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a certified nursing assistant program focused on geriatric populations and educational programs. The school was founded in January 2015. Its certified nursing assistant program was introduced that July. The school also includes phlebotomy and electrocardiographic technician instruction.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Saba: A man fatally stabbed three people, including a 13-year-old girl, Friday before leading officers on a car chase and eventually being arrested, police said. Sheriff’s deputies in San Saba, a community of about 3,000 people 100 miles northwest of Austin, received a call around 4:30 a.m. from an 18-year-old woman who said she was one of four people stabbed inside a home, said Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Officers arrived to find a 62-year-old man, a 44-year-old woman and the girl dead, Washko said. He could not provide the names of the victims or the 22-year-old suspect. He also said it’s unclear how they are connected and that no motive is known at this point. The Texas Rangers were investigating. The girl was a seventh-grade student at a local school, which was open and offering counseling, said San Saba Independent School District Superintendent Wayne Kelly. “It’s hit us pretty hard, “ Kelly said. ”When there are only 200 kids in the junior high they tend to know each other.” Kelly described the stabbings as a “domestic situation” but said he could not elaborate. He declined to name the student. Moments after the stabbings, Washko said, the suspect fled in a car belonging to one of the victims. Police gave chase and followed him for 20 miles into the city of Goldthwaite, where he crashed into the wall of a senior citizen center and was arrested, he said. No one, including the suspect, was injured in the crash. Anthony Wayne Pierce was being held Friday in the Mills County jail in connection to the stabbings, jail employee Disa Purcell said. She said the 22-year-old is charged with aggravated assault on a public servant and evading arrest, and that more charges could be filed. The woman who survived the stabbing was hospitalized in critical condition, Washko said.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A proposed public park and nature reserve on the shores of Utah Lake would provide restoration habitat for ospreys, bald eagles and waterfowl, as well as walking trails, fishing spots and bird-watching towers. The 1,000-acre park would be nestled between Provo, Orem and Vineyard on land where Ute Chief Colorow Ignacio Ouray Walkara once brought his tribe to hunt and fish, the Daily Herald newspaper in Provo reported last week. A coalition of 25 government entities, civic groups and private landowners are working on a proposal they’re calling the Walkara Way Project. They plan to ask state lawmakers for $5.6 million for the project. The park has been discussed for a long time and would be a great place for families to enjoy nature, said Doug Robins, assistant director of the Provo Parks and Recreation Department. The plans call for 2.8 miles of trails, towers so people can watch bald eagles, and fishing areas and picnic areas. The trails would connect with other regional trail systems. The area where the park and preserve would be created is commonly known as the Powell Slough. Jake Holdaway, whose family has owned much of the land, said his family will get cattle grazing rights for perpetuity. He said that cows are the best way to keeping weeds from overgrowing. Taxpayer money is now used to mow the weeds or spray them with weed killer. Holdaway is planning on building an education center for children.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: Concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration that a five-story hotel planned for the Burlington International Airport could interfere with the airport’s radar system is forcing developers to relocate the proposed hotel. The FAA’s objection came as officials were preparing to begin construction of the hotel, planned for near the entrance to the South Burlington airport. Airport planners are now hoping to build the $14 million hotel just north of the airport’s parking garage on what is now a parking lot. MyNBC5.com reported the new site is larger, allowing for a slightly larger hotel with about 110 rooms, conference space and a limited service bar and restaurant. Airport officials said they hope for expedited approval from the FAA and local design review boards in order to begin construction this summer.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy said a reduction in fuel rates should save its Virginia customers an average of $6 a month later this year under a new proposal. The state’s largest electricity supplier announced Friday that a proposed fuel rate adjustment would result in roughly a 5% reduction in the average residential bill. Industrial customers would see an even greater rate drop of about 10% because the fuel rate makes up a bigger part of a typical industrial bill. The reduction would go into effect May 1 if approved by the State Corporation Commission. Dominion said that improved efficiency at its natural gas plants and increased solar generation are fueling the rate drop.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Spring chinook salmon could return on the Columbia River in the second-lowest numbers in 21 years, according to Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife. This year’s forecasted return of 81,700 upriver spring chinook is up 12% from last year’s return of 73,100, which was the lowest since 1999, the News Tribune in Tacoma reported Sunday. The record low return was just 12,000 fish in 1995. The projected return this year is just 43% of the 10-year average for chinook returning to hatcheries and spawning areas upriver from the Bonneville Dam. Poor ocean conditions continue to play a significant role in lower projected returns, said Ryan Lothrop, Columbia River policy coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. New fishing regulations for the Columbia River – from about 6 miles below the The Dalles Dam upstream to the Oregon and Washington state line above McNary Dam – set the season at April 1 through May 5. Anglers can retain either two hatchery steelhead or a hatchery chinook and a hatchery steelhead per day. Hatchery fish have a clipped adipose fin, which is just above the tail fin. Barbless hooks will be required. The expected harvest is about 340 adult chinook above the Bonneville Dam and 2,500 below it. Fishing regulations have yet to be set for this year for spring chinook on the Snake River, but the catch is expected to be similarly constrained.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: President Donald Trump has increased the federal share of costs to help West Virginia recover from floods that ravaged the state in June 2016. Gov. Jim Justice’s office said Friday that Trump approved his request to increase the federal share from 75% to 90% for public assistance projects. A recent award of $131.7 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to rebuild two Nicholas County schools helped the state meet the threshold for a cost-share increase, the governor’s office said. Covered costs include emergency expenses, debris removal and infrastructure repair. The increase falls under a major disaster declaration by former President Barack Obama in 2016 after the floods killed 23 people and damaged hundreds of buildings in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOnalaska:Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, will stop in Wisconsin for a campaign event in March. The Pences will be in Onalaska, near La Crosse, at noon March 5 for a “Women for Trump” event at the Stoney Creek Hotel and Conference Center, 3060 S. Kinney Coulee Road. They will also appear later that day at an event in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mike Pence held a rally last month at the Wisconsin State Capitol to promote private voucher and charter schools.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Yellowstone National Park plans to replace dozens of decades-old trailers used by park workers, part of an initiative to upgrade employee housing. About half of the Yellowstone’s 800 employees live in park housing, according to park spokeswoman Morgan Warthin. She described the quality of the accommodations as “fair to poor.” Over the next two years, park administrators plan to replace 64 trailers built between 1960 and 1983 with cabin-style modular houses. The number of new houses has not been determined. They would be placed in already-developed areas. The park also plans to add new housing, rehabilitate historic homes in Fort Yellowstone and other areas, and upgrade 150 nontrailer housing units, including with new flooring and better insulation and heating systems. Warthin told Montana Public Radio that there’s not enough housing, and the housing crunch hurts workforce recruitment as park visitation has jumped 45% since the year 2000. Costs for the work will run into the tens of millions of dollars, with funding coming from 2020 federal appropriations legislation, Yellowstone administrators said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/04/robot-hostesses-veggie-booze-civil-death-news-around-states/39654047/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville: A sheriff says jail inmates were caught making some truly “disgusting” alcohol out of fermenting vegetables. News outlets report it turned up when dozens of officers conducted a shakedown for contraband Monday at the Autauga Metro Jail. Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger says it was the first time he’d seen vegetables being used to make alcohol. He says the jail stopped serving inmates fruit years ago because they made wine with it. Sedinger says searchers also found an electronic cigarette altered to be used as a tattoo gun, as well as dice fashioned from the plastic ball that’s in bottles of roll on deodorant. The sheriff says inmates won’t be punished for the contraband. He just wants to remind them that he’s watching the jail closely.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials and residents of a remote island are cheering the death of a wild rat. A Norway rat that likely was carried by ship was spotted last year on St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea. The Anchorage Daily News reports the island is an internationally known breeding habitat for millions of birds that lay eggs on rocks and tundra. Wildlife officials say an infestation of rats could devastate the bird population. A local wildlife conservation agency and federal officials assembled a team that set up baited rat traps. The rat avoided capture for 10 months but was found dead Sunday by a visiting bird watcher. Monitoring for other rats will continue.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Six itsy-bitsy black-footed ferrets have been born through the Phoenix Zoo’s recovery program. The litter from first-time mom Mandolin arrived two weeks ago. Mandolin will care for them for the next few months at the zoo, which has one of only six breeding facilities in the world for this particular endangered species. In the fall, specialists will determine which of the ferret babies – known as kits – will go to breeding facilities to become future parents and which will be released into the wild. Kits from this litter that are ultimately released will first go to the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado to prepare them for survival in the wild. Over 400 black-footed ferrets have been born at the Phoenix Zoo under the recovery program.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Finance officials say the state has ended the fiscal year with a $295 million budget surplus, nearly $74 million of which will go toward highway needs. The Department of Finance and Administration said Tuesday that the state’s net available revenue collection for the fiscal year totaled $5.9 billion, $426.5 million higher than the previous year and $231.2 million above forecast. Arkansas already had a $64 million surplus that was included in the state’s budget. The fiscal year ended Sunday. Twenty-five percent of the surplus will be transferred to the state Department of Transportation, while the rest will go toward reserve funds for other needs. The department says the state ended the year above forecast because of high growth in individual and corporate income tax collections.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A gigantic mansion built in 1991 for the late producer Aaron Spelling and his widow has been sold for $119.75 million. The Los Angeles Times says the sale that closed Tuesday is the highest home price ever in Los Angeles County. Set on 4.7 acres in Holmby Hills, the 56,600-square-foot chateau is the largest home in the city. The unidentified buyer was represented by a Beverly Hills real estate firm. Spelling produced such TV series as “Charlie’s Angels,” “Dynasty,” “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Melrose Place.” After his death in 2006, his widow, Candy, sold the mansion for $85 million to Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone. She made modifications, and the home now has 123 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: Wildlife researchers say an elk traveled more than 250 miles across the state to give birth. The Steamboat Pilot and Today reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials placed a collar on the elk cow known as R190 near the town of Maybell in late March. Officials tracked the elk as she zigzagged east and crossed the Continental Divide. She gave birth last month in North Park, a large mountain valley in north-central Colorado. State wildlife researcher Nathaniel Rayl says the distance the elk traveled was significant, but elk don’t really have average migration distance. They may travel great distances one year but stay put the next. The elk was equipped with a GPS collar as part of a study tracking the survival of elk calves.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStafford Springs: A recently reopened mill in the state is helping the military bring back old-school Army uniforms by providing the high-quality woolen fabric used in their manufacture. American Woolen Company Inc. in Stafford Springs is gearing up to provide high-end wool to make the Army green uniforms that will be worn by soldiers and officers and that echo similar outfits worn by the military more than a half-century ago. Jacob Harrison Long, chief executive officer of the company, says the idea of the new uniform is to boost morale by harkening back to a time when military men and women were “very well-dressed.” Long said he bought the 19th-century mill in 2014 after the previous owner closed down and has hired back many of the previous owner’s workers.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: At the Robot Captain Crabs Cajun Seafood & Bar, new hostess Charlotte seems eager to show customers to their seats. “Please follow me to the table,” she says in a polite, girlish voice. Dressed in a purple uniform with a hat that looks like one worn by an old-fashioned bellhop, Charlotte waits until patrons are seated to say their server will be with them shortly, and she hopes they enjoy their meal. If someone bumps into her, Charlotte says “excuse me” and rolls out of their way. Charlotte, who seems like the perfect employee, is a robot, one of five now “working” at the new restaurant near Newark, where futuristic sci-fi meets rustic seafood. Owner Guang Chen says he believes the establishment could be one of the first in the nation to use robot servers and hosts. Though humans also greet customers and take orders, there are two “hostesses” and three “food runners” that can spin in circles and “talk” to customers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: City officials are pushing back against an unsubstantiated claim by President Donald Trump that he orchestrated a purge of homeless people there to shield visiting foreign dignitaries from having to see them. The claim was among a series of falsehoods leveled by Trump in recent days as he has seized on the homeless epidemic. He has also claimed, wrongly, that homelessness is a novel issue and suggested that local officials have deliberately exacerbated the problem for political gain. “It’s a phenomena that started two years ago. It’s disgraceful,” Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. He then suggested he had done something to end homelessness in Washington, even though thousands still sleep on the streets of the nation’s capital and in its shelters, a claim that left D.C. officials baffled.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Shores: A Miami-area couple whose front-yard vegetable garden prompted a six-year legal battle with their village has held a ceremonial replanting of veggies under a new law legalizing such gardens statewide. Hermine Ricketts and husband Tom Carroll planted jalapenos, green bell peppers and other vegetables this week when the bill went into effect. Miami Shores previously made such front-yard gardens punishable by a daily fine of $50 on grounds they were unsightly and violated zoning codes. Miami Shores told Ricketts to remove her garden in 2013, prompting their lengthy lawsuit. An appeals court backed the village, but then the Legislature stepped in to legalize the gardens. Republican state Sen. Rob Bradley sponsored the bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The case of whether hackers may have tampered with elections in Georgia has taken another strange turn. Nearly two years ago, state lawyers in a closely watched election integrity lawsuit told the judge they intended to subpoena the FBI for the forensic image, or digital snapshot, the agency made of a crucial server before state election officials quietly wiped it clean. Election watchdogs want to examine the data to see if there might have been tampering, given that the server was left exposed by a gaping security hole for more than half a year. A new email obtained by the Associated Press says state officials never did issue the subpoena, even though the judge had ordered that evidence be preserved, including from the FBI. The FBI data is central to activists’ challenge to Georgia’s highly questioned, centrally administered elections system, which lacks an auditable paper trail and was run at the time by Gov. Brian Kemp, then Georgia’s secretary of state.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials say the state’s last remaining native lowland bog is thriving again following a more than decadelong restoration effort. The Garden Island reports conservation groups have worked to restore native plants to the Kanaele Bog on Kauai after it became overrun with nonnative weeds and feral pigs. The Nature Conservancy signed a management agreement in 2003 and built a fence around 58 acres to keep out the pigs. They then pulled tens of thousands of weeds. The conservancy’s director of the Kauai forest program, Melissa Fisher, says the bog now has 95% plant coverage with 97% native plants. The bog is home to unique flowering plants, native grasses and sedges, as well as Hawaii’s only carnivorous plant – the mikinalo.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials are revising a 1999 plan as part of a strategy to recover endangered white sturgeon in the Kootenai River in northern Idaho and western Montana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments through July 29 on the draft recovery plan revisions released last week. The document reflects advancements in understanding of white sturgeon and changes that have taken place over the past two decades to help the fish rebound. Sturgeon have been around since the dinosaurs. They have armorlike scales and in the Kootenai River system have been recorded up to 10 feet long. But the population has struggled since the completion of Libby Dam in Montana in 1974, which altered the natural cycle of the river.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state saw an eighth straight year of record tourism growth in 2018, attracting more than 117 million visitors in 2018. U.S. Travel Association numbers released by the state this week show visitors to Illinois spent $41.7 billion over the previous year. That’s a more than 5% increase in visitor spending over 2017. Tourism generated $3.3 billion in state and local tax revenue, a more than 7% jump. Tourism was a boon jobs-wise too. The state says travel and tourism support more than 342,000 jobs last year. That’s up 5,200 jobs from 2017. The Illinois Office of Tourism credits the record numbers to successful marketing efforts. Gov. J.B. Pritzker called tourism “an integral part of our state’s economy.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State wildlife officials say an Asian carp species that poses a serious threat to mussel populations is advancing closer to the state’s waterways. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says two black carp were captured last month in the Ohio River about 10 miles downstream of Indiana’s state line. Black carp feed on mollusks. They pose a serious threat to Indiana’s native mussel species, many of which are listed as endangered or of special concern. Black carp are native to Asia. They’ve been moving throughout the Mississippi River basin since escaping from captivity decades ago. The DNR asks anyone who catches a suspected black carp to keep it, note its location, cool it on ice once it’s dead and report it to the DNR by calling 1-866-663-9684.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Biofuel plants in the state are adding milkweed and other native plants to their properties so monarch butterflies can fuel up during the annual migration. WHO-TV reports that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the monarch butterfly could warrant protection if something isn’t done to boost its population. That’s why the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association started its project called the “Monarch Fueling Station” in December 2018. The Renewable Energy Group plant situated on the northeast side of Newton is one of the latest ethanol and biodiesel plants to join the cause. “It’s a little bit of work to begin with, and it’s a small amount of maintenance,” plant manager Phil Abels says. But “the value that will be received goes way beyond any effort.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Drivers can no longer be charged with a crime for refusing a field sobriety test under a new state law. The Wichita Eagle reports that a change in state law that took effect Monday means police can’t ticket suspected drivers for not taking one. But refusal to comply comes with a yearlong license suspension, as long as the longest suspension for failing a breathalyzer or blood test. Drivers who refuse to be tested can still be prosecuted for a DUI based on other evidence. The decision to strike the law making it a separate violation comes amid court rulings on whether motorists driving on streets and highways give implied consent to sobriety tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A fire destroyed a massive Jim Beam warehouse filled with about 45,000 barrels of aging bourbon, sparking worries that runoff whiskey seeping into nearby waterways could kill fish. Firefighters from four counties responded to the blaze that erupted late Tuesday. It sent flames shooting into the night sky and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. The warehouse was a total loss. Looking to reassure consumers of Jim Beam bourbon, Beam Suntory indicated it amounted to a drop of the iconic brand’s total aging inventory. No injuries were reported, Woodford County Emergency Management Director Drew Chandler said. The fire was contained but was allowed to burn until midday Wednesday, he said. State officials warned recreational users on the Kentucky River that runoff would result in water discoloration, foaming and an odor.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State wildlife officials are upping the price they’ll pay hunters who catch a large aquatic rodent known for harming marsh ecosystems. Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has increased the bounty from $5 to $6 after fewer nutrias have been caught than in the past. Nutrias are webbed-toed, buck-toothed rodents that are in between the size of muskrats and beavers. They’re known for nibbling on tree roots and causing erosion and damage to marshes. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports this damage has been increasing in recent years and affecting southeastern Louisiana most. Officials hope the greater sum will encourage more hunters to kill nutrias during the 2019-20 season. All they have to do to cash in is bring in the tails as proof.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: Some parts of the state are finding relief from a rash-causing species of moth because of the cool and rainy spring. The browntail moth’s caterpillar is an invasive nuisance that causes itchy rashes and respiratory problems. But the Portland Press Herald reports damp weather in the late spring helped spur the spread of a fungus that kills the caterpillars. Scientists predicted earlier in spring that browntail moths would be especially bad this year. But the Maine Forest Service said Tuesday that field surveys have shown collapses of the pest due to the fungus. Such collapses have happened in communities including Arrowsic, Camden, Harpswell and Turner. The caterpillar’s high season is usually mid-May through June.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A local minister is a top finalist in a nationally recognized singing competition. Joshua Copeland, 37, a praise and worship leader and minister at United Faith Churches of Deliverance, joins 19 other talents from across the nation and world on BET’s gospel-themed show, “Sunday Best.” Joshua is also the son of Bishop George Copeland. The premier of the show’s ninth season Sunday marked its return to television following a four-year hiatus. In a recorded interview, Copeland opened up about his experience growing up as a pastor’s son and being bullied in school because of his weight. “Being a PK has its challenges. Everybody feels like a pastor’s kid can do no wrong. He’s supposed to be the perfect kid. I talked to my parents a lot about it, and they always tell us, ‘We’re not perfect, so we’re not expecting you to be perfect, but we’re going to strive to do what God calls us to do,’ ” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAquinnah: The Martha’s Vineyard estate of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is on the market for $65 million. Red Gate Farm in Aquinnah was a sheep farm and hunting cabin when Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1979. She added a more than 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom main residence and a two-story, four-bedroom guest house. The estate, which includes more than a mile of private beachfront, also has several other buildings. The property is listed by Christie’s International Real Estate. It has been maintained by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of Kennedy Onassis and President John F. Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy said in a statement that the estate was a perfect expression of her mother’s “romantic and adventurous spirit,” and she hopes that “a new family will treasure this place as we have for three generations.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Contemporary Motown artist Ne-Yo will join the Temptations, Martha Reeves and others from the label’s classic era during a concert marking the 60th anniversary of the recording company. The Motown Museum has set Sept. 22 for Hitsville Honors: Celebrating Berry Gordy & 60 Years of Motown, at Detroit’s Orchestra Hall. Others performing as part of the tribute to the company and its founder include the Four Tops, Mary Wilson, Big Sean and Kem. The concert is part of a three-day celebration dubbed Motown 60 Weekend. Other events include the Motown Gospel Concert on Sept. 21. The label paved a way for the Motown Museum to be built in Detroit. It was the first headquarters where Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Miracles and others recorded before Motown decamped to California in 1972.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Norie, a 2-year-old golden retriever, is the newest staffer at the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office. She’s the latest in more than 200 so-called courthouse dogs around the country that are being used to help take some of the stress out of the place and help people work through the legal system. Tami McConkey, director of the victim witness and community services division for the prosecutor’s office, tells Minnesota Public Radio News that dogs help calm people down and help give them confidence to report what happened. Norie is believed to be the first courthouse dog in the state. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi says prosecutors and others understand the justice system can add to the trauma of crime. He says Norie may help ease that burden.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal lawsuit says the state is violating free-speech rights by banning makers of plant-based foods from using terms such as “meatless meatballs” and “vegan bacon.” The lawsuit was filed this week by the Plant Based Foods Association and the Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co., which makes vegan products and sells them in many states, including Mississippi. It was filed the same day the Magnolia State enacted a new law that bans plant-based products from being labeled as meat. A similar lawsuit was filed in Missouri last year by the Oregon-based Tofurky Co., which makes vegetarian food products, and The Good Food Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for alternatives to meat. A Missouri law made it a misdemeanor to label plant-based products as meat. Meat producers have been pushing to protect meat terminology.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City Public Library has forgiven $250,000 in overdue fines and will no longer charge late fees on any materials. The Kansas City Star reports that the changes were announced last Friday at the library’s southeast branch. Mayor-elect Quinton Lucas said the decision was made to give more people access to the city’s libraries. About 9,000 patrons with suspended library cards will regain access to library resources. Library director Crosby Kemper III says the fee change will increase children’s use of the library system. More than 450 libraries in the U.S. have done away with fines, but Kemper says the Kansas City Public Library is the first major library in the region to do so.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A nonprofit foundation that raises money for projects in Yellowstone National Park has about $4.35 million in debt. John Walda, interim CEO of Yellowstone Forever, told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle the organization made faulty revenue projections when it was formed by combining the Yellowstone Association and the Yellowstone Park Foundation in 2016. Yellowstone Forever invested in staff, buildings and technology based on the inaccurate projections. Yellowstone Forever has provided $18 million to the park for projects but will reduce its cash support and hold some jobs open as it works to get back on better financial footing. There have been layoffs, and several employees have resigned, including CEO Heather White last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nBeatrice: A biodiesel plant is ceasing production in this southeast Nebraska city. Flint Hills Resources announced this week that the Duonix Beatrice plant is being idled indefinitely. The Beatrice Daily Sun reports the plant processes corn oil and greases into biodiesel. The prices of soybeans used by most other biodiesel producers are so low that the Duonix plant was put at a competitive disadvantage. Flint Hills does not expect those conditions to change. Duonix Beatrice began operation in 2016 and is a joint venture of Flint Hills Resources and Benefuel Inc. The plant was built in 2008 but wasn’t finished and never operated until purchased and refitted for biodiesel production. Officials say severance packages will be offered to the fewer than 40 plant employees.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada Highway Patrol says passengers must be alive in order to be counted as occupants in cars using the high-occupancy vehicle lane. The reminder was prompted by a traffic stop Monday involving a hearse traveling on the carpool lane on Interstate 15 in Las Vegas. A trooper pulled over the hearse that was transporting a dead body. The agency says the hearse driver assumed the body in the back counted toward the requirement of two or more occupants for the lane. The trooper let the driver off with a warning and advised him to move out of the lane. The agency says only living, breathing people can be counted for the HOV lane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Durham: Partnership efforts have resulted in the preservation of 2,000 acres overlooking Merrymeeting Lake as a community forest. The Birch Ridge Community Forest in New Durham rises over the lake with views of Mount Molly and Mount Bet. It filters clean water to the lake and Coldrain Pond. The forest offers 13 miles of trails for hikers, cross-country skiers, hunters and birders. And it offers critical habitat for wide-ranging species such as moose, bear, deer and bobcat. The forest’s protection was helped by donations from community members and the town; grants from the U.S. Forest Service and New Hampshire Land and Community Heritage Investment Program; and the state Department of Environmental Services. A community event celebrating the conservation is planned for July 13.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Rutherford: Officials have finally set an opening date for a massive retail and entertainment center in the Meadowlands. The long-delayed American Dream project will open Oct. 25. The announcement was made Wednesday by its developer, Triple Five. American Dream will feature 3 million square feet of retail, dining and entertainment, including more than 450 stores and restaurants. The project includes an amusement park, an indoor ski slope, an indoor ice skating rink, an indoor water park and more. The project has been plagued by financial problems since the first contract was awarded in 2003. The immense structure, once called “the ugliest damn building in New Jersey” by former Gov. Chris Christie, has sat unfinished between MetLife Stadium and the New Jersey Turnpike for years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State health officials are predicting one of the worst mosquito seasons in decades thanks to wetter weather earlier this year. KOB-TV reports health officials believe the mosquito population and the threat of West Nile virus are on the rise as monsoon season approaches. Mark DiMenna of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department says the city is preparing for a bad mosquito season, the likes of which they haven’t seen in 15 years. Standing water along arroyos, ditches, wetlands and even the side of the road is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. New Mexico’s largest city uses larval control through water management and source reduction and with the use of environmentally friendly, EPA-approved chemicals.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: A key local official says hosting the Woodstock 50 anniversary festival on short notice “could pose a significant challenge.” A mass gathering permit application for the Vernon Downs harness track and casino in central New York was recently filed after operators of the original festival site pulled out last month. Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente released a statement Tuesday noting the challenge of preparing for the health and safety of residents and concertgoers with the event just over a month away. The Woodstock festival has faced a series of setbacks, including the losses of a financial partner, a production company and its original site. Vernon Downs has said it can host up to 65,000 people, far fewer than the 150,000 planned for Watkins Glen International.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Vehicle owners now have another option from which to choose when it comes to the state’s regularly priced license plate. The Division of Motor Vehicles began offering a third standard plate this week. Previously motorists could choose between the “First in Flight” background or the “First in Freedom” theme, which refers to pre-Revolutionary War events. Now they can pick a plate with the national motto “In God We Trust” at the top and the state motto “To Be Rather Than to Seem” near the bottom. A 2018 law directed that the DMV create the new option. The agency says current vehicle owners can request the new plate at no additional charge when they renew their car registration. They’ll pay a standard charge if it’s requested at another time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nJamestown: The National Buffalo Museum says the herd’s white bull bison has died from injuries suffered in an accidental fall into a ravine. Dakota Miracle was 13 years old. The museum says the bison’s health was compromised due to a genetic condition resulting in lack of pigmentation. That caused Dakota Miracle to have poor eyesight, a factor believed to have led to his fall. NewsDakota reports museum board president Don Williams and executive director Ilana Xinos found Dakota Miracle deceased during a routine herd and pasture inspection. Dakota Miracle was the son of White Cloud, an albino bison that lived with the museum’s herd for almost two decades. The National Buffalo Museum’s mission is to educate the public on the cultural and historical significance of the American bison.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: If your summer plans involve traveling through the Buckeye State, and you’re still a fan of paper maps, it’s time you met Bruce Hull. He’s been injecting visual flair, handy information and a hidden bit of his own family history into Ohio’s road maps for almost two decades. Hull’s artistry has appeared on millions of maps helping drivers navigate the state, which has the nation’s fourth-busiest highway system. As a layout design artist with the Ohio Department of Transportation since 1989, Hull has creative control over the map’s look and feel. One year, his design resembled the front of a refrigerator packed with photos of Ohio attractions. He always works to make featured venues reflect the diversity of the state’s racial and ethnic groups; its rural, urban and natural landscapes; and its cultural and recreational offerings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Medicaid agency is warning its SoonerCare members to keep current their address on file with the agency or risk losing their health care benefits. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority sent out a public reminder Wednesday of the new rule that was signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt last week. The agency says it intends to launch outreach efforts through social media and through outbound phone calls to SoonerCare recipients after hours and on weekends. Agency officials say the new rule is needed to comply with federal guidelines. But advocates for the poor have criticized the policy, saying low-income people move more frequently, and many members will be wrongfully cut from the programs. About 20% of Oklahoma’s population, more than two-thirds of them children, is enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Despite broad support, a measure that would put the state’s controversial jury system before voters died in the Oregon Senate during the final days of the 2019 legislative session. Oregon is the only state in the country that allows for convictions via non-unanimous juries in criminal felony cases. House Joint Resolution 10 would have put before voters on the November 2020 ballot a proposed change to the Oregon Constitution. If passed, it would have mandated that criminal jury verdicts be unanimous, as is the case with the federal government and all other 49 states. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that with the measure dead, the state’s legal community turns to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will take up non-unanimous juries during its next term.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf has signed legislation that his office says clarifies the options for whom school districts and private schools can hire as armed security guards, although Wolf’s administration says it bars districts from allowing teachers to be armed. The bill also expands training requirements for armed school officers. It says schools can hire armed security guards on contract, as long as they meet certain certification standards. It also expands the definition of a school officer to include a county sheriff or deputy sheriff. Wolf’s office says schools were already employing both. In a statement, Wolf says teachers cannot be considered security personnel and aren’t authorized to be armed in schools under any law in Pennsylvania. Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, saying allowing more guns into school won’t solve school shootings.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the constitutionality of a state statute that punishes inmates serving life in prison with “civil death.” The ACLU’s Rhode Island chapter filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two inmates. A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island attorney general says the office is reviewing it and can’t comment on pending litigation. Rhode Island is one of the few places where inmates serving life in prison are deemed dead, by state statute, with respect to property rights, marriage and other civil rights, as if their natural death took place when they were convicted. Most civil death laws in the United States have been repealed or successfully challenged in court. Most countries never adopted the practice. Rhode Island’s statute from 1909 is still enforced.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville Zoo’s newest giraffe has arrived. Autumn, a female Masai giraffe, went into labor Sunday night and gave birth just before 10:30p.m., according to a release from the city. The giraffe was up and walking within an hour and nursing soon after, according to the release. The calf is a 6-foot-1-inch male weighing 165 pounds, the release says. The calf is expected to access the giraffe exhibit Wednesday with his mom. Kiden, the baby’s sister, will be allowed to join Autumn and the calf Thursday. Miles, the giraffe’s father, is separated from the family so the baby can bond with Autumn without interruption, according to the release.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A new state law effective this week eliminates the need for a permit to carry a concealed pistol. South Dakota is the 14th state to enact such a law for both residents and visitors. Pennington County Capt. Marty Graves tells KOTA-TV he thinks it’s a good thing for gun owners. Graves says it will lighten the work load for his office because it will no longer issue the permits and collect the fees. Before the new law took effect this week, people could be charged with a misdemeanor if they carried a concealed pistol or had one concealed in a vehicle without a permit.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Library & Archives has launched a digital project that uses pension records to map out where soldiers lived before and after the Revolutionary War. State Librarian and Archivist Chuck Sherrill announced the Patriot Paths online initiative at the National Genealogical Society’s recent annual convention. It helps researchers study migration patterns of soldiers born in the colonies and Europe who ultimately traveled to Tennessee. About 2,000 pension files exist for the thousands of veterans who came to Tennessee after the war. Most soldiers weren’t eligible for pensions until they were in their 80s, so it’s a smaller subset of those who served. Library workers used the records to find dates and places where soldiers were born, married, enlisted and died. The information was coordinated with GIS mapping.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A new law legalizing hemp in the state is creating problems for authorities that will likely cost millions of dollars to fix and has temporarily stopped the prosecution of some misdemeanor cases involving marijuana, hemp’s plant cousin. After the 2018 federal Farm Bill made hemp legal in the U.S., states like Texas passed legislation allowing farmers to grow it. Texas’ new law provides a specific definition of marijuana, based on its percentage of THC, the compound that gets users high. But before the new law, Texas authorities only needed to show the presence of THC in suspected marijuana. Officials say most Texas crime labs can’t test for exact amounts of THC. District attorneys in at least four Texas counties say they’ll stop accepting misdemeanor marijuana cases until the problem is fixed.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Several environmental groups are working together to shut down unauthorized trails and formalize new ones near a wildlife area in northern Utah. The Daily Herald reports dozens of volunteers gathered June 29 at the Timpanogos Wildlife Management Area in Orem to begin rehabilitating parts that have become overrun by unauthorized bike trails in recent years. Biologists have said urban development threatens habitats in the area used by deer and elk. Volunteers closed off switchbacks, broke up the soil to help vegetation grow and placed new signs directing people to designated paths. Some volunteers said they want the area to be sustainable for wildlife and trail users. The project is expected to take at least a year and will reduce total trail mileage from approximately 40 miles to 20.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Colleges System is planning for its future as it faces reduced enrollment, underfunding and other challenges and as a number of private schools go out of business. The Rutland Herald reports that a long-range planning committee is hoping to find solutions. It’s part of a project to keep the state colleges – made up of Castleton University, Community College of Vermont, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College – thriving and relevant. The office of Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding released a report earlier this month that looked at reduction of population, the low amount of state funding, and the rise of large universities offering remote education at a lower cost, among other challenges.\n\nVirginia\n\nUpperville: Three new historical markers aim to remember the philanthropic efforts of Paul Mellon. Paul Mellon was heir to the financial and industrial fortune of his father, Andrew W. Mellon. He supported universities, civic improvement projects, conservation efforts and fine-arts institutions. The markers issued by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources were set to be dedicated Thursday in Upperville. One marker highlights Paul Mellon’s life and philanthropy. Another highlights Rokeby Stables, where Mellon bred and raised champion racehorses in Fauquier County. Mellon died in 1999. A third marker highlights the work of his first wife, Mary Elizabeth Conover Mellon, whose interests led to the founding of the Bollingen Foundation and publication of the writings of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in English.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted unanimously to enable the construction of more and bigger backyard cottages in all neighborhoods while removing requirements that property owners live on site and provide off-street parking. The Seattle Times reports Councilmember Mike O’Brien and other proponents touted the new rules for accessory units passed Monday as a gentle and environmentally sustainable way to add living options in response to the city’s population growth. They say it will open up pricey neighborhoods. Proponents included urbanists, labor unions, homebuilders and the AARP. Critics of the new rules, led by the Queen Anne Community Council, warned about the changes allowing developers to replace modest older houses with up to three rental units. They say the plan would make Seattle’s low-density blocks less desirable.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says the state collected more revenue growth this fiscal year than any other year in state history. The Republican governor announced in a news release Tuesday that general revenue growth hit $511 million in the fiscal year that ended Sunday. He says the figure is due to the state taking in high amounts of consumer sales, personal income, corporate net income and severance taxes. Growth in oil and natural gas sales, as well as “enhanced construction industry activities,” contributed to the total. Justice says last fiscal year’s revenue growth is one-and-a-half times the combined growth for fiscal years 2007 to 2017.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Scientists with the state Department of Natural Resources are searching for sick snakes. Agency biologists are looking for snakes infected with snake fungal disease. SFD has the potential to devastate snake populations because it prevents snakes from effectively feeding and drinking and causes extended basking periods, leaving snakes more vulnerable to predators. The disease has been confirmed in Buffalo, Crawford, Dane, Grant, La Crosse, Outagamie, Sauk and Trempeleau counties since 2011. DNR biologists are literally turning over rocks and logs in an effort to find infected snakes and put together a more complete map of confirmed cases. DNR officials are encouraging anyone who sees a wild snake to send photos to the agency and report any snakes with unusual lumps, lesions or scabs.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first-quarter economic report shows a modest recovery, but the news came out just a day after the unexpected closure of two coal mines in Campbell County put nearly 600 people out of work. Chief economist Wenlin Liu said Tuesday that the state gained 4,400 jobs from January through March, but a lot of them are related to construction of oil and gas pipelines and wind energy projects and are therefore temporary. Liu says miners who lost their jobs with the closure of the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines are entering a job market in need of workers, but the jobs don’t pay as well. The Gillette News Record reports a bankruptcy judge on Wednesday rejected a financing proposal to keep the mines open while owners restructured debt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/04"}]}

Be sure to refresh this page often to get the latest information on how things are going.\n\nUSA TODAY will have live election results.\n\nDemocrats keep a key Senate seat\n\nFirst-term Democratic Sen. Gary Peters fended off a challenge from Republican John James, according to Fox News and NBC. The projection is good news for Democrats still attempting an increasingly narrow path to taking the Senate majority.\n\n“I am sincerely honored that the voters of Michigan have once again put their trust and confidence in me to represent them in the United States Senate,” Peters said in a statement. “As we look ahead, I am energized to keep working to move our state forward and continue putting Michigan first.”\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMichigan had been a key target of both parties but Biden ended up scoring the state after Trump won by a slim margin in 2016.\n\nThe win means Democrats will still need at least two more wins if Biden takes the White House, three more wins if Trump wins. They still have a chance to take seats in Alaska, North Carolina and two chances in Georgia, which has been solidly red for about two decades. One of the races in Georgia will go to a runoff while the others have been too close to call.\n\nBiden poised to capture 270 electoral votes\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden is one state away Wednesday from capturing the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential race, a dramatic demonstration of how rapidly the landscape of the contest changed in 24 hours.\n\nThough Biden did not secure the quick and decisive outcome some in the party had hoped for, he has edged closer to a result that many observers had predicted: A deficit on Election Day in battleground states that was slowly erased and turned into narrow leads when the crush of absentee ballots were counted.\n\nBiden won both Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, huge electoral prizes that represented the partial rebuilding of the \"blue wall\" of Democratic-leaning states that collapsed around Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe wins there left Biden standing at 264 electoral votes — just six shy of the needed 270.\n\nThe results meant that President Donald Trump has to capture all of the outstanding states, hope that the projections of a Biden win in Arizona were wrong or find a legal strategy.\n\nBiden's wins on Wednesday shifted the focus to the Southwest, specifically Nevada and Arizona. Biden has, as of 7 pm EDT, an extremely slim lead in Nevada, which was too close to call throughout Wednesday. Election officials there said they did not expect to report additional results there until Thursday.\n\nArizona, meanwhile, has become a rallying cry for Trump's team. Aides to the president have argued that the state was projected for Biden too early — that outstanding ballots would benefit Trump. State officials there were set to release new vote counts late Wednesday and into Thursday morning.\n\nPennsylvania remains a must-win for Trump, but mail-in ballots that make up the remaining votes are expected to continue heavily favor Biden and could give him an edge to carry the Keystone State. Counting in that state will continue Thursday.\n\nThe count from Alaska is outstanding, though the state is a heavy favored to go to Trump.\n\nBiden could also secure the presidency if he carries Georgia or North Carolina. Trump had leads in both of those states late Wednesday.\n\n—John Fritze and Joey Garrison\n\nConservative group to PA: Count every vote\n\nAs President Donald Trump tried to stop votes from being counted in Pennsylvania and Michigan, a conservative group that opposes Trump launched a billboard advertising campaign opposing the effort.\n\nThe more than 100 billboards across the state paid for by Republicans for the Rule of Law read: “Count Every Vote.”\n\n\"This is Civics 101,\" said Sarah Longwell, the group’s strategic director. “First the candidates make their cases to the people and ask for their votes. Then the people vote. Then the votes are counted to determine who won the election. It has worked for over 200 years, and there’s no reason to change it now.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign filed suit in Pennsylvania Wednesday to temporarily halt vote counting \"until there is meaningful transparency and Republicans can ensure all counting is done above board and by the law.\"\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump camp files with Supreme Court to overturn counting mail-in ballots received by Nov. 6 in Pennsylvania\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign on Wednesday filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and overturn a Pennsylvania state Supreme Court ruling allowing election officials to count mail-in ballots received up to three days after the election.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court had let the deadline stand in a ruling last week but left the door open to hearing a challenge if the state proved to be pivotal in the election.\n\n“That time has come,” the Trump campaign filing Wednesday says. “Given last night’s results, the vote in Pennsylvania may well determine the next President of the United States.”\n\nBallots received after the polls closed Tuesday were to be segregated from those received earlier to allow for court challenges.\n\nThe case was initially filed by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Trump campaign is now seeking to intervene in the case in its application to the nation’s highest court.\n\nThe justices has already refused to decide in Republicans’ favor twice. But Associate Justice Samuel Alito, writing for himself and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said there had not been enough time at that point to hear and decide the challenge.\n\nPennsylvania officials on Wednesday defended the state's ballot-counting process. “Pennsylvania is going to count every vote and make sure that everyone has their voice heard,\" Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"Pennsylvania is going to fight every single attempt to disenfranchise voters and continue to administer a free and fair election. Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without intimidation or attacks. These attempts to subvert the democratic process are disgraceful.”\n\n— Donovan Slack, USA TODAY, and Crissa Shoemaker DeBree, Bucks County Courier Times, USA TODAY Network\n\nBiden wins Michigan\n\nJoe Biden has taken Michigan, perhaps the state he most needed to take back from President Donald Trump in his bid to become the nation’s 46th president.\n\nBiden overcame a hefty Trump lead on Wednesday in the “blue wall” state, which along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had crumbled in 2016, as more absentee ballots were counted.\n\nWell more than 5 million ballots were cast in the state, a record that surpassed the 2008 vote won by President Barack Obama. More than 60% of the votes were cast by absentee ballot.\n\nTurnout in Detroit topped 50%, the highest in two decades.\n\nAbout 28,000 voters took advantage of same-day voter registration, which was offered in Michigan for the first time in a presidential election.\n\nFour years ago, Michigan was Trump’s narrowest win over Hillary Rodham Clinton, with a margin of less than 1 percentage point. He was the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state since 1988.\n\nTrump tried to repeat his upset in part by holding his final campaign rally in Grand Rapids, just as he had four years ago.\n\n“This is a poll,” Trump said in reference to supporters who stayed past midnight to see him there Monday night. “This is not the crowd of somebody who’s going to lose this state.”\n\nBut Trump wasn’t the last national candidate in the state. Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spent part of Tuesday in Detroit, where Biden had campaigned with former President Barack Obama on Saturday.\n\nBiden reminded voters that the Obama administration rescued the automobile industry with government investment after the 2008 recession. By contrast this year, the number of manufacturing jobs in Michigan was down before the pandemic, and unemployment remains stubbornly high.\n\nThe pandemic and economic crisis were important issues in Michigan, where thousands have protested Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s ordered restrictions to curb the virus. Trump openly fought with Whitmer over the pandemic and downplayed the threat she faced from an extremist group's plot to kidnap her. Whitmer accused Trump of \"stoking distrust and fomenting anger.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: ‘We will be the winners’\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden said Wednesday he expects to win enough states to win the White House, but he wouldn’t declare victory yet.\n\n“I’m not here to declare that we’ve won,” Biden told reporters at the Chase Center in Wilmington accompanied by his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris. “But I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”\n\nWhile votes are still being counted, Biden cited a 20,000 vote margin in Wisconsin and a 35,000 vote margin in Michigan, which he said were the same or larger than President Donald Trump won those states in 2016.\n\n“I feel very good about Pennsylvania,” the Scranton native said because the remaining votes are absentee, which he’s been winning by 78%.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden wins Wisconsin\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden has won the state of Wisconsin, a key “blue wall” state that had crushed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s hopes in 2016.\n\nBiden’s win in Wisconsin, which came a day after polls closed and as absentee ballots from the Democrat-heavy city of Milwaukee poured in, represented a major shift in the tight race toward 270 Electoral College votes between Biden and President Donald Trump, widening the former vice president's already growing path to the White House.\n\nBiden overtook Trump Wednesday when Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 outstanding absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Late returns from Green Bay and Kenosha only added to his slender lead. The state, with 10 Electoral College votes, had long been considered a top tier battleground with the potential to give huge momentum to Biden or Trump.\n\nIf Biden also captures Michigan and keeps his lead in Nevada, it will allow him to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House even if he loses Pennsylvania, where votes were still being counted in a close contest.\n\nIn a closing crescendo of campaign travel, Trump made five trips to Wisconsin in the final month of the race amid a surging of coronavirus cases. His last stop, in Kenosha, came the day before the election.\n\nBiden made his only October visit to the state on the Friday before the election. He outspent Trump heavily in the home stretch on TV in Milwaukee and Green Bay, the most important media markets.\n\nTurnout in the state topped 3.2 million – the most votes ever cast in a Wisconsin election. At least 71% of the state's voting-age adults cast ballots – the highest turnout rate ever after the 2004 election.\n\nIn the end, the result was much tighter than polling had predicted. For much of Wednesday morning, Biden led by a mere 20,000 votes, close to Trump’s winning margin in 2016. Polling conducted before the election had regularly shown Biden with a near double digit lead in the state.\n\nIt was the fourth time in six presidential elections that Wisconsin was decided by less than a percentage point, and the sixth time in eight presidential races that the winner failed to reach 50%.\n\nWisconsin was not only at the epicenter of the presidential race. It was also at the center of the two national crises that shaped the campaign's final months: the pandemic, and the clash over policing and protest. Its coronavirus caseload rose faster than any other top battleground.\n\nDemocrats were devastated by the loss there in 2016, marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump mercilessly mocked Clinton for not campaigning frequently enough there, suggesting she had taken it for granted at her peril.\n\n– Craig Gilbert and John Fritze\n\nTrump campaign says it filed lawsuit in Michigan to 'halt counting'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign said Wednesday it filed a lawsuit in a Michigan state court to \"halt counting\" ballots in the state until the Republicans could gain access to the tallying process.\n\nThe lawsuit, which the campaign did not immediately make available for review, appears to be one of the first filed in the wake of tight contests in several battleground states.\n\n\"We have filed suit today in the Michigan Court of Claims to halt counting until meaningful access has been granted,\" Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. \"We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.\"\n\nThe prospects of the lawsuit are not known.\n\n– John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nWho turned out for Trump? Similar to 2016 but ...\n\nBased on early election results, county demographic data largely reflects – and even intensifies – trends from Trump’s election four years ago. Trump solidified his dominance in the poorest and least educated counties while losing ground in highly educated and high income areas.\n\nWith several swing states still counting ballots, Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads the popular vote and remains ahead in electoral college votes as well. Data analyzed by USA TODAY offers insights into how various groups voted beyond information from exit polling, like the Associated Press’ VoteCast exit survey of voters.\n\nBiden so far has fared better than 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the top 300 counties with residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher, claiming 12% more of those counties and nearly 1 million more votes – receiving 60% of the vote in all.\n\nTrump won the bottom 300 counties for education in each election, this year increasing his reach there to 71% of votes, up from 68%.\n\nEven with economics top of mind for many Americans, voting results based on income and employment status followed similar trends to 2016.\n\nThe top 10% of counties by median income moved away from Trump. Four years ago, he won nearly two-thirds of them compared to 57% of those counties thus far in 2020. The counties with the lowest incomes, meanwhile, moved in his favor by 3 percentage points.\n\nSome aspects bucked what might have been expected fallout from the coronavirus among those most affected.\n\nCounties with the highest unemployment rates in August cast nearly 40% of their votes for Trump, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2016. Trump also increased his support in counties with the greatest percentage of workers in service jobs, a group particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. He earned about 47% of votes in those counties, six points more than his share four years ago.\n\nIn one outlier, Trump fared better in the most diverse counties than he did in 2016. Trump was in the lead in about a third of the counties with the most people of color. He won 29% of those counties in 2016.\n\n– Rachel Axon and Dan Keemahill\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins defeats Gideon\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins has been reelected. Democratic challenger Sara Gideon conceded Wednesday afternoon, acknowledging that she lost a hard-fought and closely watched contest to the Republican incumbent.\n\nDemocrats had hoped a win by Gideon would help them gain a majority in the Senate, but the race in Maine was among several disappointments for the Democrats nationwide.\n\nGideon said during a livestream at 1:30 p.m. that she called Collins to concede.\n\n\"I congratulated her on winning this election, and I told her I will always be available to help serve the people of Maine,\" Gideon said. \"Ultimately, that's why I entered this race. And it's why I got involved in public service in the first place.\"\n\n– Steven Porter (Portsmouth Herald)\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race remains uncalled\n\nTrailing by 96,707 votes in unofficial returns out of nearly 5.42 million ballots, Democrat Cal Cunningham on Wednesday afternoon has not conceded the election for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\n“The State Board of Elections is continuing to count ballots, and we plan to allow that process to be carried out, so every voter can have their voice heard,” said Cunningham Campaign Manager Devan Barber.\n\nTillis declared victory in a speech to supporters late Tuesday, and his campaign issued a statement Wednesday afternoon reasserting that he won.\n\n“Tillis’ victory proved pollsters, pundits and the media wrong, as North Carolinians once again chose a problem-solver who keeps his promises and delivers results,” the statement says.\n\nAs of late Tuesday, the North Carolina State Board of Elections said there were around 117,000 absentee ballots remaining that had been sent to voters but not returned. It’s unknown how many of these will be returned and how many were marked for Cunningham or for Tillis. There were also two minor party candidates in the Senate race.\n\nFor these absentee ballots to be counted, voters had to put them in the mail no later than Tuesday, plus had them postmarked Tuesday. The ballots must arrive at county election offices no later than 5 p.m. Nov. 12.\n\nDemocrats need to gain three more seats to take a majority in the Senate, if Biden wins the White House, and four seats if Trump retains it. So the outcome here for either party is crucial.\n\n— Paul Woolverton, Fayetteville Observer\n\nMaine divides votes: 3 for Biden, 1 for Trump\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden was projected to win Maine, but not the state’s competitive 2nd Congressional District where President Donald Trump campaigned repeatedly.\n\nMaine is one of two states, along with Nebraska, that divides its electoral college votes. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District supported Biden, while the rest of the state backed Trump.\n\nMaine’s 2nd District, the largest district east of the Mississippi, covers most of the state geographically outside of the more Democratic areas of Portland and Augusta. Trump won the district in 2016, marking the first time in history that the state split its electoral votes.\n\nTrump campaigned in Bangor and invited a lobsterman to speak at the Republican National Convention. He promoted reopening a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean off New England to lobster fishing, after the area had been closed under the Obama administration while Biden was vice president.\n\nTrump also made a quick stop to visit an orchard in Bangor in late October.\n\nBut Maine as a state has supported Democratic presidential candidates since 1992. Biden enjoyed support for his proposals to strengthen requirements for the federal government to buy products manufactured in America.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump campaign vows to request Wisconsin recount\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign vowed Wednesday to request a recount in Wisconsin, one of the nation’s most closely watched battleground states, before either candidate was projected to win its 10 electoral votes. Biden was holding a slight lead in the state.\n\n“Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be,” said Bill Stepien, Trump’s campaign manager. “The president is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so.”\n\nThough the state was too close to call, Democrat Joe Biden appeared to erase Trump’s lead in early returns and was ahead by a slim margin by Wednesday morning.\n\nA Biden win in Wisconsin, should it happen, would represent a major break in the race toward 270 Electoral College votes in his favor, substantially widening his path to the presidency.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in early returns as Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 outstanding absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Late returns from Green Bay and Kenosha only added to his slender lead.\n\nDemocrats were devastated by the loss there in 2016, marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nA candidate in Wisconsin may request a recount if they trail by no more than 1% of the total votes cast for the office. Who pays for the recount depends on the closeness of the final results.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump attacks vote counting – but GOP blocked changes\n\nAs votes are counted in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, President Donald Trump tweeted criticisms about the time it's taken to count ballots – without noting that Republican legislators contributed to the long counts in those same states.\n\n\"They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!\" Trump tweeted mid-day Wednesday.\n\nBiden has benefitted from counts of absentee and mail-in ballots. Democrats organized mail-in voting campaigns to appeal to people who worried about going to the polls in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nElection officials in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin wanted to start counting these ballots earlier. But GOP-run legislatures in those states blocked changes that, as in other states, would have allowed earlier preparations to count these votes.\n\nTwitter flagged another Trump tweet in which he claimed officials in Pennsylvania were trying to make a 500,000-vote advantage \"disappear.\"\n\nContent in the tweet \"is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process,\" Twitter said in a note attached to Trump's post.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGeorgia expects to finish counting 250,000 votes today in tight race\n\nElection officials in Georgia, which President Donald Trump currently leads Democrat Joe Biden narrowly by around 87,000 votes, expects to finish counting around 250,000 votes by the end of the day Wednesday.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told reporters about 200,000 absentee ballots remain uncounted in the state. He said there are also about 40,000 to 50,000 in-person early votes to be counted.\n\n“Every legal vote in Georgia will count,” he said.\n\nMost of the outstanding ballots appear to be in counties in and around Democrat-heavy Atlanta, which is likely to favor Biden, as well as Savannah. The former vice president has also held a major advantage with absentee voters nationally including in Georgia.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMitch McConnell: GOP needs to do better\n\nAfter Republicans outperformed expectations Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nonetheless said he’s “disturbed” by some GOP deficiencies that need to be addressed.\n\nDemocrats, who outraised many GOP Senate incumbents, do a much better job at harvesting small-dollar donations through the internet, said McConnell – who was outraised in his own, successful, reelection bid.\n\nAnd Republicans need to win back the suburbs and improve their standing with college educated voters and with women, the Kentucky Republican emphasized.\n\n“I’m disturbed by the loss of support in the suburbs,” he said. “We had, overall, I think a better election than most people thought we were going to have, across the country. But, yeah, we have improvement we need to make.”\n\nMcConnell, though, praised President Donald Trump for turning the presidential contest into a cliffhanger when “everybody was writing him off.”\n\n“It was an extraordinary campaign,” he said. “I think it also helped us in our Senate races. With the exception of Maine, the places where we have the best chance of winning are the places where it looks like he won.”\n\nMcConnell said it’s possible enough of the outstanding Senate races could be called Wednesday to determine whether he becomes the minority leader or stays in the majority.\n\n“I’ve been both. Majority’s better,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMitch McConnell: Not unusual that Trump claimed victory\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed concerns Wednesday about President Donald Trump’s false claims that he won the election and the Supreme Court should get involved.\n\n“It’s not unusual for people to claim they won the election,” McConnell told reporters in Kentucky. “But claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.”\n\nMcConnell said he’s not troubled by Trump’s reference to a legal challenge because, in close elections, both sides lawyer up.\n\n“I don't think the president should be criticized for suggesting he may have some lawyers because the other guys are certainly already doing that,” he said.\n\nIn early morning remarks at the White House, Trump cast doubt on the validity of ballots cast by mail because of the pandemic and said he would be going to the Supreme Court because “we want all voting to stop.”\n\nSome Republicans have pushed back on Trump's unfounded claims of fraud and threats of litigation.\n\nMcConnell praised the “beauty of the Electoral College,” saying it’s a useful system during close elections like this one. The Electoral College guarantees that you have finality in each state, he said.\n\n“We ought to be grateful for the Electoral College,” he said, “in a close election like this.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden campaign officials contend he's on track to win Electoral College\n\nCampaign officials for former Vice President Joe Biden argued Wednesday that the former vice president is on a path to accumulate the Electoral College votes in competitive states to win the election against President Donald Trump, but that they would fight for every vote to be counted.\n\n\"Joe Biden is on track to win this election, and he will be the next president of the United States,\" said Biden campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon.\n\n“We expect that at some point later today that the vice president will address the American people,” she told reporters in a conference call. “We’re speaking clearly on the data in the states.”\n\nWhen asked why the race was so close, O’Malley Dillon said: “They’re swing states for a reason.”\n\n“We are going to win Wisconsin, recount or no recount,” she said, citing the prospect that a candidate could request a recount if the margin is within 1%. “We are very confident Wisconsin is ours.”\n\nBob Bauer, an expert in election law who is advising the Biden campaign, said Trump and the Republican Party tried repeatedly to halt voting in the days leading up to the end of voting Tuesday, but were rejected in state and federal courts. Bauer said Trump would also lose if he reached the Supreme Court.\n\n“These specious claims were rejected by court after court,” Bauer said. “He will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats any president has suffered before the highest court in the land.”\n\nTrump's court claims complained about guidance given to election officials, about the use of drop boxes, in-person absentee voting and the length of lines, Bauer said. But he said it’s impossible to imagine the Supreme Court supporting any of the claims.\n\n“It’s impossible to imagine it will have any merit,” Bauer said. “We’re winning the election, we’ve won the election.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP statehouse majorities hold off flips ahead of redistricting\n\nDemocrats who hoped to gain statehouse control in some key battleground states came up short of their goals on Election Day, as redistricting of state and federal voting districts looms in the new year.\n\nOvershadowed by the attention to national politics in the lead-up to the election, Democrats had methodically targeted seat pickup opportunities in several legislative chambers to flip party control in Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nWhile some statehouse seats are still being tallied, Republicans held onto control of many of those places, notably in North Carolina’s state House and Senate. Texas, considered one of the biggest flip opportunities, also stayed red. Republicans likely will hold key voting majorities in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ahead of reapportionment next year.\n\nTallies by the National Conference on State Legislatures, a bipartisan group, said as of Wednesday morning, it appeared to be the fewest party control changes since 1944, when only four chambers changed hands, calling it “remarkably status quo.”\n\nMajority party control in many states will play a crucial role in the once-in-a-decade redrawing of Congressional maps based on the new Census. Redistricting has become an increasingly political process, where critics say both parties seek to chop up the map to favor their party or to dilute the voting power of racial or ethnic minorities.\n\nAbout 6,000 state legislative seats out of the nation’s 7,383 were up for grabs on Tuesday. Republicans have held a majority of state control since the 2010 election, when 13 chambers switched to majority GOP. Going into Tuesday night, Republicans had controlled 59 of 99 state legislative chambers.\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler\n\nBiden campaign: Election 'moving to a conclusion in our favor'\n\nThe Joe Biden campaign is bullish about its chances to reach 270 electoral votes to claim victory in the race for president as the counting of mail-in ballots continues in several battleground states.\n\n“This is moving to a conclusion – and moving to a conclusion in our favor,” a campaign official told USA TODAY on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the official said the Biden campaign is “confident we have won” and expects it to be called later Wednesday morning.\n\nIn Michigan, the Biden campaign believes it has built an “insurmountable” lead, the official said, with the mail-ballots still to be counted expected to favor Biden. The campaign believes the race in Michigan will be called by midday Wednesday.\n\nThe aide said they feel “confident” about Pennsylvania, with votes from hundreds of thousands of mail-ballots in Philadelphia to be released either tonight or tomorrow.\n\nThe campaign expects vote counts in Georgia to conclude by the afternoon Wednesday and for Nevada to be called Thursday.\n\nIf Biden wins Nevada, Wisconsin and Michigan, it would put the former vice president at exactly 270 electoral votes regardless of what happens in Georgia or Pennsylvania.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden takes slight lead in Michigan\n\nIf vote-counting trends hold, Michigan is offering a vivid illustration of the blue wave.\n\nShortly after midnight, President Donald Trump had a big lead with 54% of the vote. Shortly after 9 a.m. EST, Democrat Joe Biden took the lead by 12,000 votes.\n\nAnd there were still hundreds of thousands of ballots to count – most of them absentee, which tend to favor Democrats.\n\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson said final results are likely by Wednesday night.\n\nAt least 5.26 million ballots were cast overall, a record that surpassed the 2008 vote, when Barack Obama won the state. More than 60% of the votes were cast by absentee ballot.\n\nTurnout in heavily Democratic Detroit was expected to be close to 55%, the highest in two decades.\n\nAbout 28,000 voters took advantage of same-day voter registration, which was offered in Michigan for the first time in a presidential election.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nWhat's going on in Pennsylvania?\n\nPennsylvania's 20 electoral votes are poised to play a decisive role in a close presidential race. Trump needs them.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump is leading Democratic challenger Joe Biden 52.4-46.5% in the Keystone State, but that could change as about 1 million mail-in votes are counted.\n\nThose mail-in votes are expected to heavily favor Biden because more Democrats voted by mail, while more Republicans voted in person. Also, the mail-in votes are largely uncounted in counties won by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: Philadelphia, Allegheny, Chester, Bucks, Delaware and Montgomery.\n\n– Candy Woodall (USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania Capitol Bureau)\n\nBiden holds narrow lead in Nevada, results not expected until Thursday\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden held a narrow lead in Nevada as of Wednesday morning as the Nevada Secretary of State said it would not release any more results until Thursday.\n\nThe Secretary of State's office said in a Twitter post they had already counted all in-person early and Election Day votes, and mail ballots sent through Nov. 2. The state still had yet to count all of the mail ballots received on and after Election Day, as well as provisional ballots.\n\nNevada was one of several states that mailed all registered voters a ballot this year, making it difficult to estimate how many ballots were still left to count.\n\nThe state's six electoral votes could be part of either candidate's remaining path to victory with several states still counting ballots. Biden held a roughly 8,000-vote lead with about two-thirds of the vote counted.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nWhere do things stand\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden has secured the key battleground states of Arizona and Wisconsin. Biden also picked up a win in Maine, with three of its four electoral votes (Maine is one of two states that doesn’t award all their electoral college votes to the statewide winner).\n\nPresident Donald Trump secured wins in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas.\n\nBiden won Wisconsin, Minnesota, Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Colorado, the District of Columbia, New Mexico, New York, Virginia, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, Delaware and Connecticut.\n\nThat gives Biden 248 electoral college votes and Trump 213 as of 3:45 p.m. Wednesday. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win the election.\n\nBiden camp slams Trump statement on outcome as 'outrageous'\n\nA top aide to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden slammed President Donald Trump's premature declaration of victory early Wednesday and threatened to defend the counting of legally cast ballots in court.\n\n\"The president’s statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect,\" Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. \"It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens.\"\n\nTrump falsely claimed during remarks at the White House early Wednesday that he had won the presidential contest, even though ballots were still being counting in several states that would actually determine the outcome, and he threatened to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the counting of ballots he described as a \"fraud.\"\n\nTrump:Trump falsely claims he has won election, even though ballots are still being counted\n\nTrump's remarks were consistent with his statements prior to the election in which he sought to cast doubt on the millions of absentee ballots cast this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Those mail ballots always take time to count – sometimes several days. This year, there's simply more of them to count.\n\nPolls taken before the election indicated that Democrats were far more likely to vote by mail and Republicans were more apt to vote in person.\n\n\"We repeat what the Vice President said tonight: Donald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election. Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election,\" O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. \"The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden and Trump express confidence\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden addressed supporters late Tuesday night, saying he felt he was \"on track\" to win the election because of support from mail-in votes, while urging supporters to exercise patience while states count ballots.\n\n\"We feel good about where we are,\" Biden said. \"We really do.\"\n\nMore:Facebook, Twitter label Trump claims over ‘stealing the election’ as potentially misleading\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Trump suggested – falsely – that he had already won, while million of ballots remained outstanding.\n\n“Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump told supporters in the East Room of the White House. “As far as I’m concerned, we have already have won.”\n\nFacebook and Twitter on early Wednesday warned social media users that Trump's claim is potentially misleading.\n\nDems losing chance to flip the Senate\n\nThe chances of Democrats flipping enough seats to take control of the Senate appeared to be dwindling early Wednesday as Republicans fended off challenges in a number of key races.

That comment contrasted with Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, who in a CNN interview became the sixth House Democrat to say Biden's time was up following the president's \"alarming\" debate performance.\n\nFor his part, Biden came out swinging on Monday morning in defense of his spot atop the 2024 Democratic ticket as a pivotal week started where the incumbent's political future remains on the line.\n\nBiden insisted in a letter to congressional Democrats that he's not dropping out despite concerns about his mental fitness and capacity through the 2024 campaign and a possible second term. The oldest president in U.S. history also called into MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' to push back on the growing calls to step aside and later joined a Zoom meeting with his biggest campaign contributors to declare that the party's primary voters have spoken.\n\n\"I've got a pretty good political instinct and here's the deal, it's not going to happen here,\" Biden said during his MSNBC appearance. \"This time around, the American public is not going to move away from me as the average voter.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe Democrats who appeared in the House and Senate for votes Monday evening also expressed concerns about Biden's position atop the ticket, though the number of elected lawmakers who are calling publicly for the president to stand down in November didn't grow by any considerable degree. Looking ahead, Biden is set to huddle with several key constituencies, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A set of important closed-door meetings are also scheduled on both ends of Capitol Hill on Tuesday where Biden's political future is sure to be atop lawmakers' agendas.\n\nDemocrats fret Biden could be paving way for Trump\n\nDemocrats who rallied around Joe Biden four years ago as their best chance to beat Donald Trump now fear he may be paving the way for Trump’s return.\n\nConcerns about Biden’s advanced age, questions about his physical and mental health and the fallout from a disastrous debate with Trump two weeks ago are raising doubts about whether the 81-year-old president can beat Trump again and, even if he does, whether he is capable of serving another four years.\n\n“President Biden has got to prove to the American people – including me – that he's up to the job for another four years,” Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who is facing his own tough re-election battle, told reporters on Monday.\n\nWith lawmakers returning to Capitol Hill after a short recess, the next 48 hours will be crucial for Biden’s reelection bid. Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., told reporters Biden “has to make a decision on how he feels about his ability to run, both for office and to serve as president.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden huddle in the works for Congressional Hispanic Caucus\n\nPresident Joe Biden's outreach to key Democratic constituencies will also include a huddle with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, according to Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.).\n\nPadilla didn't have a set date or time for the meeting. But the California senator who in 2021 replaced Vice President Kamala Harris also told reporters on Monday that he is sticking with Biden in 2024. \"He's more than capable of not just running, but winning in November,\" he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden to meet with Congressional Black Caucus as he pushes back at detractors\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet virtually Monday night with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members have stayed firmly behind the president as some of their Democratic colleagues call for Biden to withdraw from the election.\n\nThe call, confirmed by the Biden campaign, is set for 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nNo Black members of Congress are among the six House Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nWith his campaign in crisis, Biden has leaned into backing from Black voters – whose backing in the 2020 primary was critical for Biden to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nBiden on Sunday visited a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia and emphasized his support from African-American voters during a surprise phone call Monday morning into MSNBC’s Morning Joe.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nParkinson's specialist visited White House eight times in the last year\n\nAn expert on Parkinson’s disease visited the White House a handful of times in an eight-month period − including once with the president's physician − official visitor logs show.\n\nDr. Kevin Cannard, who has served as the “neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit, according to his LinkedIn, made eight appointments stretching from last August to March.\n\nCannard met with Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the president's physician, and two others at the White House residence clinic on Jan. 17, as was first reported by the New York Post.\n\nDuring a contentious press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say why the Parkinson’s expert visited the White House eight times or confirm who the specialist was even visiting. She said “thousands of military personnel” are on the White House campus and that “many of them get care from the White House medical unit.”\n\nJean-Pierre would only confirm that a neurologist checked Biden three times during his annual physical, which is taken at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nBiden’s recent physical report, from February of this year, doesn't mention Parkinson's disease at all despite the president having been evaluated by a neurologist.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Joey Garrison\n\nRep. Adam Smith joins growing chorus of Democrats calling on Biden to end candidacy\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee on Monday called on Joe Biden to end his candidacy after his “alarming” debate performance last month.\n\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is among the most senior Democratic lawmakers to demand that Biden leave the race and allow his party to nominate a new candidate. He is the sixth House Democrat to publicly call for Biden to drop out. Smith urged the president to exit the race as soon as possible to allow the new candidate time to make his or her case to American voters.\n\n“I'm pleading with him – take a step back,'' Smith said in an interview with CNN. \"Look at what's best for the party, look at what's best for the county.\"\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden makes his case to top donors in Zoom call\n\nJoe Biden addressed his biggest donors in a Zoom conference call Monday afternoon, making the case that Democratic voters already spoke during the Democratic primary and that he will be the party’s nominee.\n\nAmid calls for Biden to drop out of the race, the president made it clear to 400 members who joined the Biden Victory Fund National Finance Committee meeting that he is “absolutely and unequivocally” remaining in the race, Chip Forrester, who co-chairs the Biden-Harris Southern Finance Committee, told USA TODAY.\n\nBiden was “clear-eyed and articulate” about his intent to move forward with the campaign, Forrester said, and he called out Donald Trump for being away from the campaign trail since Biden’s heavily criticized debate a week and a half ago.\n\nOn the call, Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley looked ahead to next week’s Republican National Convention, arguing the choice for voters will crystallize during the convention in which Trump officially accepts the GOP nomination.\n\nBiden took questions from some of the donors during the Zoom call and was introduced by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, who has become one of Biden’s top surrogates.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden is \"all in\" for Biden's campaign\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden reassured supporters that she and Joe Biden are intent on staying in the 2024 presidential race during a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Monday.\n\n“Joe has made it clear that he’s all in,\" the first lady said to boisterous cheers from the crowd. \"And just as he has always supported my career, I’m all in too.\"\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nChuck Schumer says he is backing Biden\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, reiterated his support for the president on Monday, telling reporters \"I'm for Joe,\" as he entered the Capitol.\n\nSeveral other congressional Democrats have spoken out to support Biden amid the growing calls for him to drop out of the race, including Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina and Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Alex Padilla of California. Clyburn is a co-chair of Biden's campaign. Padilla sits on its national advisory board.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden calls into Morning Joe\n\nJoe Biden emphatically said he will continue to run for president during a live TV phone interview Monday morning.\n\n\"I want to make sure I was right, that the average voter out there wanted Joe Biden and I'm confident they do,” Biden said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “The bottom line here is that we are not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere. I would not be running if I didn't believe I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”\n\nThe president said average voters would not turn away from him, and expressed frustration with the “elites” calling on him to drop out, claiming they have been wrong in past elections.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee, calling him a “liar.”\n\n“This guy is gonna rip away at a woman's right to choose in a permanent way. This guy is gonna make sure that he exacts revenge. This guy's gonna destroy democracy,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nLatino voters in Arizona say they are unfazed by Biden’s debate performance\n\nBiden campaign organizers in Arizona on Monday sought to rally Latino and young voter support amid swirling concerns about the future of the president’s reelection bid.\n\nLatino voters the USA TODAY Network spoke with in Arizona said they were unfazed by Biden’s poor debate performance and believed demands for him to withdraw from the 2024 race were ridiculous.\n\n“Biden is the best choice. He has the best interest for America as a whole, and I think that performance in itself, at least for me, wasn’t going to change anything,” said 25-year-old Jose Medrano, a Latino voter from Phoenix said.\n\nGarnering support among Latinos, who make up one-quarter of eligible voters in Arizona, is pivotal for Biden this election season.\n\n– Sabine Martin\n\nReps. Jerry Nadler, Adam Smith and Mark Takano call for Biden to exit race\n\nFour House Democrats said Biden should step down as the Democratic presidential nominee during a private phone call for committee ranking members on Sunday afternoon, multiple media reported.\n\nThey include Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York, Adam Smith of Washington, Mark Takano of California and Joe Morelle of New York.\n\nAll of those lawmakers are the top Democrats on House committees. The call was held by House Democratic leadership and was attended by other top Democrats as questions mount over whether Biden can beat former President Trump in November.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJohn Fetterman stands by Biden\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., defended President Joe Biden during an appearance on CNN on Monday as multiple Democrats continue to voice concerns about the incumbent president's decision to stay in the 2024 White House race.\n\n\"Joe Biden has been a great president ... and I'm not going to chuck him for a rough debate,” Fetterman said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania senator, who appeared with Biden at multiple campaign stops across the pivotal swing state on Sunday, said he did not see the president falter.\n\n“He was perfect,\" Fetterman said. \"At every single stop that we had, people were thrilled, I mean, people were thirsty to have their picture taken with the president. And he was crisp, and he was engaged ... he was crushing it.\"\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n‘Run against me’: Biden lashes out at ‘elitist’ Democratic critics\n\nJoe Biden lashed out at Democratic critics during a phone call Monday morning into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” slamming those who want him to withdraw from the race as “elites” and daring them to run against him.\n\n“I’m getting so frustrated by the elites in the party – they know so much more,” Biden sarcastically told co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski\n\n“If any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce they’re (running for) president. Challenge me at the convention.”\n\nDespite facing nominal opposition during the Democratic primary, Biden has argued he is the choice of Democratic voters.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nReps. Seth Moulton, Mike Quigley and more urge Biden to step aside\n\nFive House Democrats have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, including Reps. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, Seth Moulton, D-Mass., Mike Quigley, D-Ill., Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Angie Craig, D-Minn.\n\nQuigley said Monday that he believes there will be more Democrats this week speaking out against President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\n\n“It's going to be an amazing, unfortunately horrible week. But I do think the numbers will grow. I don't know how the president will react to that,” he said during an interview on CNN.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention?\n\nThe 2024 DNC will start on August 19 and run through August 2022 in Chicago. Though, the DNC plans to hold a virtual roll call vote on a date still to be determined to formally decide the nominee.\n\nThe Democratic Party will officially nominate it's presidential and vice presidential candidate during the convention. Joe Biden will be the party's nominee unless he voluntarily steps aside, which he has so far said he will not do.\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWill Biden be replaced?\n\nBarring a very messy intra-party revolt, the Democratic presidential nomination is Biden's to accept – or decline. And so far the president has pushed back on growing calls for his exit with seemingly no intention yet of stepping away.\n\nIf Biden were to change his mind and drop his bid for reelection, focus would then turn to finding a replacement for the top of the ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris, already first in line for the presidency, is a favored candidate for the position.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhere does Biden stand in the polls?\n\nJoe Biden has slipped further behind Donald Trump in most polls taken since the two faced off last month in the first 2024 presidential debate.\n\nAccording to an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey conducted immediately after the debate, Trump edged ahead of Biden 41% to 38%. Prior to the debate debacle, the two contenders were tied at 37% of the vote.\n\nA recent New York Times and Siena College poll found that Trump's lead against Biden increased by 3% after the debate\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer and Karissa Waddick\n\nDavid Axelrod predicts that Biden won’t win, can’t beat Father Time\n\nFormer Obama advisor David Axelrod said Sunday that he thinks it’s more likely Joe Biden will lose the 2024 race “by a landslide” than narrowly beat Donald Trump.\n\n“He’s fought his way back from political defeats and against the odds. And so, his psyche is that he can beat anybody and any long odds. What he can’t beat is Father Time. And that’s really the concern here. It’s not about his record,” Axelrod told CNN.\n\n“There are certain immutable facts of life,” Axelrod added. “And those were painfully obvious on that debate stage, and the President just doesn’t seem to come to − he hasn’t come to grips with it. He’s not winning this race...if you just look at the data and talk to people around the country, political people around the country, it’s more likely that he’ll lose by a landslide than win narrowly this race.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden's letter to congressional Democrats\n\nJoe Biden sent a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday reaffirming his commitment to staying in the presidential race.\n\nBiden said he'd had \"extensive\" conversations with Democrats and understood their \"good faith fears and worries\" about the stakes of the election. \"I'm not blind to them,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\nHe has consistently said since a debate fiasco, where he froze and trailed off at times, that he would continue on in the race.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHistorian with near perfect prediction record rejects calls for Biden to drop out\n\nHistorian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted nine of the last ten presidential elections. Now, he's rejecting the growing chorus of political pundits and Democratic activists calling on Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n“It’s a huge mistake. They're not doctors. They don't know whether Biden is physically capable of carrying out a second term or not,” Lichtman, a professor at American University, said during an interview with CNN. “This is all foolhardy nonsense.”\n\nLichtman references several factors, from incumbency to economic conditions, in forecasting election winners. Debate performance, he argued, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election.\n\n“Debate performances can be overcome,” he said. “At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president.

It just goes on and on and on.”\n\nThe former Democratic president criticized Trump’s platform on issues from immigration to reproductive rights, as well as his character.\n\n“The other day, I heard someone compare Trump to the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day,” Barack Obama said. “Now from a neighbor, that’s exhausting. From a president, it’s just dangerous.”\n\nCalling Trump a “stale” act, former President Obama said the country is “ready” for someone different.\n\n“We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. We’ve seen that movie – and we all know that the sequel is usually worse,” he said. “America’s ready for a new chapter. America’s ready for a better story.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFormer President Barack Obama honors Joe Biden\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said choosing President Joe Biden as his running mate sixteen years ago turned out to be the best decision he made.\n\n“Other than some common Irish blood, Joe and I come from different backgrounds. But we became brothers,” Obama said. “And as we worked together for eight - sometimes pretty tough- years, what I came to admire most about Joe wasn’t just his smarts, his experience. It was his empathy and his decency and his hard-earned resilience; his unshakable belief that everyone in this country deserves a fair shot.”\n\nObama touted Biden’s handling of the economy and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“At a time when the other party had turned into a cult of personality, we needed a leader who was steady, and brought people together, and was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics: putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country,” he said.\n\nHe said that history will remember Biden as an “outstanding president who defended democracy at a moment of great danger.”\n\n“And I am proud to call him my president, but I am even prouder to call him my friend,” he added. “Now the torch has been passed.

In her 2016 convention speech, her comments that “When they go low, we go high” instantly went viral.\n\n— Marina Pitofsky\n\nMichelle Obama: 'Something wonderfully magical is in the air'\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama kicked off her remarks by asking the Democratic crowd in Chicago \"Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it?\"\n\n\"Not just here in this arena… but spreading all across this country we love,\" she said, adding \"It’s the contagious power of hope!\"\n\n— Marina Pitofsky\n\nMichelle Obama criticizes Trump during remarks\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama said that for years, Trump “did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.”\n\n“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said, referring to her and her husband former President Barack Obama.\n\n“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “Black jobs?” she added. “It’s his same old con- his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.”\n\nShe knocked the former president’s policies on healthcare, reproductive healthcare access, educational policies and book banning.\n\n“Going small is never the answer,” she said. “Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty, it’s unhealthy, and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential. So, why would any of us accept this from anyone seeking our highest office? Why would we normalize that type of backward leadership?”\n\nShe said that Americans “deserve so much better.”\n\n“That’s why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people. There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” she said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMichelle Obama cautions against “Goldilocks” voters\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama said Tuesday this year’s election will still be an uphill battle for Democrats, and she offered the party a warning: “We cannot be our own worst enemies.”\n\n“The minute something goes wrong,\" Michelle Obama said, “the minute a lie takes hold, folks, we cannot start wringing our hands.”\n\n“We cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.”\n\nWhile enthusiasm on the left has soared, evidenced by rally attendance and campaign donations, since Harris took over the ticket, some progressive voters have raise their concerns about the vice president’s record.\n\n“Kamala and Tim, they have lived amazing lives, and I am confident they will lead with compassion, inclusion and grace,” Michelle Obama said. “But they are still only human. They are not perfect. And like all of us, they will make mistakes.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nDoug Emhoff makes debut on convention stage Tuesday\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff kicked off his remarks by acknowledging his family members in the audience, especially his mother.\n\n“A special shout out to my mother. I see you. My mother is the only person in the whole world who thinks Kamala is the lucky one for marrying me,” he joked.\n\nEmhoff recalls the time he connected with Harris: he got set up on a blind date and was given none other than Harris’ phone number.\n\n“Now for generations, people have debated when to call the person you're going to set up with. And never in history has anyone suggested 8:30am,” he said. “And yet that's when I dialed. I got Kamala's voicemail, and I just started rambling.”\n\nHe later added, “I was eating at my desk, which was not a regular occurrence for a busy lawyer like me who appreciated a good business lunch, but that's when she called me back and we talked for an hour and we laughed.”\n\nHe said that he loves her laugh, which has been criticized by Trump and other Republicans.\n\n“Maybe that counted as our first date, or maybe it was that Saturday night when I picked her up and told her, buckle up. I'm a really bad driver, because you can't hide anything from Kamala Harris, so you might as well own it, and as I got to know her better, and just fell in love fast,” he said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSen. Duckworth shares personal infertility story in speech\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois highlighted reproductive rights when addressing the convention crowd, speaking to her own experience having children with the help of invitro fertilization.\n\n“If they win, Republicans will not stop at banning abortion,” Duckworth said.\n\nSpeaking to her own journey having children, the senator and veteran blasted Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nDuckworth warned of what she called “Trump’s anti-woman crusade.”\n\n“My struggle with infertility was more painful than any wound I earned on the battlefield,” Duckworth said. “So how dare a convicted felon like Donald Trump treat women seeking health care like they’re the ones breaking the law. How dare JD Vance criticize childless women on cable news, then vote against legislation that would have actually helped Americans to start families.”\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nMcCain’s GOP is ‘gone,’ Arizona Republican says\n\nThe late Sen. John McCain’s Republican Party is “gone” and voters don’t owe a “damn thing” to today’s GOP, said a Republican mayor from the battleground state of Arizona.\n\nMesa Mayor John Giles is leading a coalition of Republicans who support Harris in Arizona. He brought his pitch to Chicago on Tuesday night.\n\n“John McCain’s Republican Party is gone and we don’t owe a damn thing to what’s been left behind,” Giles said.\n\nGiles called McCain his hero during his remarks, and had harsh words for former President Donald Trump. He said that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will put “country over party” in the same spirit as McCain, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate for three decades.\n\nThe Mesa mayor also noted that despite appearing at the Democratic National Convention, he’s a lifelong Republican.\n\n“I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican Party,” Giles said. “The Grand Old Party has been kidnapped by extremists and devolved into a cult.”\n\n-- Stephanie Murray\n\nAlsobrooks, friend of Harris, knocks Trump\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a friend of Harris’s and Democratic nominee for Maryland Senate seat, told convention attendees Tuesday that she’s “always been inspired by women like my grandmother, women who imagined a better future and then have the grit to make it a reality.”\n\n“One of those women is a friend, a mentor and a role model. That woman is Kamala Harris,” she said.\n\nAlsobrooks blasted Trump, saying that ever since he rode down the escalator in 2015 announcing his presidential run, “we as a nation have felt trapped.”\n\n“Every national decision has been made in reaction to this one man and his extremist Maga movement,” she said. “We are still frozen by the fear that Donald Trump might once again come to power. And it's not just our politics that have been trapped. It's our imagination, and then Kamala came along. Kamala has reminded us that we don't need to fear anything, not the future, and certainly not that man.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump only rich in ‘stupidity,’ billionaire Pritzker says\n\nGov.

But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: Stupidity,” said Pritzker, a billionaire whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain.\n\nPritzker was seen as a contender for vice president before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. He praised both candidates and credited Harris for cleaning up Trump’s “mess” during her time in the Biden administration.\n\n“We have a choice, America, between the man who left our country a total mess and the woman who has spent four years cleaning it up. And I think it’s time we stop expecting women to clean up messes without the authority and the title to match the job,” Pritzker said.\n\n-- Stephanie Murray\n\nSanders touts Biden record, says more to be done\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., praised the Biden administration and called for additional reforms in what would be a consecutive Democratic White House if Harris wins 2024.\n\n“Brothers and sisters, bottom-line: We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the billionaire class,” Sanders, 82, said in his convention speech.\n\nThe senator, who ran against both Biden and Harris in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, gave the vice president his backing Tuesday.\n\n“I look forward to working with Kamala and Tim to pass this agenda,” Sanders said.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris and Walz tune in to the DNC live from Wisconsin\n\nAfter the convention delegates finished up their roll call, reaffirming Harris as the party’s nominee, the crowd at the convention turned their attention to a live broadcast of Harris and Walz speaking from a campaign event in Wisconsin.\n\n“We are so honored to be your nominees,” Harris said. “This is a people powered campaign and together, will charge a new way forward.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer calls for a Democratic majority in the Senate, condemns antisemitism\n\nDancing to the tune of Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk” as he entered the convention stage, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer began his remarks offering a stark contrast between a Harris term and a Trump term.\n\n“This November, we can choose a brighter, a fairer, a freer future, or we can relive the dark night of Trump's American carnage. Only one candidate will move America forward, Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\nWorking with Harris in the Senate, Schumer said he saw a leader who was fearless and stood up for middle class families.\n\n“She will lead America forward into a brighter future, but she can't do it alone. She needs a Democratic majority in the Senate of the United States,” Schumer said.\n\nHe also closed his remarks on a personal note, discussing his background as a high ranking Jewish elected official.\n\n“I want my grandkids and all grandkids to never, never face discrimination because of who they are. But Donald Trump, this is a guy who peddles antisemitic stereotypes… I am wearing this blue square to stand up to antisemitism, to stand up to all hate. Our children, our grandchildren, no matter their race, no matter their creed, their gender or family, deserve better than Donald Trump's American carnage,” he said.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhy did Minnesota and California go last at the Democratic convention?\n\nThe ceremonial roll call at the Democratic convention mostly went in alphabetical order by state on Tuesday as delegates cheered for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nBut why did Minnesota and California wrap up the roll call? Those are Harris and Walz's home states, receiving the traditional honor of finalizing the proceedings.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nAna Navarro hits Donald Trump, Kristi Noem\n\n\"The View\" co-host criticized former President Donald Trump on Tuesday and gave Kamala Harris a sweeping endorsement. But she also focused on man's best friend's role in the 2024 election.\n\n\"We cannot elect a president who does not like dogs − or hangs around with people who shoot them,\" Navarro said.\n\nTrump during his term in office said he didn't have time for a furry friend. But South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this year faced major backlash after sharing in her book that she had shot a family dog that exhibited aggressive behavior.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris certified as presidential nominee in party atmosphere\n\nIn an enthusiastic ceremonial vote Tuesday, Democrats approved Vice President Harris as their 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nGoing alphabetically, representatives from each state cast votes in a process that included appearances from politicians as well as stars like Lil Jon, Spike Lee, Eva Longoria, Sean Astin and DJ Cassidy.\"\n\nHarris had already secured the official nomination ahead of the convention via a virtual roll call earlier this month. Democrats held a similarly (but less star-studded) ceremonial vote for Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Monday.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat’s that song that keeps playing in Chicago?\n\nAs Democrats gather in United Center, party organizers have nodded to the home of the Chicago Bulls and star Michael Jordan with use of the basketball team’s iconic theme song, “Sirius.”\n\nThe song played as introduction for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker during Tuesday’s ceremonial roll call as well as for former Bulls player, now NBA head coach Steve Kerr, who addressed the convention Monday.\n\nOther state-related hits made the roll call playlist, including “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Lose Yourself” by Michigan’s Eminem.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump says he would consider appointing RFK, Jr., to administration\n\nTrump has changed his tune considerably on Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., now that the independent candidate is thinking about endorsing him.\n\nAsked by a CNN reporter Tuesday if he would consider a role for RFK, Jr., in a second Trump administration, the former president said: “I didn’t know he was thinking about getting out, but if he is thinking about getting out, certainly I’d be open to it.”\n\nTrump called Kennedy “a brilliant guy\" and \"a very smart guy\" - a far cry from April, when he called him “far more liberal than anyone running as a Democrat.\" At the time, Trump expressed concern that Kennedy's independent candidacy might cost him votes in the general election.\n\nTrump's softer tone came after Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan said that their campaign was considering dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Trump.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump fixer Michael Cohen turns heads at the DNC\n\nMichael Cohen, who worked as a fixer and attorney for former President Donald Trump, was spotted at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.Cohen, who spent more than two years behind bars for lying to U.S. congressional committees about Trump projects, testified against the former president during his May trial in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts related to the hush money payments to a porn star in 2016.DNC attendees stopped to take pictures with the frequent TV personality, who is reportedly shopping his own TV show called “The Fixer.”--Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans bash former president on convention stage\n\nAt the convention Tuesday, anti-Trump Republicans discussed why they were supporting Kamala Harris in November.\n\nKyle Sweetser, a former Trump voter, said that he used to donate the Trump campaign. But changed, he said, when he “started to see Trump's tariff policy in action.”\n\n“Costs for construction workers like me were starting to soar. I realized Trump wasn't for me. He was for lining his own pockets,” said Sweetser. “Now I'm not left wing, period. But I believe our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst. That's why I'm voting for Kamala Harris.”\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former Trump press secretary, said that she wasn’t just a supporter of the former president. She said she was a “true believer” and one of his “closest advisors” who would spend her holidays at the Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“On January 6, I asked Melania if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there's no place for lawlessness or violence,” said Grisham. “She replied with one word, no. I became the first senior staffer to resign that day. I couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCommon: ‘Harris will change the world’\n\nCommon, the award-winning rapper, actor and activist from Chicago, performed on stage with gospel musician Jonathan McReynolds on Tuesday night.\n\n“I thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better,” Common said when he took the stage.

He and my grandmother led their lives with an unwavering faith in God, a respect for human dignity, honesty and a commitment to loving their neighbors as themselves,” Jason Carter said. “Those principles guided them throughout their lives, including during their four years in the White House and the four decades since.”\n\nJimmy Carter has been in hospice care for over a year and former first lady Rosalynn Carter, his wife, died last year.\n\n“Kamala Harris carries my grandfather's legacy.

Raphael Warnock calls Donald Trump a 'plague on the American conscience'\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia on Monday said the 2024 election is \"about the character of the country.\"\n\n\"People with no vision traffic in division,\" Warnock said. \"(Former President Donald Trump) doesn't know how to lead us, so he wants to divide us. Make no mistake, Donald Trump is a plague on the American conscience.

He said he biked down a deserted street, away from an area police had cordoned off. Then an officer approached him, said he was in a restricted area − and promptly slapped him in handcuffs.\n\n– Sophie Carson\n\nWhat time will Michelle Obama speak?\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will address the convention shortly before 10 p.m. CT, according to a DNC schedule.

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who rose to prominence in part over her spars with Georgia's firebrand on the other side of the aisle, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nOn Monday, Crockett turned her attention and ire to Trump: \"Kamala Harris has a resume, Donald Trump has a rap sheet,\" Crockett said, also calling the former president a \"vindictive, vile villain.\"\n\nThe convention kick-off also included some non-Washington stars, like head coach of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors Steve Kerr.\n\nKerr, who just helped lead the USA basketball to gold in the 2024 Paris Olympics this summer, said he now wants to see Americans (presumably even Jayson Tatum) “playing on the same team” and voting for Harris in November.\n\n“And after the results are tallied that night, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, we can tell Donald Trump night night!” Kerr said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump attacks Harris over crime and police policy\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump made crime and police policy his major themes Tuesday, part of his ongoing counter-convention campaign against Democratic opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking at a county sheriff's office in Howell, Mich., Trump decried what he called a \"Kamala crime wave\" – despite surveys showing reductions of crime in recent years – and assailed Harris' law enforcement views.\n\n\"It's a real anti-police crusade,\" Trump said of the vice president who has also been a district attorney in San Francisco and attorney general of California.\n\nOpponents also hit Trump for holding his anti-crime event in Howell, a city with a troubled racial history, including links to the Ku Klux Klan back in the 1960s and 1970s; just last month, groups of white supremacists marched through the city, carrying Nazi flags and chanting \"We love Hitler. We love Trump.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Mich. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said: \"This is, I think, a troubling, troubling strategy that we see from the other side to divide us and to scare us and to stoke fear and anger.\" Trump rejected that complaint after his speech, and reminded reporters that President Joe Biden visited Howell in 2021.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow to live stream Democratic convention\n\nYou can watch USA TODAY's live stream of the Democratic convention below.\n\nObama's legacy looms large in Chicago\n\nOutside the Democratic National Convention, screen, printer and T-shirt vendor and Chicago native Rod Robinson, 60, said Obama represents the hope people like his grandparents long sought. As a Black family, Robinson said they admire Obama’s hard work and success from the very beginning: He never broke their faith.\n\nTuesday, Robinson was selling a special commemorative T-shirt featuring Obama and Harold Washington, Chicago's first Black mayor. Obama was a community organizer in Chicago before becoming a law professor at the University of Chicago and entering politics.“He’s as advertised: He’s not someone you can go dig up social media dirt in. He’s a good father, a good husband, a good man. And he came through for a lot of people,” Robinson said. “To see somebody … who followed all the rules, followed all of the instructions, went to school, went to college and came out in top? He’s like a superhero. He just doesn’t have a cape or invisible jet.”\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll of Black voters in several swing states shows Obama remains wildly popular among Black Democrats, especially: In Michigan, 84% of Black voters had a favorable impression of Obama, compared to 72% for Harris, 64% for Biden and 15% for Trump. In Pennsylvania 82% of Black voters have a favorable opinion of him, compared to 68% for Harris, 58% for Biden and 15% for Trump.\n\nThe survey of 500 Black voters in each of those states was conducted earlier this month. Harris is trying to persuade those Obama supporters to turn out for her in November, battling dissatisfaction felt for Biden by Black Americans, a key voting bloc to a Democratic win.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nWill Taylor Swift endorse Kamala Harris? Swifties in London weigh in\n\nWhile the DNC is in full swing in Chicago, Swifties in London spent most of Tuesday afternoon debating whether the singer would announce the rerelease of her album “Reputation.” So while many fans were dressed in outfits featuring the album’s black color scheme and snake motif, other garb had political implications.\n\nHalli Baker of Ohio walked down Olympic Lane to Wembley Stadium wearing a “Taylor for President 2024” white T-shirt.\n\n“The shirt is not leaning red. It’s not leaning blue,” Baker said. “I do think she’ll come out and be supportive of the Democratic Party.”\n\nMeghan Connors of Joplin, Missouri, agreed, saying Swift has already passively endorsed Harris.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if she doesn’t publicly endorse her by the end of September or maybe mid-October,” Connors, 30, said. “I think she’ll promote it on social media, but don’t think she’s going to the DNC. American politics can get so volatile or so aggressive, you look at the Capitol attack. She wouldn’t put herself in that much of the public eye because it would be dangerous.”\n\nRochelle Ulloa from Los Angeles thinks Swift has planned out when she will make a political move.\n\n“It's like all eyes are on Taylor to make a move, but she's always made a good, honest effort,” Ulloa said. “Like she supported President Biden in the last campaign, and I think she just waits for when the time is right.”\n\n— Bryan West\n\n'He’s just, like, an old guy':Gen Z Democrats laugh at Donald Trump-Taylor Swift AI drama\n\nWhen does the Democratic National Convention start tonight?\n\nConvention organizers are “making adjustments” to Tuesday night’s programming to ensure the festivities don’t stretch into the early hours of the morning, as they did on Monday.\n\nDay 2 of the Democratic convention will start at 5:30 p.m. CT/6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSpeakers will include former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, Illinois Gov.

Sanders on Israel-Hamas war and U.S. aid: While he has been a staunch supporter of what Biden and Harris have done on domestic issues, on this issue, “I think the president is wrong,” he said. “Israel had a right to defend itself against this horrible Hamas terrorist attack, but it did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,” Sanders said. “And now creating a situation where tens and tens of thousands of children face starvation because Israel is not letting humanitarian aid come through.”\n\nWhile he has been a staunch supporter of what Biden and Harris have done on domestic issues, on this issue, “I think the president is wrong,” he said. “Israel had a right to defend itself against this horrible Hamas terrorist attack, but it did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people,” Sanders said. “And now creating a situation where tens and tens of thousands of children face starvation because Israel is not letting humanitarian aid come through.” Sanders on progressive members of the Democratic primaries losing: Reps. Jamaal Bowman, D-New York, and Cori Bush, D-Missouri, all members of the informal group of House lawmakers known as the \"Squad,\" were booted by more moderate Democrats. Asked if the progressive wing of the party was weakening, Sanders pointed to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, who defeated a primary challenger. “We have a campaign finance system today which is corrupt,” he said, blaming the defeats of Bush and Bowman on super PACs. ”And that is not, to me, what democracy is about.”\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHarris commences transition planning\n\nKamala Harris has begun preliminary planning for a potential presidential transition, a move expected of any presidential candidate, according to a source familiar with the planning efforts.\n\nThe transition team will be led by Yohannes Abraham, U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Abraham served as executive director of the Biden-Harris transition in 2020 and worked in various roles in the Obama administration. The law firm Covington & Burling, which conducted Harris’ VP vetting and counts former Attorney General Eric Holder among its partners, will advise how best to set up the transition team.\n\nDonald Trump announced his official transition team on Friday.

Olivia Troye, a former Trump White House national security official and Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary in the Trump White House, will also address the crowd.\n\n“True conservatism has been replaced with a cult. I’ll be making that clear,” Kinzinger said of his speech in a post on X.

But there was never a chance that the new Democratic nominee would accept such an early contest, especially one on Fox.\n\nHarris and aides said Trump needed to stick with his commitment for a Sept. 10 debate, an agreement he made with President Joe Biden before he withdrew from the race.\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns are also negotiating a second debate in October.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nWhat Barack and Michelle Obama will say tonight at the Democratic National Convention\n\nTonight is one of the most anticipated nights of the 2024 Democratic convention when Barack and Michelle Obama take the stage in their political backyard.\n\nTwo decades ago, Obama, a barely 40-something Illinois Senate candidate, launched himself into America's history books with a speech that's still talked about.\n\n\"It's good to be home in Chicago,\" Obama said in a post Monday evening on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe 44th president said he looks forward to joining party faithful to \"share what's at stake in this election,\" and why Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Walz, her running mate, should be elected.\n\n\"President Obama believes this is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and is committed to doing all he can to elect Vice President Harris and Democrats across the country,\" Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama said in a statement.\n\n\"His strategy this fall will be driven by where he can move the needle with Democrats and persuadable voters, especially in states with key races.

Trump Jr. vowed that the GOP will fight, with their voices and their vote this fall.\n\nTrump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, also compared Trump’s reaction after getting shot in the right ear during the assassination attempt on America’s spirit: “When he stood up with blood on his face, and the flag on his back, the world saw a spirit that could never be broken,” Trump Jr. said. “And that is the true spirit of America.”\n\nAt the beginning of his speech, Trump Jr. honored firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, addresses RNC\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump’s 17-year-old granddaughter, told convention attendees that she sees a side of her grandfather that most people don’t see.\n\n“He calls me during the middle of the school day to ask how my golf game is going and tells me all about his… even when he's going through all these court cases, he always asks me how I'm doing. He always encourages me to push myself to be the most successful person I can be. Obviously, he sets the bar pretty high but who knows, maybe one day I'll catch him.”\n\nShe said she was “shocked” when she heard the former president had been injured in a shooting on Saturday at his Pennsylvania rally.\n\n“I just wanted to know if he was okay,” she said. “It was heartbreaking that someone would do that to another person.

Doug Burgum joked to convention attendees, he was standing on one leg for two hours after suffering an Achilles injury.\n\nNow, he’s on stage rooting for Trump and an issue he's long focused on: energy dominance.\n\n“Who will make America energy dominant?

We intervened in other countries' affairs and signed treaties that only benefited other nations. We spent too many years ignoring America's priorities.”\n\nHe then argued that there was only one man “with the strength to call out the lies and failures of both Democrats and Republicans:\" Donald Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump doesn't care if you're gay or straight, black, brown or white, or what gender you are. He knows that we are all Americans and that it's time to put America first,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRNC vibe check: Somber but confident in a Trump victory\n\nDonald Trump's conventioneers are experiencing a mix of emotions this week: Reverent, somewhat subdued over Saturday's assassination attempt, and supremely confident that victory is at hand.\n\nIt's complicated when your candidate is nearly killed.\n\nFrom the food trucks along Wisconsin Avenue to the convention hall at Fiserv Forum, Trump Republicans marvel at Trump's survival of an assassination attempt, along with the political struggles of Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile concerned about Trump's health - his bandaged ear has become an icon, and some delegates have patched their own ears in solidarity - most Republicans are also giddy at the prospect that Trump may come out of this week's convention in the battleground state of Wisconsin as a stronger presidential candidate.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nRonny Jackson kicks off speakers with criticism for Kamala Harris\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, led the round of speakers Wednesday by criticizing President Joe Biden and, most pointedly, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“She has not been truthful with us,” Jackson said, referring to Biden’s decision to remain in the presidential race. “She has lied to us. She has put party above country and she is as unfit in character as Joe Biden is in body and mind.”\n\nShould Biden change his mind and exit the race, Harris is the top candidate to take his spot running against Trump.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe Republican National Convention is four days total, running from Monday through Thursday.\n\nTrump is expected to speak on the final night, while his running mate, JD Vance, headlines Wednesday.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Usha Vance?\n\nUsha Vance, the wife of J.

JD Vance of Ohio. In late May, Harris accepted an invitation by CBS News to debate on either July 23 or Aug. 13. She accepted a third potential date – Aug. 12 – on Wednesday. The Trump-Vance campaign has yet to commit to any vice-presidential debate.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested Wednesday its hands are tied because it doesn’t know who will be on the Democratic ticket.\n\n“We don’t know who the Democratic nominee for vice president is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention,” said Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBabydog on stage, with 2024 ‘prediction’\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice appeared at the convention Tuesday, with a special guest – his four-year-old English bulldog, Babydog.\n\nThe chubby pup, famous in his home state, had her own chair on stage next to Justice, who touted Trump and Republicans' chances in 2024.\n\n“Babydog’s got a prediction for everybody here, and here’s the prediction: Babydog says we’ll retain the House, the majority in the House.

Trump and JD Vance in November.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nAnti-Trump group releases new ad knocking JD Vance\n\nThe anti-Trump Lincoln Project dropped an ad Wednesday highlighting Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s past criticism of the former president.\n\nThe roughly 90-second spot, geofenced around the Republican National Committee in Milwaukee, features Donald Trump reading lyrics to “The Snake.” Trump has referred to the song during campaign events to illustrate his position on immigration.\n\nPeppered throughout the ad are Vance’s comments about Trump during the 2016 election cycle, including interviews where he called Trump “noxious” and referred to himself as a “never Trump guy.”\n\nVance is now one of Trump’s closest allies and has said the former president proved him wrong.\n\n-Haley BeMiller\n\nFirst campaign ad from official Trump, Vance ticket\n\nThe Trump campaign has its first major advertisement since Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s became the official GOP vice presidential nominee.\n\nThe two-and-half minute video released Wednesday does not feature an appearance from Vance but concludes with both candidates’ names on screen.\n\nIn it, Trump promises to “totally obliterate the deep state” and criticized the multiple criminal investigations he's facing.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump’s Republican National Convention fuses faith and politics\n\nTrump has emerged as an unlikely spiritual figurehead as a political leader, experts told USA TODAY, fusing faith and politics at a level never seen before.\n\nArizona State University religious studies professor Terry Shoemaker said feelings of fear in the wake of the Pennsylvania shooting, relief at Trump’s recovery and excitement for his reelection chances is a perfect storm for \"a more profound kind of civil religious experience\" in Milwaukee this week.\n\nThere was a wide array of religious symbolism on the floor of the Fiserv Forum the first night of the convention, where a panoply of screens beamed images of the American flag and Christian cross onto an eager crowd between speeches.\n\nSudiksha Kochi, Melissa Brown, BrieAnna Frank and Chris Ullery\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention?\n\nThe DNC will be held from August 19 and run through August 22.

The former VP also launched his own bid for president last year.\n\nThis week, Trump chose Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. as his 2024 running mate. Vance is expected to speak at the RNC Wednesday night.\n\nPence posted on X on Wednesday afternoon that he stopped at three nonprofits in the Fort Wayne area.\n\n\"Truly Inspiring Day in Fort Wayne Indiana with friends making a difference for vulnerable families and kids,\" Pence said in the post. \"Grateful for the work at Pearl Street Arts, Bridge of Grace Ministries and Boys & Girls Club of Fort Wayne! God Bless You All!\"\n\n– Brittany Carloni\n\nWho is Amber Rose?\n\nDemocratic strategist and CNN commentator Van Jones called it the \"most effective\" speech of Day 1 at the RNC, and the \"most dangerous\" for Democrats.\n\nConservative U.S. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna from Florida posted \"Beauty and brains\" after the speech was over.\n\nThey weren't talking about a politician. They were talking about Amber Rose, 40-year-old model, influencer, entrepreneur and former reality TV star, perhaps the most surprising speaker during the first day — or any day — of the convention in Milwaukee.\n\n– Chesnie Wardell\n\nAmber Rose was a surprising RNC speaker:What did she say? How effective was it?\n\nEric Trump says he was watching his father's rally with his children during assassination attempt\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, told CBS on Wednesday that he never thought he would be sitting on a couch with his two children watching his father “almost get assassinated on live TV.” Trump’s right was injured during the shooting, and he’s wearing a bandage over it during the Republican convention.\n\n“It’s severe. You know, this isn’t - this isn’t fun. He always said it was the greatest earache he’s ever had,” Eric Trump said. “And it was far too close. I would say it should have never have happened. You know, he was millimeters away from having his life expunged. ... I’m sure the ear doesn’t feel well.”\n\nHe added that his father has no stitches but “certainly a nice flesh wound.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Ronny Jackson?\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, is slated to speak Wednesday at the Republican National Convention.\n\nJackson served as White House Physician under the Obama and Trump administrations.

Jackson said he helped set up his nephew to attend the rally on Saturday. He said his nephew’s injury “was not serious and he is doing well.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nKamala Harris agrees to third possible VP debate date\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has now accepted three potential dates for a vice-presidential debate hosted by CBS News, according to a Biden-Harris campaign official.\n\nIn late May, Harris accepted an invitation by the network for a debate on either July 23 or Aug. 13. On Wednesday, she also accepted Aug. 12 as a potential date.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, named Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate on Monday. Vance has yet to accept the proposed CBS debate.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWill J.D. Vance’s religious background sway Catholic voters?\n\nReligion experts told USA TODAY it is unlikely Vance’s religious background will sway Catholic voters as he seeks to shore up support for the Republican ticket.\n\n“People are already pretty committed to their positions. And JD Vance being Catholic or not Catholic is really, I don't think going to change anything,” said Cristina Traina, the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair of Catholic Theology at Fordham University.\n\nVance’s selection as Trump’s running mate was unsurprising to Chris Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university in Vance’s home state of Ohio. But it’s because of Vance’s loyalty to Trump, not his religion, that Devine believed he was added to the ticket.\n\nDevine co-authored the 2020 book, “Do Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections” alongside Kyle Kopko. The duo’s research suggested Catholic vice presidential nominees did not move the needle among Catholic voters in past elections.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi and BrieAnna Frank\n\nTrump pollster says New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota in play\n\nTrump campaign pollster John McLaughlin said during an interview on CNN Wednesday that he believes the possibility of traditionally blue states like New Jersey, Minnesota and Virginia voting for Trump is “very real” this election.\n\nIn Virginia, for instance, McLaughlin pointed to internal polling showing Trump performing well with African American voters and military service members.\n\n“We leading in the battleground states. We're leading in the national polls. We never saw that in 2016,” McLaughlin said.\n\nA recent Cook Political Report aggregate of national polls found Trump leading Joe Biden 47% to 45%.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance speech to highlight is childhood, upbringing\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance will recount his journey from poverty to the vice presidential nomination during his primetime speech at the Republican National Convention tonight.\n\nVance is expected to share how he grew up with a mother addicted to drugs and no constant father figure in his life, according to a source familiar with his prepared remarks. That story is outlined in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” which thrust Vance into the national spotlight during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nVance will share how his upbringing informed his views on key campaign issues, including trade, immigration and the fentanyl crisis, the source said.\n\nIn announcing his running mate, Donald Trump said the senator will help his campaign reach Rust Belt voters, particularly in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\n— Haley BeMiller\n\nWho is speaking tonight at the RNC?

JD Vance has vaulted into the role of heir-apparent of the MAGA movement and become instant White House contender for 2028.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said the nomination means there’s “a very high chance” Vance could become president in 2028 if he and Trump win in November.\n\n“(Vance is) the one guy in that movement that’s a current politician that’s out there that actually, really speaks sort of to the ‘America First’ people,” he said at an event hosted by Axios Tuesday. “It isn’t like we’ll be right back to the establishment. … That’s where our base is. That’s where the Republican Party is.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nIn a redefined GOP, populism and a new coalition\n\nIt's his party.\n\nDonald Trump's takeover of the GOP has been on full display at the Republican National Convention — an even more complete transformation than at the two previous conventions that nominated him and propelled him to four years in the White House.\n\nWith a big win in 2016 and a volatile loss in 2020, Trump has managed to replace Ronald Reagan as the party's touchstone, excised the Bush dynasty that had been a political power and launched two presidencies, and pummeled the ranks of moderate Republicans into flight or silence.\n\nRead more on Trump's takeover of the Republican Party.\n\n— Susan Page\n\nWho is Lara Trump? RNC co-chair delivers Day 2 finale\n\nLara Trump is co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. She delivered the final speech of Day 2 at the RNC on Tuesday, describing Trump as “exactly what this country needs right now.”\n\nShe became co-chair of the RNC in March after serving as an adviser to Trump’s 2020 campaign. Lara Trump is married to Trump’s third son, Eric.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nHaley, DeSantis promote GOP unity\n\nAt one time Republicans Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley were doing all they could to warn primary voters that Donald Trump couldn't win the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBut millions of ballots and an attempted assassination has changed all that.\n\nThe two affirmed Trump's perch on the party's mountaintop and further solidified this week's presentation that conservatives are closing ranks as Democrats remain divided over President Joe Biden's nomination.\n\n\"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity,\" Haley told delegates. \"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nDon't miss our key RNC Day 2 takeaways.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nKamala Harris calls JD Vance a ‘rubber stamp’ for Trump’s agenda\n\nVice President Kamala Harris slammed former President Donald Trump’s new running mate, JD Vance, describing him as a “rubber stamp” for Trump’s “extreme agenda,” in a video published on Wednesday.\n\n“Make no mistake: JD Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country,” Harris said in her 45-second-long, direct-to-camera address. She criticized Vance for supporting Trump’s efforts to undermine the 2020 election, national abortion restrictions and voting against IVF protections in the Senate.\n\nHarris and Vance spoke over the phone on Tuesday. The pair are widely anticipated to face off against one another in a debate later this year, but have yet to agree on a host or a date.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhy Republicans see a chance to flip the rhetorical script on Biden\n\nAfter Saturday's shooting at a Donald Trump rally, Republicans have accused Democrats and President Joe Biden of trafficking in dangerous rhetoric.\n\nTired of Democrats calling them autocrats, dismissing their policies as a threat to democracy and being blamed for violent political rhetoric, Republicans see a chance to flip the script on Biden and his main campaign message.\n\n— Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat happened on Day 2 of the Republican National Convention\n\nWhile the second day of the RNC focused on immigration and border security, the other theme was unity.\n\nNikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary and received a mixed response when she entered the stage, threw her support to the former president. Haley previously was not scheduled to speak at the convention and often criticized Trump on the campaign trail.\n\n“Donald Trump has my strong endorsement. Period,” she said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also spoke Tuesday night where they advocated for a Trump presidency.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nMake America Strong Once Again: What does Wednesday’s RNC theme mean?\n\nDay 3 of the Republican National Convention is “Make America Strong Once Again,” and will focus on foreign policy, border security and the United States standing on the world stage.\n\nUSA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network have around 60 journalists on the ground in Milwaukee and you can follow along with our live blog for updates throughout the day.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nWho is Trump's VP pick JD Vance?\n\nJD Vance, 39, is a first-term senator from Ohio, who skyrocketed to fame after publishing his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nVance was first elected to the Senate in 2022 with no prior political experience, but he had widespread name recognition in light of his bestselling book. “Hillbilly Elegy,” later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance’s journey from a childhood riddled with abuse to a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile Vance was previously critical of Trump, at one point comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be “America’s Hitler,” he changed his tune ahead of his 2022 Senate race. Since then, Vance has become a loyal ally to Trump. He is also close with one of Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n— Haley BeMiller and Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/election-2020-latest-delaware-no-winner-declared/6158286002/", "title": "Election 2020: Biden delivers remarks in Wilmington, wins Michigan ...", "text": "It is Nov. 4 and, as many expected, the world still doesn't know who the next president of the United States will be.\n\nHere are the latest updates on the 2020 election.\n\nPresidential results | Local results | Tuesday's updates\n\n4:15 p.m. Biden delivers remarks at the Chase Center\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden stepped onto a podium inside the Chase Center and issued another confident message Wednesday just after 4 p.m.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"It's clear,\" Biden said, \"that we're winning enough states to win.\"\n\nThe Delawarean, joined by running mate Kamala Harris, did not declare victory, however.\n\n\"I'm not here to declare that we won, but when the count is finished we believe we'll be the winners,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's six-minute speech sounded at times like a victory speech.\n\n\"Yesterday proved that democracy is the heartbeat of this nation,\" he said.\n\n\"Here, the people rule. Power can't be taken or asserted.\"\n\nAs his opponent's campaign has spent most of the day declaring fraud and much of the campaign casting Biden and Democrats as enemies, Biden offered his normal message of unity.\n\n\"To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies,\" he said. \"We're not enemies.\n\n\"We are campaigning as Democrats, but I will govern as an American president.\"\n\nShortly after he got off stage, Michigan was called for Biden by CNN, moving him to 253 electoral votes. He is ahead in two states, Arizona and Nevada, that would deliver him to the White House.\n\n\"Every vote must be counted,\" Biden said. \"No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now. Not ever.\"\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n3:35 p.m. All eyes on Philadelphia\n\nPresident Trump said recently that \"bad things happen in Philadelphia.\"\n\nWell, things are certainly happening in Philadelphia. The president's campaign is sending lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, to the city to monitor the ongoing counting of the city's ballots.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Pennsylvania \"turned away pleas from county elections officials across the state\" to agree on allowing counties to start counting mail-in ballots early, Spotlight PA reported.\n\nTrump showed an early lead in the crucial battleground state Tuesday night, but the gap has tightened – Biden's deficit is less than 300,000 votes – and there are still thousands, potentially more than one million, votes to be counted.\n\nThe president's son, Eric, tweeted at 3:28 that the Trump campaign won Pennsylvania. Campaigns do not call election results and many votes remain uncounted.\n\nAll of this drama in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania may be meaningless as far as determining who wins the election.\n\nIf Biden holds on in Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, he would reach 270 electoral votes and clinch the presidency while votes in Pennsylvania continue to be tabulated.\n\nMichigan is expected to be decided in the next few hours, and Biden has a narrow lead. Arizona, which the AP has called for Biden, is expecting another update tonight at 9 p.m. EST and Nevada, where Biden holds a slim lead, expect to have an update Thursday morning.\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n3:15 p.m. What would recounts look like?\n\nThe Trump campaign has already indicated it will request a recount in Wisconsin given the less-than-one-percent margin in Joe Biden's victory in the state.\n\nBut Wisconsin isn't the only state that could see votes counted a second time.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania could still be contested.\n\nFULL STORY: What are the recount rules? We break them down in key states\n\n— Jeff Neiburg\n\n2:16 p.m. Biden wins Wisconsin\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden has won the state of Wisconsin, a key “blue wall” state that had crushed Hillary Rodham Clinton’s hopes in 2016.\n\nBiden’s win in Wisconsin, which came a day after polls closed and as absentee ballots from the Democrat-heavy city of Milwaukee poured in, represented a major shift in the tight race toward 270 Electoral College votes between Biden and President Donald Trump, widening the former vice president's already growing path to the White House.\n\nBiden overtook Trump Wednesday when Milwaukee reported its roughly 170,000 outstanding absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Late returns from Green Bay and Kenosha only added to his slender lead. The state, with 10 Electoral College votes, had long been considered a top-tier battleground with the potential to give huge momentum to Biden or Trump.\n\nIf Biden also captures Michigan, it should allow him to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House even if he loses Pennsylvania, where votes were still being counted in a close contest.\n\nIn a closing crescendo of campaign travel, Trump made five trips to Wisconsin in the final month of the race amid surging coronavirus cases. His last stop, in Kenosha, came the day before the election.\n\nBiden made his only October visit to the state on the Friday before the election. He outspent Trump heavily in the home stretch on TV in Milwaukee and Green Bay, the most important media markets.\n\nTurnout in the state topped 3.2 million — the most votes ever cast in a Wisconsin election. At least 71% of the state's voting-age adults cast ballots — the highest turnout rate ever after the 2004 election.\n\nIn the end, the result was much tighter than polling had predicted. For much of Wednesday morning, Biden led by a mere 20,000 votes, close to Trump’s winning margin in 2016. Polling conducted before the election had regularly shown Biden with a near double digit lead in the state.\n\nIt was the fourth time in six presidential elections that Wisconsin was decided by less than a percentage point, and the sixth time in eight presidential races that the winner failed to reach 50%.\n\nWisconsin was not only at the epicenter of the presidential race. It was also at the center of the two national crises that shaped the campaign's final months: the pandemic, and the clash over policing and protest. Its coronavirus caseload rose faster than any other top battleground.\n\nDemocrats were devastated by the loss there in 2016, marking the first time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump mercilessly mocked Clinton for not campaigning frequently enough there, suggesting she had taken it for granted at her peril.\n\n— Craig Gilbert (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) and John Fritze (USA TODAY)\n\n2:10 p.m. Trump campaign files lawsuit to 'halt counting' in Michigan\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign said Wednesday it filed a lawsuit in a Michigan state court to \"halt counting\" ballots in the state until the Republicans could gain access to the tallying process.\n\nThe lawsuit, which the campaign did not immediately make available for review, appears to be one of the first filed in the wake of tight contests in several battleground states.\n\n\"We have filed suit today in the Michigan Court of Claims to halt counting until meaningful access has been granted,\" Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. \"We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.\"\n\nThe prospects of the lawsuit are not known.\n\n— John Fritze and David Jackson of USA TODAY\n\n1:45 p.m. Biden eclipses Obama's record for most votes for presidential candidate\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, former Vice President Joe Biden has received more than 70 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record for the most votes received by a presidential candidate.\n\nIn 2008, Obama received 69,498,516 votes. AP has credited Biden with 70,203,832 as of 1:45 p.m. Wednesday. Trump trails in the popular vote by about 3 million votes.\n\nThere are still several thousand votes yet to be counted in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n1 p.m. Where is the race in each state mid-day?\n\nThe race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is still too close and too early to call, but several key states could have results Tuesday evening that give onlookers some clarity. Here's a breakdown by state.\n\nArizona: The Associated Press and Fox News have projected Arizona for Biden. He leads by about 100,000 votes with 84% of the vote reported.

If the race stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can force a recount. If the margin is larger than that, there's no chance for one.\n\n\"Wisconsin has been a razor-thin race as we always knew that it would be,\" Stepien said.\n\nIn the statement, he referred to public polling as a \"voter suppression tactic,\" and raised unfounded doubts about the \"validity of the results.\"\n\nMeagan Wolfe, the director of the state Elections Commission, told NBC News on Wednesday that all ballots have been counted, though the results have not yet been made final.

Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead. Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\n— Brandon Holveck, Craig Gilbert (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\n\n11:30 a.m. The latest in Wisconsin\n\nBiden holds a razor-thin lead of around 20,000 votes over Trump in Wisconsin with the majority of unofficial returns in.\n\nHowever, the presidential race in Wisconsin has not yet been called.\n\nTrump earlier led in the Midwestern battleground state but Biden made up ground through the night as mail-in ballots substantially broke for the Democratic challenger.\n\nBen Winkler, chairman of Wisconsin's Democratic Party, tweeted that \"when all votes are counted, we're confident Joe Biden will win Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe state's 10 electoral college votes will not, on their own, be enough to push Biden to hit the 270 electoral college ceiling needed to win the presidency.\n\nBefore the mail-in ballots started to be counted in Wisconsin, Trump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes. Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016.\n\n— Kim Hjelmgaard and Craig Gilbert of USA TODAY\n\n11:15 a.m. Pennsylvania has 1.3 million mail ballots to count\n\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday morning roughly 1.3 million mail ballots still need to be counted.\n\nBoockvar said the election \"could not have gone more smoothly,\" but emphasized it will take a long time to count \"every single vote.\"\n\nPennsylvania received about 2.6 million mail ballots. Mail ballots across the country have overwhelming favored Biden, while in-person ballots have strongly favored Trump.\n\nEarlier Wednesday morning, Philadelphia officials said the city has more than 200,000 mail ballots to count. Both campaigns on Wednesday said they are confident they will win Pennsylvania.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n10:30 a.m. Campaign 'confident' Joe Biden will win 2020 election\n\nBiden’s campaign manager said Wednesday morning that the campaign is \"confident\" Biden will win the 2020 election, believing the Democrat will claim victory in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada.\n\n\"Joe Biden is on track to win this election, and he will be the next president of the United States,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, campaign manager, said during a briefing. \"We believe we are on a clear path to victory by this afternoon.\"\n\nBiden is expected to address the American public at some point Wednesday.\n\nIn the race to 270 electoral votes, the campaign laid out what they believe is Biden’s path to the White House. While thousands of votes are still being counted, the Democrat is now leading Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan — though the races have yet to be called.\n\nO'Malley Dillon said the campaign believes the races in Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia (considered a toss-up at this point) will be called Wednesday, while the results for Nevada and Pennsylvania will come tomorrow.\n\nNorth Carolina, the Biden campaign believes, is leaning for Trump and the results will come in a few days.\n\nIn the early hours of Nov. 4, President Donald Trump falsely declared an election win in the White House’s East Room, despite millions of votes still needing to be counted. He said he is \"winning\" in a number of states, despite races still not being finalized and thousands of votes still not counted.\n\nHe also noted that he plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop counting votes, though it’s unclear how he would do that.\n\nBiden senior adviser Bob Bauer said during the briefing that if Trump and his lawyer went to the Supreme Court then \"He will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats a president has ever suffered.\"\n\nAs of this morning, Biden was leading Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, though votes were still being counted.\n\nAfter the Biden campaign announced a briefing at 10 a.m., the Trump campaign announced advisers for the president would hold a briefing at 9:55 a.m. The president’s campaign manager Bill Stepien said Trump is in a \"very good position,” despite returns showing Biden taking a lead in states like Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n— Meredith Newman\n\n9:50 a.m. Philadelphia officials provide update on ballot counting\n\nPhiladelphia election officials said Wednesday morning they've counted 141,000 ballots as of 4 a.m. and will share additional updates as soon as possible.\n\nThey asked for patience from the city, estimating Philadelphia will end up with between 350,000 and 400,000 mail-in ballots.\n\n\"It is more important we do it right than we meet an artificial deadline,\" Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt said.\n\n\"Days and nights are beginning to blend together for all of us,\" he said earlier Wednesday on CNN. \"If everything keeps up, we’ll have the total results in the next couple of days.\"\n\nSchmidt told reporters the votes that came in after 8 p.m. Tuesday are at the end of the counting process. Votes in Pennsylvania received by Friday will be accepted if they were postmarked before the polls closed.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n9:15 a.m. The latest in Michigan: Biden overtakes Trump\n\nWith roughly 90% of the vote in, Trump led Biden by roughly 13,000 votes early Wednesday morning, but there were still hundreds of thousands of ballots that needed to be counted before Michigan knows its final election results.\n\nBiden overtook Trump around 9 a.m., leading by about 10,000 votes with 94% of the vote in.\n\nMost of the votes being counted Wednesday are absentee ballots, and are expected to help Biden over Trump.\n\nThese numbers can change at any minute, as tallies continue to come in.\n\nThe delayed results were expected and is a sign clerks are deliberate in their counting process, said Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\n\"Michigan update: Election officials worked through the night to #CountEveryVote. That work continues,\" Benson tweeted at approximately 7 a.m.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of ballots in our largest jurisdictions are still being counted, including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Flint, Warren & Sterling Heights. Every vote will count.\"\n\nBenson expects to have most of the ballots counted at some point today.\n\n— Dave Boucher, Detroit Free Press\n\n8:40 a.m. The latest in Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is waking up Wednesday without a winner, as its 20 electoral votes are poised to play a decisive role in a close presidential race.\n\nTrump is leading Biden 55%-43% in the Keystone State, but that could change after more than 1.4 million outstanding mail-in votes are counted.\n\nThose mail-in votes are expected to heavily favor Biden because more Democrats voted by mail, while more Republicans voted in person. Also, the mail-in votes are largely uncounted in counties won by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: Philadelphia, Allegheny, Chester, Bucks, Delaware and Montgomery.\n\n— Candy Woodall (USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania Capitol Bureau)\n\nWhere does the presidential race stand?\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Tuesday, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has 238 electoral college votes and President Donald Trump has 213 electoral college votes. To win the election, 270 electoral college votes are needed.\n\nThe most key win of the night was Biden's victory in Arizona, which had not picked a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996. Biden also won three of Maine's four electoral college votes and Nebraska's second congressional district worth one electoral college vote (Maine and Nebraska don't award all of their votes to the statewide winner).\n\nTrump maintained control of Texas, Florida, Ohio and Iowa — states Democrats hoped would swing in their favor in a dream \"blowout\" scenario.\n\nBut several battleground states remain too close to call, largely due to record-setting numbers of mail and absentee ballots.\n\nResults in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are not expected until Wednesday morning at the earliest. In each state, Republican-controlled legislatures blocked legislation that would allow mail votes to be processed ahead of Election Day.\n\nAll three states swung to Trump in 2016, but polls had favored Biden entering Election Day.\n\nThe southern states of North Carolina and Georgia are too close to call, which, if either swing to Biden, would be gains from years past.\n\nTrump holds a slight lead in Georgia, with 94% of the vote reported, however several highly-populated areas in and around Atlanta that historically favor Democrats have not reported full results.\n\nThe result in North Carolina, where Trump also leads, may not be known for several days. Mail-in absentee ballots, which have widely favored Democrats, will be accepted there until 5 p.m. on Nov. 12 if they were postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\nThere is also still uncertainty in Nevada. With about two-thirds of the vote counted, Biden holds a roughly 8,000-vote lead. The Nevada Secretary of State said on Wednesday morning that the state will not release any more results until Thursday.\n\nDid the candidates speak last night?\n\nYes. Around 12:30 a.m. Biden made a brief speech from the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington to a parking lot of honking cars.\n\nHe said he believes he's on track to win, expecting victory in Pennsylvania and \"feeling good\" about Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nAddressing supporters around 2:20 a.m. in the White House's East Room, Trump falsely declared he won the election and made other false statements about the state of the race. He said he is \"winning\" in a number of states, despite races still not being finalized and thousands of votes still not counted.\n\nFROM WILMINGTON: Biden declares 'We’re on track to win' with key states unknown\n\nWhat happened in Delaware?\n\nGov. John Carney, Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester all handily defeated their Republican challengers to remain in office.\n\nIn the state legislature, history was made when Sarah McBride won the District 1 state senator seat. McBride, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, is the first transgender state senator in the nation.\n\nDemocrats picked up two seats in the legislature — the Republican Party will no longer hold any Senate seats in New Castle County.\n\nDemocrats Kyle Evans Gay and Spiros Mantzavinos narrowly defeated Sen. Cathy Cloutier (R-Heatherbrooke) and Sen. Anthony Delcollo (R-Elsmere), respectively.\n\nSen. David Lawson (R-Marydel), meanwhile, held onto his seat, beating Democratic challenger Jaci Hugg.

Gore ruling in 2000, the application argues, \"'The counting of votes that are of questionable legality ... threatens irreparable harm,' not only to (the Republican Party of Pennsylvania), its voters, and its supported candidates, but to all Pennsylvanians and even the 'country by casting a cloud upon ... the legitimacy of the election.'''\n\nThe legal battle over the deadline extension is the only 2020 voting issue now facing potential Supreme Court action. It turned the case away just over a week ago because the justices would have been unable to hear arguments and rule before Election Day.\n\n-- Kevin McCoy, USA Today\n\nState: Majority of the mail ballots in Pa. have been counted\n\nThree days after the election, the majority of the mail ballots have been counted in the commonwealth, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\nNow the counting of the provisional ballots is underway, a news release states.\n\nVoters could cast a provisional ballot if they were approved for a mail ballot but never received it. Other reasons can include the voters name wasn't in the poll book or the voter's returned mail ballot was rejected but they believe they are eligible to vote.\n\nEach county election board must individually adjudicate each provisional ballot and determine whether it can be counted, the news release states. For example, election officials will be checking to see if the voter returned a mail ballot. If the mail ballot is confirmed, that is the one that counts.\n\nCounty boards of election must complete the process within seven days of the election.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Democratic candidate Joe Biden had a slight lead over Republican President Donald Trump. Biden has 3,314,835 votes to Trump's 3,300,535.\n\nAlmost 96 percent of mail ballots have been counted, according to the state's election website.\n\nThe state also plans to conduct a statewide risk-limiting audit, just as it did for the June 2 primary to confirm the outcome. The purpose of the audit is \"to strengthen election security and integrity, confirm the accuracy of election outcomes, and provide confidence to voters that their votes were counted accurately,\" the release states.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\n1,700 mail-in ballots found at Pa. post offices\n\nAs if there wasn’t enough going on with the presidential election in Pennsylvania, multiple outlets are reporting that the U.S. Postal Service found more than 1,700 mail-in ballots at postal facilities in the state.\n\nAccording to ABC News, a Postal Service court filing overnight acknowledged the found ballots, which the network reported were mainly from Democratic areas.\n\nReuters reported that 1,076 ballots came from Philadelphia and about 300 were from Pittsburgh, while another 266 came from the Lehigh Valley.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania over President Donald Trump by about 6,800 votes Friday morning as mail-in ballots continue to be counted.\n\nThe vast majority of mail-in ballots have favored Biden as Democrats overwhelmingly took advantage of the option during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Republicans chose to vote in-person on Tuesday.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday, Reuters reported, ordered the Postal Service to sweep its facilities twice a day in states with extended mail-in ballots deadlines, such as Pennsylvania, where those ballots can be received until 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nThose sweeps were part of a lawsuit brought by the NAACP to try and stop changes implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy that the group said would hurt mail delivery and disenfranchise Black voters, ABC News reported.\n\nDuring a court hearing on Thursday, lawyers said that the Postal Service had delivered nearly 150,000 ballots just on Wednesday, according to Reuters.\n\n-- J.D. Prose\n\nPa. ballots arriving during 3-day extension not expected to 'make or break' election\n\nMail ballots that arrive in election offices up to three days after the election are not expected to \"make or break\" the results of the election, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Thursday.\n\nSome smaller counties reported receiving zero ballots, and some larger ones have received about 500 the day after Election Day. That's not many, Boockvar said.\n\nUnder the three-day extension, which is being challenged in court, mail ballots with the Nov. 3 postmarked can arrive in local election offices until 5 p.m. Friday. President Donald Trump's campaign has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. Those ballots are being segregated.\n\n\"Unless it's super close, I don't see them making or breaking this one way or another,\" Boockvar said during an interview on CNN.\n\nBoockvar also said the majority of votes in Pennsylvania are expected to be counted today. In the past, she had indicated she expected the majority of the counting to be finished by Friday.\n\n\"It's looking like we're ahead of schedule,\" she said.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\nPa. counties to watch as the counting of mail ballots continue\n\nPennsylvania joins the rest of the country at the polls, though many residents have already submitted their ballots, whether voting early in-person or via absentee ballot. Get Pa. election results updates as they roll in and check back for updates.\n\nMore than a million ballots remain to be counted in Pennsylvania the morning after the Nov. 3 election, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State website.\n\nNearly 1.4 million — more than half of the mail-in and absentee ballots cast — have yet to be counted, the state's dashboard shows.\n\nResults from the in-person voting at the polls is still coming in as well. About 85 percent of the precincts statewide have reported results.\n\nHere are counties to watch today:\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nOnly 21 percent of the mail ballots have been counted at this time. More than 276,000 remain to be counted.\n\nBucks\n\nLess than 30 percent of the mail ballots have been counted. More than 109,000 still have to be tabulated.\n\nAllegheny\n\nNearly half of this county's mail ballots have been counted. More than 175,000 are waiting to be counted.\n\nMontgomery\n\nSlightly more than half of the ballots have been counted. More than 115,000 remain to be tabulated.\n\nWaiting until Wednesday to count\n\nSome counties decided to wait until today to start counting the mail ballots. That includes Cumberland, Franklin, Beaver and Greene counties.\n\nTheir results are showing zero counted.\n\nState and York County officials are working to address why the mail-in ballot count is not showing up on the state's website, county spokesman Mark Walters said. The county has counted everything received through yesterday.\n\nIt includes more than 77,000 mail ballots cast.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\nHere's why it's taking so long for Pa. results\n\nThe count continues in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that analysts predicted would decide the election.\n\nAs the electoral map fills in with shades of blue and red, their projections appear to be true.\n\nAll eyes are on Pennsylvania as Election Night tallies continue into the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nMore than 3 million votes have been counted in Pennsylvania, and more than 7 million are expected to be counted by the time the results are final. That means about 4 million votes are outstanding in the state.\n\nSlowing the count down this year is a high volume of mail-in ballots this year. More than 3 million mail-in ballots were requested in Pennsylvania during the general election, and they will take some time to count.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nAP survey: COVID played important role for Pa. voters\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is the most pressing issue for Pennsylvania voters, according to an Associated Press survey of more than 4,000 Pennsylvania voters.\n\nAP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 127,000 voters and nonvoters — including 4,120 voters and non-voters in Pennsylvania — explored how the electorate felt about candidates and the state of the nation as voters headed to the polls.\n\nThe survey polled an equal mix of Republican and Democrat voters, and focused primarily on suburban and small town/rural voters.\n\n-- Daveen Kurutz\n\nInjunction sought to prevent election officials from allowing people to 'cure' ballots\n\nU.S. Rep.

And just before the polls closed, a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats reportedly was shot with a paintball by a moving vehicle, but she did not have more information on it.\n\nThe state received a few reports of voter intimidation, Boockvar said, and they were resolved with calls to the county.\n\nBoockvar and Gov.

Airy neighborhood of Northwest Philadelphia, voting ended where it began: with Black women heading to the polls.\n\nA voter who only wished to be identified by her first name, Mitra, exited a polling location at a local library at 7:56 p.m., the last to cast her ballot just minutes before the polls closed. She woke up early Tuesday intending to vote in the morning, but after seeing long lines on the news, slid it to the tail end of her to-do list. Her vote was straight Democratic, and she particularly keyed on vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a source of inspiration.\n\n\"The possibility that a woman can be vice president in America is huge,\" said Mitra, 56. \"It represents mother, auntie, sister. It would give balance to what has been our norm as a country.\"\n\nOn the library's steps several feet away, Philadelphia Councilman Derek Green was also wrapping up his day. He said turnout at the polling location was about 67% mid-day, which put it within potential striking distance of the turnout for Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nAfter the morning snafus that saw some long lines and confusion among voters over which polling site to use, Green said Philadelphia's voting process was mostly smooth.\n\n\"I've gotten around the city to see what's going on, as well as touching base with other people,\" Green said. \"It's been a very strong turnout.\"\n\n-- Kyle Bagenstose\n\nAP VoteCast survey: Pennsylvania voters split on Biden, Trump\n\nPennsylvania voters are divided on Vice President Joe Biden, but slightly lean towards an unfavorable opinion of President Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press survey of nearly 4,000 Pennsylvania voters.\n\nAP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 127,000 voters and nonvoters — including 3,970 voters and 806 nonvoters in Pennsylvania — explored how the electorate felt about candidates and the state of the nation as voters headed to the polls.\n\nWhile voters are more slightly more favorable towards Biden than Trump, they're more unfavorable towards Sen.

Head to your polling place NOW\n\nBucks County is urging voters who were informed they had problems with their mail-in ballots to immediately go to their polling places before polls close tonight at 8 p.m. to case their votes by provisional ballot.\n\nCounty spokesman Larry King said the county and some political campaigns had notified roughly 1,600 voters that their mail-in or absentee ballots have obvious defects.\n\nMistakes that would have triggered the notification included failure to properly complete the outer declaration on the return envelope. The declaration required voters to date, sign, and print their name and address. Anyone of those things missing could have disqualified their ballot from counting, King said.\n\nThose voters were contacted by postcard and other means saying they had until Monday, Nov. 9, to correct that ballot.\n\nHowever, the state on Tuesday disagreed. Those voters who have yet to correct their ballots should head to their polling place, where they'll be allowed to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nSome ballots already had been corrected, with long lines reported at board of elections offices as voters sought to correct their ballots.\n\n\"We don't know how many of the 1,600 have already done that,\" King said.\n\n-- Marion Callahan\n\nHow to look up election-related court actions in Pa.\n\nThe Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts has created a landing page for election lawsuits that are filed across the state.\n\nThe state court system will also be posting updates on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSo far, the page contains a few cases, including a Commonwealth Court opinion upholding a Philadelphia judge’s ruling throwing out a lawsuit from President Donald Trump’s campaign that sought to allow poll watchers into the city’s satellite election offices, where people can register, request a mail-in ballot and vote at the same place.\n\nClick here to visit the page.\n\n-- Dylan Segelbaum\n\n4-hour-long line in York County\n\nVoters in East Manchester Township, York County, waited up to four hours Tuesday at a polling place plagued with long lines all day.\n\nAs the sun was setting, people at the front of the line said they had been there since 1:45 p.m.\n\nThe line outside Northeastern Middle School stretched around the building late in the day, and York County Commissioner Julie Wheeler left her post at the Board of Elections to visit the site.\n\nEugene DePasquale, Democratic candidate for the 10th Congressional District, visited the school in the dinner hour and brought pizzas for people standing in line.\n\n\"There is nothing like this across the whole region.

It’s a process known as pre-canvassing and can include inspecting ballots for missing information.\n\nLawyers for Barnette argued Montgomery County voters were essentially given an unfair advantage over other counties that were not contacting voters about similar problems.\n\nThe order isn’t an official ruling on whether those votes will be counted.\n\nBallots changed before, during or after polls opened Tuesday morning will have to be kept separate from all other ballots pending a hearing tomorrow morning at 9.\n\nIt is unclear at this time precisely how many votes will be left out of the county’s initial election results.\n\n-- Chris Ullery\n\nScranton polling machine problem minor, fixed quickly\n\nSome Scranton residents suffered a longer-than-expected wait to cast their votes due to issues with ballot scanning machines on Tuesday.\n\nSocial media posts and reports from officials noted at least two incidents that delayed voters due to problems with ballot scanning machines.\n\nA video shared on the “Real news for the people” Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon showed what appears to be a poll official addressing a crowd, informing them that due to unspecified problems with machines, voters would have to utilize other options to engage in Pennsylvania’s general election.\n\n“I’m to just wait around and wait for these machines to be fixed, so that’s what’s possibly going on right now,” the unidentified individual who filmed the video says at the start of the clip.\n\nIn the video, the election official calls out \"9-1\" and \"9-2,\" apparently referencing Scranton polling districts 9-1 and 9-2. The building, later identified as the Scranton Cultural Center, was designated as the new polling location for those districts by the Lackawanna County Board of Elections during an Oct. 29 meeting.\n\nThe original polling location for districts 9-1 and 9-2 was the United House Apartments, a senior living high rise which was damaged by an Oct. 25 fire that killed at least one resident and displaced over 100 others.\n\nWithin the video, the apparent official informs that crowd that they can either wait for the machines to be fixed, leave and return to vote later, or fill out their ballot and place it in an emergency slot, where it could be scanned once the machines were operational.\n\nThe crowd, including the person filming the video, expressed frustration with the delay. Numerous people interjected the official’s speech, provoking the man to shout “May I have your attention” in an attempt to control the unruliness.\n\nThe social media post containing the video, entitled “BREAKING: Elections workers are now claiming voter machines are down in Scranton, Pennsylvania” was credited to one Mike Coudrey.\n\nA Lackawanna County Department of Elections staff worker later stated that the problem was “very minor,” and that it was “resolved quickly.” The worker acknowledged that the Department had received calls regarding social media posts referencing the incident, but noted that the problem was only “temporary.”\n\nFurther issues caused more significant delays at the Kennedy Elementary School, which hosted districts 20-2 and 20-3.\n\nAccording to Kathy Bufford, judge of electors at Kennedy Elementary School on the south side of Scranton, the issue stemmed from the polling location’s two ballot scanning machines having been programmed for the opposite district.\n\nBufford said that the problem took an hour and half to figure out, and a technician from the board of elections eventually fixed the machines. However, one of the machines jammed on a paper ballot, resulting in further delays.\n\nBufford said the site was not fully operational until 9:30 a.m., two-and-a-half hours after it was meant to open.\n\nBufford noted that voters were offered options to wait for the machines to be fixed, or to place their ballots in an emergency slot where they would be held until Bufford had time to count them. Most choose to wait.\n\nSome voters accused Bufford of causing the problem to tamper with the vote, though she denied this.\n\n\"People were getting hyper and yelling at me. They were really mad,\" Bufford said. \"But there's nothing I can do. We're not trained on these machines.\"\n\nIn the early evening, Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti tweeted that precincts 20-2 and 20-3 would remain open until 8:45 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\n-- Brian Myszkowski\n\nErie ballot-tossing rumor debunked\n\nErie County Board of Elections Chair Carl J.

Sullivan’s directive requires that an update certifying that those steps have been taken be filed no later than 4:30 p.m.\n\nThe order came in a lawsuit that the NAACP filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Postal Service and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who the civil rights organization alleges made changes that have caused “unreliable service and widespread delays.”\n\nThe on-time delivery rate for first-class mail in the Philadelphia area and central Pennsylvania had fallen to 61.5% and 65.6%, respectively, by Oct. 28, court documents state.\n\nBut later, other plaintiffs who sued the Postal Service requested an immediate status conference, alleging that the agency’s certification did not comply with the court’s order.\n\n-- Dylan Segelbaum\n\nMore:Central PA, Philadelphia area see dramatically slower mail service in late October\n\nWe interrupt this election to bring you news of a Pa. pandemic milestone\n\nPennsylvania saw its highest daily increase in COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, the Department of Health confirmed at noon on Tuesday.\n\nThe department announced that as of Election Day’s midday update, the commonwealth had seen 2,875 additional positive cases of coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 214,871 cases in total.\n\nIn addition, 32 deaths attributed to COVID-19 brought the running total up to 8,855 fatalities.\n\n-- Brian Myszkowski\n\nEarly morning voting snags strike the Philadelphia area\n\nWith much of the country's political focus on Pennsylvania, voting in the Philadelphia area was beset Tuesday morning by long lines, polling location confusion and reported conflicts between partisan poll watchers and election officials.\n\nEarly morning reports of hour-long waits in voting lines stretching around city blocks came in from several locations in the city and its close-in suburbs. When polls opened at 7 a.m., South Philadelphia Republican Jack Burris witnessed a line that stretched more than a block and a half from the polling site at the Marconi Older Adults Center.\n\nHe decided not to wait. When he returned at 11 a.m. he found a gauntlet of political signs outside the site, but no line.\n\nUpper Darby resident Joe Corrigan said while lines were similarly long in the HIghland Park School polling location, he did not see any voters give up and leave out of frustration.\n\n\"Lines were about an hour-plus,\" said Corrigan.\n\n-- Karl Baker and Kyle Bagenstose\n\nPa. secretary of state: No major voting problems\n\nThe Pennsylvania office overseeing elections had not received reports of voter intimidation or improper electioneering at polls, though Trump election officials reported on social media poll watchers were being kept far from counting tables in Philadelphia.\n\n“This is the first time I’m hearing about it,” Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said at a press conference Tuesday morning. She planned to follow up on the allegations with Philadelphia officials .\n\nTrump Director of Election Day Operations Mike Roman made claims on his Twitter account Tuesday alleging that Democratic election officials in Philadelphia were keeping “our poll watchers so far from counting tables there’s no way to actually observe.”\n\nRoman also tweeted a complaint that sample Democratic ballots were being given out to individuals in line to vote in Philadelphia calling it “illegal campaigning inside of a polling location.”\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Jonathan Marks said that he was aware of complaints about political signs closer than allowed to the entrance where voting takes place and a poll watcher who was allegedly prevented from entering a Philadelphia voting site.\n\nAlmost four hours after polls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday, Boockvar and Marks reported few complaints at other polling places in the state.\n\nThe biggest complaint involved late openings, which Marks called a “fairly typical” complaint. There were also reports in Luzerne County in the northeastern part of the state of slow starts at polling stations because of “technical issues” or confusion among poll workers.\n\n-- Jo Ciavaglia\n\nFederal lawsuit alleges Montgomery County illegally precanvassed ballots\n\nPresident Donald Trump pledged during the closing days of his campaign for a second term that Republican lawyers would be watching Pennsylvania voting and potentially filing lawsuits about any violations.\n\nBefore noontime on Election Day, a GOP challenge in the state’s Eastern District federal court seemingly made good on his promise.\n\nMore:Congressional candidate sues Pa. county over early pre-canvassing of mail-in ballots\n\nThe Montgomery County Board of Elections, near Philadelphia, illegally pre-canvassed mail-in ballots received before Nov. 3 and in some instances gave voters whose ballots had errors an opportunity to re-vote before Election Day voting started, alleged the lawsuit filed on behalf of Kathy Barnette, a Republican congressional candidate.\n\nPennsylvania’s election code “expressly prohibits” counties from pre-canvassing any ballots before 7 a.m. on Election Day, the lawsuit said.\n\n“Montgomery County is pre-canvasing mail-in and absentee ballots, before 7 a.m. on Election Day, detecting defects in these ballots, and contacting some mail-in or absentee voters to change their ballots,” the lawsuit said, alleging that the procedure violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause. “To make matters worse, the Montgomery County Board of Elections is restricting the ability of candidates and their representatives, the parties and their representatives and other legally constituted watchers to observe the entire canvass process for the mail-in and absentee ballots.”\n\nThe legal challenge focuses on a Pennsylvania County that Trump lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton by a 59% to 37% margin in 2016, results from that race show.\n\n“We believe our process is sound and permissible under the election code,” said Kelly Cofrancisco, a spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Board of Elections.\n\nThe court is expected to hold a hearing on the lawsuit later Tuesday, said Cofrancisco.\n\n“This is another attempt to cast out perfectly valid votes,” said Suzanne Almeida, the interim director of the Pennsylvania branch of Common Cause, a government watchdog organization and democracy advocate.\n\n-- Kevin McCoy\n\nVoter told to turn Trump hat inside out at polls\n\nSomerset County voter Bob Glotfelty has been voting for a long time.

He put the mask back in his pocket but refused to remove the hat and was allowed to finish the voting process.\n\n“My daughter had a Trump t-shirt and has never said anything to her,” he said.\n\nGlotfelty said that he has several Trump hats and likely wore one in the primary as well.\n\nSomerset County Elections Director Tina Pritts said it is the county policy to not allow those items inside the polling places. However she said that she instructed poll workers to let it go as long as the person is not actively campaigning. She said she was not made aware of the situation in Berlin and the policy is not in writing.\n\n“I am going to contact the polling place,” she said.\n\nAccording to the VotesPA website, “Voters may wear campaign gear, but election officials and poll watchers cannot wear campaign materials at a polling site.”\n\nGOP officials were mulling whether to pursue legal action over the county policy.\n\nSomerset County GOP Chairman Guy Berkebile said that a county policy that does not allow voters to wear candidate material inside of the polling places is a violation of First Amendment rights.\n\n-- Michelle Ganassi\n\nPoll opens 2 hours late in Luzerne County\n\nThe Citizens Voice in Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, which Trump won in 2016, reported one polling place opened two hours late because workers had trouble access the voter database used to check in voters.\n\nOne voter was quoted as saying many people left without voting.\n\nThe paper reported that Kathy Bozinski, chairwoman of the Luzerne County Democratic Party, addressed poll problems with a message on Facebook: \"We've been deluged with issues at the polls this morning. Please know that every one was immediately reported to Luzerne County and they tell us they are dealing with them. Please stay and vote, it is essential! Lines at most polls are long, but moving smoothly.\"\n\n-- Scott Fisher\n\nPolling place confusion in Philadelphia\n\nVoters of a predominantly Black precinct in Northwest Philadelphia expressed confusion and frustration this morning after learning they were at the wrong polling location.\n\nShaina Fields, a 34-year-old resident of the Mt. Airy neighborhood, said she received a voter information card from the Pennsylvania Department of State in the mail sometime in September. It told her to vote at her normal location, the Mt. Airy Recreation Center.\n\nBut upon arrival just after the polls opened at 7 a.m., a poll worker explained that Fields in fact needed to vote at a nearby library. Although the location was just across the street, Fields became the last in a long line of at least 60 voters standing outside the library in 40-degree weather. Fields is Black, as were the vast majority of those standing in the slow-moving line.\n\nShe had hoped to get in early and get out fast.\n\n\"It's horrible,\" Field said. \"When I walked up (and saw the line) I was like, 'Oh my god.'\"\n\nIt was a similar experience for Aaron Cichowski, a 29-year-old white commercial printer who waited in line for half an hour and got all the way to the sign-in table at the recreation center before being told he was in the wrong location. He explained voting materials also instructed him to vote at the poll.\n\nCichowski, like others, said they had specifically decided to vote in person to avoid any potential confusion with mail-in ballots.\n\n\"I know it's really important to be here at the ballot box,\" Cichowki said.\n\nGilbert Fuller, Jr., a 63-year-old Black man, had a different experience. He arrived at the recreation center at 4 a.m., curious to watch how the day would begin. He said a sign at the closed door instructed voters of his precinct -- Ward 22, Division 17-- to vote at an elementary school a mile away. He and another woman made the trip, only to learn they were in fact to vote at the recreation center. He then hitched a ride back with a poll worker.\n\nWhen he returned, the sign was no longer there and the polls were preparing to open. Nearly four hours after his journey began, he was able to pull the lever and vote.\n\n\"Not trying to sound conspiratorial, but it's definitely strange that that would be there,\" Fuller said of the sign.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of State, Philadelphia Mayor's Office, and Philadelphia City Commissioners did not respond to immediate requests for comment.\n\n-- Kyle Bagenstose\n\nPolling place problems in Erie\n\nErie County Democratic Party Chairman Jim Wertz said there were a multitude of problems across the county when polls opened at 7 a.m., from poll workers not having pens for voters to fill out their ballots to instances of three to five poll workers failing to show up at some precincts alone.\n\nIn one case, an elections judge is said to have quit on the spot, Wertz said.\n\nAt the John F. Kennedy Center in the city of Erie, poll workers were unsure about how to start the new voting equipment, which led to about a 20-minute delay in opening the polling place, Wertz said. Voters standing in line shouted obscenities as they waited. Similar situations unfolded at other polling places in the city of Erie, he said.\n\nWertz also said he received reports out of a precinct in McKean Township in which a poll watcher allegedly went from inside the polling place to outside, where they handed out GOP literature, which is something poll watchers are strictly prohibited from doing.\n\nAnd at another precinct someone was asking voters for their ID, which is only required for new voters or those voting for the first time at a new precinct, he said.\n\n\"Things are starting to level off,\" Wertz said at 9 a.m. \"We're still getting a few calls.\"\n\nDespite the problems, Wertz did not know of any voter who had left their polling place without voting.\n\n-- Matthew Rink\n\nTwitter flags Trump tweet about Pa. ballots\n\nTwitter Inc. flagged a tweet by President Donald Trump Monday night that that said a Supreme Court order allowing Pa. to count absentee votes received up to three days after Nov. 3 would “induce violence.”\n\nTwitter added this disclaimer to the tweet: “Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.”\n\nAppearing on MSNBC, Former Republican Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Biden supporter, said, \"It's not the first time that President Trump has rejected a decision of our judicial system. From time to time, it's just another reminder that not only does he not understand the rule of law or our Constitution, but he doesn't understand separation of powers.\"\n\n-- Scott Fisher\n\nWolf pushes back against Trump 'watching you' comment\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump delivered an ominous warning in his closing argument to Pennsylvania voters.\n\n\"We're all watching you, governor,\" the president said of Gov. Tom Wolf. \"We have a lot of friends with eyes on you.\"\n\nTrump during a campaign stop Monday afternoon at Wilkes-Barre Scranton Airport in Luzerne County repeated the falsehood that Wolf still has the state shut down and again accused Pennsylvania of cheating in the election.\n\nAs of early Tuesday morning, only one case of election fraud had been detected in Pennsylvania: a Republican man in Luzerne County tried to fill out a ballot for his dead mother.\n\n\"Governor, please don’t cheat, because we’re all watching,\" Trump said. \"We’re all watching you, governor. We have a lot of eyes on the governor.\"\n\nWolf hours later responded to the president in a tweet: \"Pennsylvanians will not be intimidated. You can watch us count every vote and have a fair election.\"\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nMore:Purple haze Pa.: Why the Keystone State is always a presidential battleground\n\nElection issues in western PA: Postal worker arrested; ballots missing\n\nIn the midst of a volatile presidential race, a slew of issues related to the election have boiled over in the Pittsburgh area, including a few criminal cases.\n\nThe first among them was the arrest of two postal workers in October, both charged with delaying or destroying mail.\n\nA report to the Postal Service claimed that Sean Troesch, 48, had nine bags of trash outside his home, awaiting garbage pickup. All of them contained bundled mail, some political, one requesting a mail-in election ballot, but no completed mail-in ballots were found, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nThe other mail carrier, James McLenigan, 29, was allegedly seen throwing mail into trash bins. The mail that was collected also contained a request for a mail-in ballot, but no completed ballots were found.\n\n'Elections no, Revolution yes': Two political candidates in the region experienced vandalism Sunday, one at home and the other at his office.\n\nThe phrase \"Elections no, Revolution yes\" was spray-painted on the office of U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat in Allegheny County, and the same was done to the home of Sean Parnell, a Republican candidate in Butler County, running for the state's 17th congressional district, according to TribLive.\n\nBallot issues: A Butler County official told KDKA in Pittsburg that possibly thousands of mailed ballots have gone missing.\n\nAs of Oct. 29, only 22,000 of 40,000 mail-in ballots had been returned to the elections office there, the lowest rate in the state. And in Allegheny County, the Republican Committee challenged more than 200 absentee and mail-in ballots, claiming possible voter ineligibility, according to KDKA.\n\n-- Kim Strong\n\nMore:Election Day 2020: Voters head to the polls in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump suggests aggressive legal strategy in Pa.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his reelection campaign are signaling they will pursue an aggressive legal strategy to try to prevent Pennsylvania from counting mailed ballots that are received in the three days after the election.\n\nThe matter could find its way to the Supreme Court, especially if those ballots could tip the outcome in the battleground state.\n\nThe three-day extension was ordered by Pennsylvania's top court. The Supreme Court refused to block it, but several conservative justices have indicated they could revisit the issue after the election.\n\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, already has told local elections officials to keep the late-arriving ballots separate, but also to count them. She acknowledged that a post-election court fight could change that.\n\n-- Mark Sherman, AP\n\nSecure drop boxes will be locked at 8 p.m. on Election Day\n\nDon't wait until the last minute to drop off your absentee or mail-in ballot because the secure drop boxes will be locked at 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nIt doesn't matter if a long line forms on election night. Ballots must be received by the county by 8 p.m., and counties will lock the drop boxes at that time, said Jonathan M. Marks, deputy secretary for elections and commissions.\n\nThat's why voters shouldn't wait until Election Day to drop off their ballots, Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\nMore:Trump men vs. Biden women: Which voting group in Pa. will pick the next president?\n\nPa. Secretary of State contacts FBI about election security\n\nSecretary of State Kathy Boockvar answered questions about Cumberland County officials receiving a request last week from President Donald Trump's campaign asking for information about ballot security.\n\n\"The email, obtained by The (Carlisle) Sentinel, went so far as to ask for the address and room numbers of ballot storage locations, and requested that the information be sent to the Gmail account of a Florida-based Trump operative,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nBoockvar said counties should never provide any election security information to any third party. It was discussed during a call with the counties last week.\n\n\"...I understand that Cumberland County did not provide the requested information, which is the right move,\" she said.\n\n-- Teresa Bockel\n\nKnow your rights before you hit the polls\n\nEligible Pennsylvanians have a constitutional right to \"cast their ballot safely and free from intimidation,\" according to a news release from Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar on Saturday.\n\n“Voters should educate themselves on their rights before they go to the polls on election day,\" Boockvar said. Go here for a quick rundown of voter rights in Pa.\n\n- Ted Czech\n\nSome counties will not count mail ballots until after Nov. 3\n\nSeveral Pennsylvania counties will not be counting absentee and mail-in ballots on election night and will wait until the next day to do so.\n\nPennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said she is going to strongly urge counties to start pre-canvassing the ballots on Election Day. \"It's going to take a while, and the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish,\" she said.\n\nGreene County in the southwestern part of the state said in a news release that it plans to start counting the absentee and mail-in ballots the day after the election as well.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\nErie County restricts activities of openly armed residents near polls\n\nIndividuals with a legal right to carry a firearm can wear one when they step up to the voting machine or ballot box in Erie County on Tuesday.\n\nBut the county Election Board has taken what the board's chairman said is a reasonable step toward preventing the possibility of armed intimidation at Erie County's 149 voting precincts by keeping open-carry voters at least 100 feet from a place where votes are cast.\n\nMembers of the Erie County Election Board, who are also members of Erie County Council, approved the rule in a resolution passed at a meeting on Tuesday. Under the resolution, all open-carry voters, unless they are voting, cannot be within 100 feet of a polling place.\n\nThe resolution places the same limitation on any group of open-carry voters, which is defined as two or more people, gathering or congregating at a polling place or drop-off location.\n\n-- Tim Hahn\n\nU.S. Supreme Court leaves in place Pa.'s Nov. 6 deadline for return of absentee ballots\n\nThe Supreme Court refused for a second time Wednesday to change Pennsylvania's election rules at the 11th hour, handing state Republicans a defeat in their effort to reimpose an Election Day deadline for the return of absentee ballots.\n\nThe unsigned order means that for now, ballots received by Nov. 6 will be counted. But ballots received after polls close on Tuesday will be segregated from those received earlier, and if the state turns out to be pivotal, the high court could consider the state GOP's challenge after the election.\n\nNew Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate \"because of the need for a prompt resolution of it and because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings,\" court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said. That is not the same as a recusal, which Democrats have called for in light of President Donald Trump's expressed desire to have Barrett rule in election cases.\n\nThe action came a week after the justices first let stand the extension set by the state Supreme Court. The vote in that dispute was 4-4, with Roberts and the court's three liberal justices refusing to block the state court's action.\n\n-- Richard Wolf, USA Today\n\nReport warns that PA is at high risk for activity by armed groups around election\n\nA new report says that Pennsylvania is one of five states at a high risk for activity by armed groups of civilians around the Nov. 3 election.\n\nThe Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) and MilitiaWatch warned about such movements leading up to and following the election in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Oregon, especially in state capitals and surrounding towns, medium-sized cities and suburban areas.\n\n“Militia groups and other armed non-state actors pose a serious threat to the safety and security of American voters,” the report said. “Throughout the summer and leading up to the general election, these groups have become more assertive, with activities ranging from intervening in protests to organizing kidnapping plots targeting elected officials.”\n\nThe report, titled “Standing By: Right-Wing Militia Groups and the US Election,” takes its name from President Donald Trump’s response in a recent debate when he was asked to condemn white nationalist groups and militias. Instead, Trump told one such group, the Proud Boys, to, “Stand back and stand by,” which several right-wing groups took as encouragement.\n\nArmed groups use “hybrid tactics” ranging from training for urban and rural combat to using public relations and propaganda to acting as “security operations” for events.\n\n-- J.D.

Durant said he will not back either of the remaining candidates for the GOP nomination for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby. The June 21 runoff pits Katie Britt, Shelby’s former chief of staff and former leader of a state business group, against U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, who resurrected his campaign after losing ex-President Donald Trump’s backing. Durant said the choices are a candidate who has “been in the public office for 40 years” and another he called “really not qualified” and accused of running an ethically challenged campaign that distorted his views. “That’s what people have to decide. Unfortunately, it’s not a great option,” he said. Durant is the owner of an aerospace company but best known as the helicopter pilot who was held captive in Somalia during the 1993 battle chronicled in “Black Hawk Down.” With his military background, Durant entered the race with a splash but ultimately ended in third place. He said his first foray into politics was a disenchanting one and will also be his last. He blamed his campaign’s demise on a bombardment of negative ads he called “blatant” mistruths. “If people say, well, ‘that’s just politics’ – well, then don’t complain about what we have in Washington. That’s not politics. Wrong is wrong,” Durant said.\n\nAlaska\n\nRuby: An Iditarod sled dog was found safe after disappearing from a checkpoint in the race three months ago and covering nearly 150 miles, the Iditarod Trail Committee said Saturday. Musher Sebastien Dos Santos Borges, of France, was picking Leon up and returning with him to France, the trail committee said in a statement. Leon went missing in March after what the trail committee said was his “escape” from the Ruby checkpoint. In May, residents of the Alaska city of McGrath, over 120 miles south of the checkpoint, reported to race director Mark Nordman that they’d seen Leon frequently near a cabin. The resident of the cabin and another musher left food for Leon in the hopes of catching him, according to the trail committee. He was captured early Saturday morning and was safe, alert and “understandably skinny but seemingly healthy,” said Iditarod spokesperson Shannon Markley. Leon was expected to see a veterinarian in the coming days and needs a health certificate before he can fly back to France, Markley said. The nearly 1,000-mile race across Alaska began March 6 just north of Anchorage. The route took mushers along Alaska’s untamed and unforgiving wilderness, including two mountain ranges, the frozen Yukon River and Bering Sea ice along the state’s western coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A lawyer for the Arizona Republican Party and its firebrand leader, Kelli Ward, urged a judge Friday to invalidate the state’s overwhelmingly popular system of mail-in voting, a process used by about 90% of voters. Voting by mail is inconsistent with the Arizona Constitution’s requirement for a secret ballot, attorney Alex Kolodin argued. He urged a Mohave County judge to ban the practice for nearly all voters in the 2022 general election in November – but not for the primary in August, for which ballots are scheduled to be mailed next month. The case is the latest in a multipronged effort by Ward and the state GOP to roll back a system of no-excuse absentee voting that the GOP-controlled Legislature has adopted since 1991. They’ve pushed to require most people to cast a ballot in person on Election Day as ex-President Donald Trump repeats the lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud in Arizona and other battleground states. Only the voters, not the Legislature, can authorize mail voting by amending the constitution, Kolodin argued. Lawyers for state and county election officials as well as the Arizona Democratic Party said the vote-by-mail laws have plenty of secrecy safeguards built in, and nothing in the state constitution prohibits the Legislature from allowing citizens to vote that way.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Local organizations are coming together to celebrate Juneteenth, offering events throughout the holiday weekend. 64.6 Downtown and the Fort Smith Roundtable are partnering to offer the city free live music Thursday, June 16, and Sunday, June 19. Juneteenth occurs on June 19 and celebrates the day in 1865 when Galveston, Texas, slaves learned of their freedom, about 21/ 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. This marks the second year that Juneteenth has been recognized as a federal holiday. “So now that it is a federally recognized holiday we feel it’s important for the city to show a consistent, organized celebration,” said Clifton Culpepper, with the Fort Smith Round Table. The city of Fort Smith, Walmart, the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith and Punkin Pictures also partnered to put on Juneteenth events Friday, June 17, and Saturday, June 18, according to a press release. At 6 p.m. Friday, the organizations will present the Making History Gala at Freedom Farms. The evening will include a cocktail hour and dinner by Chef James Thomas of The Rialto Restaurant. There will also be performances by local and regional musicians. The play “A Raisin in the Sun” will debut at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is spending $11 million on education programs promoting wider use of “red flag” laws that are designed to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed at risk of harming themselves or others, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday. The money was included in the state budget he approved nearly a year ago, but the programs are now getting underway. Newsom announced the funding on National Gun Violence Awareness Day and as he continued promoting California’s gun control efforts as a national model in response to recent mass shootings, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Uvalde, Texas; and Buffalo, New York. California approved its red flag law in 2014 after an earlier mass shooting. It allows police, loved ones and others to ask judges to approve what are formally known as gun violence restraining orders that temporarily bar someone from possessing firearms if they are found to be a risk to themselves or others. Similar intervention programs are in 19 states and the District of Columbia. But a report last year by the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis Health said most people aren’t aware that the orders are an option. The new 18-month outreach program is designed to expand their use.\n\nColorado\n\nLakewood: Investigators say the state’s second-largest wildfire on record was human-caused. The U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that the determination was made based on evidence gathered at the origin of the East Troublesome Fire, but it’s still unclear exactly how the blaze started. “Given the location and time of year that the fire started, it may have been caused by a hunter or a backcountry camper, and possibly by accident,” the agency said in a news release, adding that the investigation is ongoing. The fire was reported Oct. 14, 2020, and high winds and drought conditions allowed it to quickly spread through dead and fallen beetle-killed trees. The fire came dangerously close to the town of Estes Park near Rocky Mountain National Park before it was slowed by a late October snowstorm. More than 350 homes were destroyed in the blaze, which scorched more than 300 square miles.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: A federal appeals court has upheld part of a 2020 police accountability law that allows public disclosure of state trooper personnel files and internal investigations. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Thursday rejected a challenge by the Connecticut State Police Union, which argued the law violates the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions to state freedom of information laws. The contract section in question says troopers’ personnel files and documents in internal investigations that end with no finding of wrongdoing are not subject to disclosure. A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a lower court ruling against the union. “Because we conclude that the law the union sought to enjoin was reasonable and necessary to achieve a legitimate public purpose, we identify no error in the District Court’s legal or factual conclusions,” the panel wrote. Proponents of the 2020 law said it answered the calls for reform after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people. It also created a new state inspector general to investigate police use-of-force cases statewide, limited circumstances in which deadly use of force can be justified, and allowed lawsuits in state courts against officers in certain cases.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers on Thursday announced plans to pass major gun reform in the final weeks of the legislative session, including banning the sale of semi-automatic weapons, limiting high-capacity magazines and increasing the purchasing age for most firearms. It comes after a number of mass shootings in America, most notably in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman shot and killed 19 elementary school children and two teachers. Thursday’s announcement showed movement among Delaware Democrats, who in recent years found themselves at a standoff on several gun reform issues. The package of bills, which has the support of Gov. John Carney, also includes strengthening background checks by reinstituting the Firearm Transaction Approval Program; holding gun manufacturers and dealers liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence; and banning the use of devices that convert handguns into fully automatic weapons. The bill to limit high-capacity magazines shows a significant shift among House lawmakers, who had previously received criticism on this issue. Last year, the Senate passed a bill that would have defined and banned “large-capacity magazines” with a capacity to hold more than 17 rounds of ammunition. House lawmakers added an amendment that would allow for the ownership of large-capacity magazines but include a stricter punishment if used in a crime. It also changed the definition of what the bill defined as a “large-capacity magazine.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A U.S. Capitol Police officer was indicted on federal civil rights charges after he was involved in an unauthorized high-speed chase, crashed into a motorcycle and then tried to cover it up, prosecutors said Friday. The officer, Thomas Smith, was supposed to be checking on the homes of members of Congress in Georgetown about 11:30 p.m. June 20, 2020, when he started pursuing two motorcycles. Prosecutors say he “followed closely behind these vehicles at a high rate of speed” before he swerved his marked patrol car into one of the motorcycles, sending the driver flying into the air. U.S. Capitol Police policy prohibits officers from pursuits outside the grounds of the Capitol without permission from a supervisor. Smith did not seek any approval and did not alert dispatchers that he was involved in a chase, prosecutors say. Authorities allege he drove around the man, leaving the victim lying in the roadway, and fled from the scene. Prosecutors say Smith “knowingly drove away from the scene of the crash without rendering aid, alerting medical authorities, and taking any other reasonable steps to obtain help for the victim.” He then drove back to a Capitol Police parking garage, parked the damaged police sedan, falsified a report to say he had started his shift later, and went inside and got keys for another vehicle, prosecutors said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials have asked the state medical board to draft new policies that would likely restrict gender dysphoria treatments for transgender youth as Florida amps up its ongoing attacks on the treatments amid the country’s culture wars. The officials are also arguing that such treatments should not be covered by Medicaid. In a lengthy report dated Thursday, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration said puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery have not been proven safe or effective in treating gender dysphoria. Tom Wallace, the state’s deputy director of Medicaid, signed off on the report. In response, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo wrote a letter to the state Board of Medicine asking it to review the findings and establish new standards for children seeking “these complex and irreversible procedures.” “Florida must do more to protect children from politics-based medicine,” Ladapo wrote. Many doctors and mental health specialists argue that medical treatment for transgender children is safe and beneficial and can improve their well-being, although rigorous long-term research on benefits and risks is lacking. Federal guidelines say gender-affirming care is crucial to the health and well-being of transgender and nonbinary children. Last year, the American Medical Association issued a letter urging governors to block any legislation prohibiting the treatment, calling such action “a dangerous intrusion into the practice of medicine.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Mayor Andre Dickens wants to spend $20 million to improve and subsidize child care and preschool in Atlanta. The money would include $5 million from the city, $5 million from the city’s public school system and $10 million from private donors, Dickens told WABE-FM. On Friday, the Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students announced a $4.5 million pledge from the Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation and United Way of Greater Atlanta to help pay for the plan. The city will use federal pandemic relief money to pay for its $5 million. The money will pay to refurbish child care centers, to help families afford child care and to pay teachers bonuses. Dickens said many child care facilities haven’t been able to afford necessary repairs. “To get them up to par, we’re asking those child care centers – particularly on the south side of town, a lot of disinvested places – come to us, and we’ll give you grants to improve and modernize,” he said. The average monthly cost of child care in Georgia is about $1,000 per child. Courtney English, the mayor’s senior policy advisor, said that’s unaffordable for many families.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has set a new sentencing date for former state Rep. Ty Cullen, who earlier this year pleaded guilty to one felony count in connection with his acceptance of bribes when he was a lawmaker. He’s now due to be sentenced Oct. 20 instead of July 5. Cullen’s attorney, Birney Bervar, declined to comment. Former Senate Majority Leader Kalani English, who also pleaded guilty in a related case, is still scheduled to be sentenced July 5. The two Democrats each face up to 20 years in prison, but their sentences will depend on various factors. It’s possible they will get less because they pleaded guilty early. Cullen resigned his House seat representing Waipahu less than an hour before prosecutors announced the allegations in February. He entered a guilty plea the following week. His plea agreement with prosecutors says he accepted cash payments from a business owner identified as “Person A” dating as far back as 2014. That year, Cullen received $22,000 worth of casino chips from the business owner during a trip to a wastewater conference in New Orleans. The following year, Cullen introduced a bill as a favor to “Person A” that provided for a feasibility study and pilot project for the collection and treatment of wastewater, the agreement said, resulting in “Person A’s” company receiving a subcontract. The agreement says the business owner gave Cullen four cash payments totaling $23,000 on separate occasions from September 2019 through March 2020.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service violated environmental laws in approving exploratory drilling by a Canadian company hoping to build a gold mine west of Yellowstone National Park, two environmental groups said. The Idaho Conservation League and Greater Yellowstone Coalition filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to stop Excellon Idaho Gold’s Kilgore Gold Exploration Project in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Clark County. The groups cite potential harm to grizzly bears, wolverines, lynx, bighorn sheep, whitebark pine trees, Columbia spotted frogs and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Grizzly bears in the area are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and whitebark pine, a grizzly bear food source, has been proposed for listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Excellon Idaho Gold is a subsidiary of Toronto, Ontario-based Excellon Resources Inc. It acquired the project from British Columbia-based Otis Gold Corporation in 2020. Otis Gold Corporation said the area contains at least 825,000 ounces of gold near the surface and potentially more below. It said it was looking at possibly building an open-pit mine, if exploration finds that the gold is mostly near the surface, or an underground mine, if the gold is deeper. Those types of mines would require additional approval from the Forest Service.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Six candidates seeking the Republican nomination for governor support armed guards at schools and expanded mental health services to stop mass shootings like the ones at Ulvalde, Texas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the past two weeks. The candidates seeking the GOP nomination met in an hourlong televised debate Thursday night sponsored by WLS-TV, Univision and the League of Women Voters of Illinois. Darren Bailey, Richard Irvin, Max Solomon, Gary Rabine, Paul Schimpf and Jesse Sullivan will meet in the June 28 primary election to determine who will face the Democratic victor. Incumbent Gov. J.B. Pritzker is seeking a second term and is challenged by Chicago activist Beverly Miles.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All five judges on the state Supreme Court have sided with Gov. Eric Holcomb in a lawsuit that claimed a piece of legislation giving the General Assembly the ability to call itself into special sessions was unconstitutional. Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office were at odds over House Bill 1123, which was passed in the Statehouse in 2021. It gives the Legislature the power to start a session after the governor has declared an emergency. Holcomb vetoed it last year, claiming it went against the Indiana Constitution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto. “Government should serve as a steady foundation during a time of crisis,” Holcomb wrote in a letter to House Speaker Todd Huston in 2021, after the veto. “Avoidable legal challenges during a state of emergency will only serve to be disruptive to our state.” Meanwhile, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement Friday that the court had overstepped its authority in his view. “The Indiana Supreme Court provided answers to several areas of the law that the governor questioned,” Rokita wrote. “But in doing so, the court became a legislature today by overriding the intent of those who are directly elected by the people.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man who fatally shot two women before killing himself in the parking lot of a church had been romantically involved with one of the women and faced a court hearing this week on a charge of harassing her, investigators said Friday. Johnathan Lee Whitlatch, 33, of Boone, pulled up in a pickup truck to 22-year-old Eden Montang, 21-year-old Vivian Flores and another woman just before 7 p.m. Thursday outside Cornerstone Church on the outskirts of Ames and began shooting with a 9 mm handgun, they said. Montang and Flores were killed, Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald said, and Whitlatch shot himself. The women were friends and students at Iowa State University who were walking together to the church for a weekly service that is popular with university and high school students, the sheriff said. Whitlatch and Montang had recently broken up, Fitzgerald said, and investigators believe Whitlach’s intent was to kill her. “He was there for a specific purpose, which he accomplished,” the sheriff said. About 80 other students were inside the megachurch at the time, Fitzgerald said. The church is near Interstate 35, about 30 miles north of Des Moines. “Our hearts break for all involved, and we are praying for everyone affected, especially the family of the victims,” the church said in the statement. It held a prayer service for the victims Friday morning.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer did not use excessive force while arresting a man during a traffic stop four years ago, a federal grand jury ruled Thursday. Timothy Harris, who is Black, had alleged in the lawsuit that Officer Christopher Janes, who is white, violated his civil rights Jan. 23, 2018, by throwing him to the ground, punching him, and using pepper spray while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. Harris suffered a broken jaw and scrapes during the arrest. He was later convicted of parallel parking too far away from the curb and interference with a law enforcement officer. In closing arguments Thursday, Harris’ attorney, Carlton Odim, said Harris was not resisting arrest, and Janes became frustrated after Harris made what he considered a sarcastic remark to the officer, WIBW reports. But Janes’ attorney, Allen Glendenning, said bodycam video from the arrest showed that Harris was actively resisting and had displayed several “pre-attack” behaviors police are trained to look for during an arrest. U.S. District Judge Dan Crabtree issued an order late Thursday afternoon requiring Harris to cover Janes’ costs, including attorney fees. Harris had sued Janes for $1 million plus his own expenses. The most recent court document available, submitted in mid-January, put Janes’ expenses at $37,688.05 and Harris’ at $197,120.55.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A new campaign aims to get a U.S. postage stamp made in Muhammad Ali’s honor. Prominent figures like Louisville Mayor Greg Fisher and Lonnie Ali, the widow of the humanitarian and boxing great, launched a campaign Friday to have the U.S. Postal Service create a stamp bearing an image of “The Greatest.” “What better day than June 3, when Muhammad passed, to bring attention to this great honor that we really think he deserves,” Annie Moore, senior manager of content and communications of the Ali Center, said at a press conference there. And as Ali once said: “I should be a postage stamp. That’s the only way I’ll ever get licked.” A person must be dead for at least three years before they can become the subject of a postage stamp, and Ali passed six years ago. “The U.S. Postal Service stamp program honors members, extraordinary individuals who have contributed to American society, history, culture and environment,” said Fischer, who was appearing via Zoom from the U.S. Mayor’s Conference in Nevada. “Muhammad Ali more than meets the criteria in place.” There isn’t a proposal for what the stamp could look like, and Ali Center board member Peter Villegas said by Zoom that the selection process could take up to three years. The campaign will use social media to encourage people to back the effort.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: House-passed legislation to erase Robert E. Lee Day and Confederate Memorial Day from a list of Louisiana holidays was approved 28-4 on Friday by the state Senate. The measure by state Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, awaited a final House vote on non-controversial language changes before going to Gov. John Bel Edwards for his signature. The legislative session is set to end Monday. Neither of the holidays has been officially observed by state government in years. Backers of the bill said the holidays should be wiped from state law because they commemorated slavery and white supremacy. Handling the bill on the Senate floor, Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, disputed arguments from opponents of the bill that the holidays are part of state history. “It is important for us to realize that there is a way to commemorate history without glorifying the atrocities,” Luneau said. The two holidays are among those on a list of holidays a governor can proclaim in addition to permanent holidays that include Christmas and Independence Day. The governor is limited in the number he can proclaim in a year. Nobody spoke against the bill on the Senate floor Friday, but there was one significant change, nixing language eliminating George Washington’s birthday from the optional list in deference to the federal President’s Day holiday.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center is opening a breast milk donation center as the U.S. continues to deal with a baby formula shortage. The hospital said the breast milk center will open Monday in partnership with a regional milk bank. It’s the first in the Bangor area. A milk bank collects milk from mothers who have more than their babies need. There are a half-dozen other breast milk banks located between Portland and Belfast. The baby formula shortage largely stems from a plant in Michigan, which the FDA shut down in February due to contamination issues. The Biden administration’s response calls for importing foreign supplies and using the Defense Production Act to speed domestic production.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A challenge coin inscribed with the Maryland State Police logo along with graphic imagery and offensive language has some troopers concerned because they see it as a potential response to allegations of racial discrimination within the agency. The Baltimore Sun reports photos of the coin obtained by the newspaper show the state police insignia with images of female anatomy and references to people being offended. Challenge coins are tokens that people in organizations such as law enforcement collect to commemorate events or membership. Maryland State Police became aware of the coin in January, and the agency is investigating its creation, including whether someone in the agency was involved with the coins’ “design, manufacturing/purchase or sale,” spokeswoman Elena Russo said in an email. Russo said the agency hasn’t identified the person “responsible for this violation of Department policy” and urged anyone with information to contact internal affairs. Investigations of other coins have led to disciplinary or administrative actions, she said. The coin is being interpreted as a reaction to issues raised by Black troopers about disparate treatment around discipline, hiring and promotions and racist incidents within the agency, according to leaders of the Coalition of Black Maryland State Troopers and the Randallstown NAACP.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Democrats gathered in the city for their state party convention Saturday as they seek to regain the governor’s office and retain control of virtually every other source of political power in the state. Attorney General Maura Healey and state Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz are both hoping to win the top office in November, but they must first go head-to-head in the fall primary. Healey won the party’s endorsement with 71% of the delegate votes Saturday, while Chang-Díaz won 29%, enough to get her name on the September primary ballot. “I am so so humbled, and I promise you this: I will be a governor who sees everyone, who listens to everyone and who makes sure that every voice in this commonwealth is heard,” Healey said in accepting the endorsement. Healey and Chang-Díaz are both popular among the party faithful, although Healey has the benefit of having run statewide twice – winning both times. Healey also has a financial edge. As of the beginning of May, she had more than $4.9 million in cash in her campaign account, compared to just $353,000 for Chang-Díaz. Either candidate would make history if they win in November. Despite its liberal reputation, Massachusetts has never elected a woman as governor. Healey would also become the state’s first openly gay candidate elected governor and the nation’s first openly lesbian chief executive of a state, while Chang-Díaz would be the first Latina and Asian American to hold the office.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Two candidates for governor, including a business consultant willing to spend personal millions, lost their final appeals Friday and will remain off the ballot in the Republican primary, the result of phony petition signatures that left them short of the 15,000 threshold. The state Supreme Court was the last stop for Perry Johnson and Michael Markey, who were doomed by forged signatures apparently created by paid circulators without the candidates’ knowledge. After state officials scratched those names, Johnson and Markey didn’t have enough valid ones. Detroit’s former police chief, James Craig, is in the same category. The state Supreme Court rejected his appeal on narrow procedural grounds, saying he first needed to go to the Michigan Court of Appeals. Nonetheless, he, too, will likely stay off the Aug. 2 ballot. “Today was the statutory deadline for ballots to be finalized. ... They are going to begin the printing process now,” said Tracy Wimmer, spokeswoman at the secretary of state’s office. The state elections bureau described widespread evidence of fraudulent signatures, names of dead voters and wrong addresses in a May 23 report – a conclusion that rocked the crowded field of GOP candidates vying to challenge Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A garbage company has stopped picking up yard waste in at least seven metropolitan cities due to a lack of drivers. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports Waste Management confirmed Thursday that it had suspended yard waste service in Robbinsdale, Stillwater, Columbia Heights, Little Canada, St. Anthony, St. Paul and Vadnais Heights due to a staffing shortage. Company spokeswoman Julie Ketchum said high demand for people with commercial driver’s licenses has created the shortage. She said the yard waste pickup suspensions could last weeks and could expand to other cities going forward.\n\nMississippi\n\nHernando: A flyer on behalf of the Ku Klux Klan was reportedly left on the steps of a mostly Black church in rural Mississippi. According to a community member’s Facebook post, the flyer is in support of “The Old Glory Knights of the Ku Klux Klan” and says the group is “alive and growing” in 14 states, including Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and South Carolina. It was found May 29 on the steps of Union Hill Missionary Baptist Church in Hernando, in DeSoto County, the post said. The Old Glory Knights are a Klan chapter that appeared sometime last year, said Lydia Bates, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center. They have distributed flyers in the past, but flyer campaigns, Bates said, do not always mean the group is active. “Flyering is such a low-cost, low-stakes way to get their messaging out there to intimidate people, to attempt to recruit people,” Bates said. Flyering efforts by the KKK have dropped recently, going from more than 40 incidents in 2020 to fewer than 30 in 2021. Still, Bates said, the flyers can be scary for communities. A big goal of the flyers is to intimidate and make people think the Klan is bigger and stronger than it is in reality, she said. “A hate group built on a 150-plus year history of violence, you can’t dismiss it ... because there is violence in their words inherently,” Bates said.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A lawsuit challenging state control of the city’s police department will proceed after a Jackson County judge declined last week to dismiss it. Gwendolyn Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, contends in the lawsuit against the Kansas City Police Board of Commissioners that state control of the city’s police department is discriminatory and prevents Kansas City residents from having a say in how millions of tax dollars are spent in their city, The Kansas City Star reports. The board consists of the Kansas City mayor and four members appointed by Missouri’s governor. Kansas City is the only city in the state with a police department controlled by a state board. The current arrangement constitutes “taxation without representation” and violates Missouri’s Hancock Amendment, which limits state revenues and local taxes, Grant argues in the lawsuit. She also argues the current system is discriminatory because it involves a city with a large Black population. “The Court’s denial of the Police Board’s motion to dismiss clears the way for a long-overdue constitutional challenge to this antiquated system, and the antiquated values it represents,” Grant said in a lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nBonner: Stat wildlife officials captured two young female sibling grizzly bears, releasing one back into the wild and euthanizing the other due to an infection stemming from losing a front left paw. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Friday it captured the 2-year-old females May 29 after they remained close to homes in the Blackfoot Valley about 10 miles from the town of Bonner in western Montana. The agency said the healthy sibling weighed about 130 pounds and the other about 90 pounds. The healthy grizzly was fitted with a radio collar and released into an undisclosed location. It’s not clear how the injured grizzly lost its paw, but a bicyclist found a grizzly bear paw April 11 on a road where, last fall, a sow grizzly and three yearling cubs had been seen. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Bear Manager Jamie Jonkel told The Missoulian that the agency is waiting on DNA results to see if the captured bears were part of the family group that included a male sibling. The mother grizzly had been known to raid sheds and garages north of Missoula. There have been no reports on the mother or male sibling this spring.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jim Pillen scored the endorsement Thursday of the Nebraska Cattlemen, a top advocacy group for the state’s ranchers. Pillen, a veterinarian and the owner of a hog farm operation, is running to replace current Gov. Pete Ricketts, a fellow Republican who leaves office in January because of term limits. Brenda Masek, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Cattlemen’s political action committee, said Pillen has “walked in our shoes” as an agricultural producer and would be a strong advocate for the industry at the Capitol. “Jim understands the concerns of the agriculture industry because he experiences them firsthand,” Masek said in a statement. Pillen is running against state Sen. Carol Blood, a Democrat and former Bellevue City Council member who was born and raised on a farm and has worked on various agricultural issues in the Legislature. Pillen won Nebraska’s Republican primary last month out of a crowded field that included an opponent backed by ex-President Donald Trump. Before he won the primary, Pillen secured support from Ricketts and the Nebraska Farm Bureau.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One of the busiest interchanges on the busiest freeway in the state is getting a three-year remake that transportation and elected officials say will ease access to Allegiant Stadium, T-Mobile Arena and the resort-lined Las Vegas Strip – but only after construction creates an even bigger traffic headache. “Will there be some minor inconvenience for a couple of years? Absolutely, there will be,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at a ceremony last week marking the start of $305 million worth of work to upgrade Interstate 15 and Tropicana Avenue. “I think the short-term sacrifice for the long-term gain is going to be something that we’re all really happy with,” the governor said. His comments were reported by the Las Vegas Sun. He called the interchange “the gateway to the entertainment and sports capital of the world.” Buttigieg credited Nevada with taking quick advantage of a federal infrastructure funding measure passed last year. It is expected to pay $25 million toward the project. Another $50 million comes from a federal grant awarded in 2020, and the state is expected to spend $230 million, mostly derived from fuel taxes, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Buttigieg said the project will improve a road designed long before the city looked the way it does today.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Education on Friday announced an initiative for children and parents to find a moment in their hectic schedules to pause, take a break and share that time with others. It’s called the “603 Moment” campaign, reflecting the state’s area code and the June 3 start. Gov. Chris Sununu planned its launch at a New Hampshire Fisher Cats baseball game, distributing small whiteboards to patrons and encouraging them to share their moment in writing. The initiative advertises, “Reset. Let Go. Grow.” “Just like the #HomeHikeChallenge from the last two years, our #603Moment initiative seeks to help New Hampshire kids, parents, and families refocus and appreciate the little things in life,” Sununu said in a statement. “Let’s channel these 603 Moments into positive change and renew important discussions on the importance of social and emotional health not just in our schools, but also in our communities.” Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said a moment “can occur on a walk or a lunch break, or perhaps it is a peaceful reflection while visiting a favorite place, or just a few deep breaths while in the midst of chaos.” Residents will be encouraged to share their moment on social media with the hashtag #603Moment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court has overturned a man’s sexual assault conviction because of DNA evidence – not because it exonerated him but because the statute of limitations ran out before the state filed charges once it got a match. Investigators had DNA evidence from the 2001 crime scene and from defendant Bradley Thompson by 2004 but didn’t get a conclusive match until 2016, due to the FBI’s updating of DNA testing guidance. In a 5-0 ruling Thursday with one justice not participating, the Supreme Court held that the five-year statute of limitations should have begun in 2010, when the FBI standards changed and the state lab could have generated a match. Thompson was indicted in 2017 and eventually convicted of criminal sexual contact and criminal trespass. The state had argued that the statute of limitations should have begun in 2016, when it updated its policy to reflect the new FBI guidance and achieved a match with Thompson’s DNA. Two lower courts had agreed. But the high court ruled that under New Jersey law, the statue of limitations began in this case in 2010 – when the state had the capability of matching the crime scene DNA with the defendant’s. If the Legislature meant to have it start when a match was achieved, it would have written that into the law, the court ruled Thursday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal authorities confirmed Friday that they are investigating how three firefighters battling the largest blaze burning in the U.S. were injured – one of them seriously – when a helicopter dropped part of a load of water on them. It happened the last weekend of May in northern New Mexico as a team of firefighters was working along the fire’s perimeter. They were among the more than 3,000 people assigned to the fire, which has been burning for nearly two months. An initial report from the Bureau of Land Management stated that the hotshot crew was holding a section of fire line about 10:30 a.m. in the Pecos Wilderness last Sunday as helicopters dropped water on the fire’s edge. “When a helicopter missed the identified drop area, the last of the load was delivered on top of several crew members,” the report said. Two received minor injuries, and the third underwent several surgeries at an Albuquerque hospital to repair skull fractures and a broken kneecap. The Bureau of Land Management confirmed Friday that an investigation was underway but declined to release any other information. The blaze was the result of two government planned burns aimed at clearing the forest of overgrown and dead vegetation. It destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate from numerous rural villages in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains east of Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: An employee who survived a racist mass shooting at a supermarket sought a court order Friday to question the 18-year-old gunman’s parents under oath in anticipation of filing a lawsuit against them. The filings in state Supreme Court ask that Payton Gendron’s parents, Paul and Pamela Gendron of Conklin, provide depositions by July 29 “to preserve their testimony, frame the complaint, and aid in identifying all possible defendants.” The filings also ask for evidence of the crime to be preserved. Attorney Terrence Connors filed the requests on behalf of Zaire Goodman, one of three people who survived being shot when the gunman opened fire on shoppers and employees at a Tops Friendly Market on May 14. Ten Black people died in the attack. Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said Thursday that only Payton Gendron appeared to be criminally liable for the shooting. Gendron is charged in a 25-count indictment with hate-motivated domestic terrorism, first-degree murder, attempted murder and murder as a hate crime. He has pleaded not guilty. “No one else is on my radar to be charged,” Flynn said after Gendron was arraigned. Goodman’s filing, first reported by The Buffalo News, accuses Gendron’s parents of ignoring warning signs and “remain(ing) willfully blind to their son’s propensity for vicious conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRocky Mount: A historical marker alerting motorists that 1912 two-time Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe once played pro baseball in eastern North Carolina is back up more than two years after it was accidentally torn down. The replacement highway marker honoring Thorpe in downtown Rocky Mount was installed two weeks ago, state Department of Transportation spokesperson Andrew Barksdale told the Rocky Mount Telegram. A Thorpe marker was first installed in 1960 that told passersby that Thorpe came to the city in 1909 to play for the Rocky Mount Railroaders. Thorpe, a Sac and Fox/Potawatomi citizen, was stripped of his gold medals for the pentathlon and decathlon after losing his amateur status based on playing baseball in North Carolina. His medals were restored in the early 1980s, about 30 years after his death. The marker was reported missing in late 2019. It turned out the marker had been accidentally struck by a contract mowing service, which agreed to pay for a replacement, the newspaper reports. The replacement was ordered in May 2021, but delays occurred due to foundry staffing shortages and backup marker requests, according to Ansley Wegner, the state Highway Historical Marker Program administrator. “I’m glad to know that it is back in place and doing its job,” Wegner said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Supreme Court has rejected a last-ditch attempt to keep Dakota Access Pipeline construction security records private. The Bismarck Tribune reports the case involves documents the pipeline’s security overseer, TigerSwan, gave to the state’s Private Investigation and Security Board during a dispute over whether the North Carolina company operated illegally in North Dakota. That issue was resolved in September 2020 when the company agreed to pay the board a $175,000 settlement. The Intercept online news organization sued in November 2020 to obtain the documents. The pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer, has argued the documents are confidential. The state Supreme Court ruled in late April that they’re public records since the security board received them for use in public business. The Tribune reports that Energy Transfer asked the court May 12 to rehear the case. The justices refused in a May 23 order that did not explain their reasoning. Rehearings are rare for the Supreme Court. The justices last granted one in 2013, and then only to correct a misstatement in an opinion.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s new law allowing adults to carry concealed firearms without training classes or background checks goes into effect June 13. Gov. Mike DeWine signed the measure in March that marks one of the most significant changes to Ohio gun policy in more than 20 years. The new law gives people 21 or older who are legally allowed to own a gun permission to conceal that weapon without training or a permit. Gun owners may still opt to get a permit if they want to carry concealed firearms in other states where licenses are required. Ohio has agreements with more than three dozen states that allow residents to carry concealed guns elsewhere. The new law also eliminates the requirement that those carrying guns “promptly” inform law enforcement when stopped. Instead, the gun owner will have to inform only when an officer asks if the person is carrying a weapon. Ohio first passed a concealed carry weapons permit law in 2004. Since then, it’s been enormously popular, and Ohio lawmakers have shaved down training requirements and expanded places where permit holders may carry. The state doesn’t consider the total number of active license holders a public record, but an analysis from 2019 estimated that about 673,000 Ohioans have a permit, or 1 in 17.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The state’s black bear population continues to grow by 6% each year, and early summer means more bear encounters with people. Reported bear sightings increase in early summer, especially in eastern and central Oklahoma. A year ago in late May, a bear wandered into Norman. The animal was killed by state wildlife officials after attempts to tranquilize it failed. In most cases when bears wander into an Oklahoma town, the animals are tranquilized, captured and relocated by state wildlife officials. It is believed the bear in Norman traveled from southeastern Oklahoma, which has the largest population of bears in the state. Over the years, there have been other bear sightings across the state in early summer, even one that crossed Interstate 35. “These bears are likely young males traveling long distances, up to 80 miles one way, in search of females,” said Jeff Ford, senior wildlife biologist for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. “So whether you live in bear habitat or in the western reaches of their range, it is important to be bear wise.” Bears roam at night, and food left out such as birdseed, dog food and garbage are their frequent fast-food stops. It is estimated a black bear can smell food a mile away.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Residents of an affordable housing complex say their living conditions are inhospitable, and they want their rent back. Tenants at the Allen Fremont Plaza in Northeast Portland gathered in the courtyard of the three-story complex Wednesday, describing mold, vermin and people who don’t live there camping in the building’s indoor common areas, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Tenants Gary Bailey, John Brant, Huey Martin, Cathy Mayes and Lisa McConnell have filed lawsuits against Reach Community Development Corp. in Multnomah County Circuit Court. The affordable housing provider, which took over operations of the building seven years ago, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Emily Templeton, the attorney who filed the pro-bono suits, said each plaintiff is seeking a $14,400 refund for the rent paid, as well as a court order to fix the issues. The suit is limited to problems from the past year, but the documented complaints date back to 2013, she said. “This lawsuit is to just push the executives at Reach to finally do something,” Templeton said. Residents are also concerned with accumulation of trash, exposed wiring, the lack of an on-site manager, drug dealing and substance use, ineffective ventilation, fire hazards and inadequate weatherproofing, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick has conceded the Republican primary for U.S. Senate to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, ending his campaign as he acknowledged an ongoing statewide recount wouldn’t give him enough votes to make up the deficit. After a bitter campaign that blanketed the airwaves with millions of dollars in attack ads, McCormick issued a gracious concession Friday, vowing to help unite the party behind Oz. “It’s now clear to me with the recount largely complete that we have a nominee,” McCormick said at a campaign party at a Pittsburgh hotel. “And today I called Mehmet Oz to congratulate him on his victory.” McCormick’s concession cements a general election campaign between Oz, who was endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump, and Democrat John Fetterman in what is expected to be one of the nation’s premier Senate contests. Already, the national parties are sponsoring attack ads on TV in a presidential battleground state that is still roiled by Trump’s baseless claims of a stolen election in 2020. The result could help determine control of the closely divided chamber, and Democrats view it as perhaps their best opportunity to pick up a seat in the race to replace retiring two-term Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Environmental officials are urging residents to avoid a stretch of the Blackstone River after finding that sewage was leaking into the river from a wastewater treatment plant Sunday. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said it’s investigating the discharge of partly treated wastewater from the Woonsocket Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility. Officials said they were made aware of the discharge Sunday morning, and it is “currently ongoing.” Residents are being urged to avoid swimming, boating or fishing in the river from Cumberland Hill Road in Woonsocket to the Slater Mill Dam in Pawtucket. The advisory will remain in effect until further notice. The treatment plant is operated by the private firm Jacobs and treats about 10 million gallons of sewage a day, according to the department. The agency said it previously issued letters of noncompliance to the facility in November 2021 and March 2022 regarding “operations and maintenance concerns.” Jacobs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: At least some of the five Democrats seeking their party’s gubernatorial nomination are expected to debate, just more than a week before the state’s primary elections. The South Carolina Democratic Party announced Friday that it had sanctioned the production of the debate, to be co-hosted by South Carolina Educational Television and The Post and Courier newspaper of Charleston, for June 10. That’s a day before South Carolina’s Democrats are expected to assemble in Columbia for this year’s state party convention. Whether any of the gubernatorial candidates would debate before the June 14 contest had long been up for debate itself. A broadcast event had been scheduled for June 1, but former U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham’s refusal to commit to it prompted state Sen. Mia McLeod to issue a debate challenge via Twitter so that she and Cunningham could “give the people what they want.” Cunningham responded by saying that he welcomed “a fair debate” but balked at participation in the forum, which was to have been sponsored by the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Black Caucus. Cunningham’s concern was that the chair of that caucus is listed as someone paid by McLeod’s campaign. A review of McLeod’s expenditures lists chairman Brandon Upson as having been paid $900 by the campaign, remuneration Upson has said was tied to the campaign’s purchase of a list of about 100,000 names to be used for fundraising.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Backers of legal marijuana in the state are also fighting a different, unrelated ballot measure that would make it harder for voters to raise taxes and government spending. Amendment C, which voters will see on this week’s ballot, would have no bearing on a separate measure that will go to voters in November to legalize cannabis. If passed, Amendment C would require future ballot measures that increase taxes or government spending by $10 million over five years to receive a 60% majority. But increased spending and tax increases aren’t associated with Initiated Measure 27, the official name of the cannabis ballot measure on the November ballot. According to a fiscal impact statement associated with IM27, the measure isn’t expected to cost the state of South Dakota a dime. In fact, the state might save money. “There would be decreased expenses for the state due to decreased incarceration from the nullification of some marijuana-related laws,” Reed Holwegner, the director of the Legislative Research Council, wrote in what’s formally called a fiscal note that was sent to the Secretary of State’s Office in October. Unlike the last go-round in which the public voted to legalize pot at the polls, IM27 does not establish any regulatory structure around commercial marijuana sales.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city got dragged in the comments Wednesday after officials attempted to rebut a viral TikTok that highlighted Memphis’ persistent problems with potholes. The post by Traynor Jennings III showed him standing waist-deep in what he called a pothole but the city described as erosion from a damaged underground waterline. “Hey, City of Memphis, there are holes like this everywhere,” Jennings said. The TikTok has been viewed about 3 million times, putting the potholes that are ubiquitous throughout Memphis in the harsh glare of the viral spotlight. The city did not take kindly to Jennings’ TikTok and offered a rebuttal Wednesday afternoon. The video “may be funny to watch but was unwise to remove the metal plate and place yourself into the cavity of washed away soil in the middle of the street. Your best bet is to call 311 and report road damage and potholes,” the city said. But that’s not the case, Jennings said. He took to Facebook and the radio show circuit to push back on the city’s claim that he moved a steel plate that likely weighs hundreds of pounds. The city later amended its post and removed the reference to moving the metal plate. A 4-foot-by-4-foot steel plate weighs about 652 pounds, according to onlinemetals.com. Mayor Jim Strickland, in an interview with WREG, apologized for the city’s comments.\n\nTexas\n\nCenterville: The search for a murderer who had killed on behalf of Mexican drug cartels and who stabbed and injured the driver of a prison transport bus last month when he escaped custody ended late Thursday in a shootout about 220 miles away. He led officers on a brief chase in a stolen truck before he was gunned down. Authorities believe while Gonzalo Lopez, 46, roamed free, he killed a man and his four grandsons, then stole an AR-15-style rifle and a pistol from their ranch near Centerville, as well as the truck he drove to Atascosa County, south of San Antonio, where he was fatally shot by officers. “This is something that you can’t imagine ever to happen in a small community like this,” said Tuffy Loftin, 61, a pastor in Centerville who knew the family. Centerville residents had been worried ever since May 12, when Lopez overpowered the officer who was driving him and 15 other prisoners near their community between Dallas and Houston. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice is still investigating how Lopez broke free from his restraints and escaped a caged area of the bus where he had been held. Following his escape, law enforcement had been vigorously patrolling Highway 7 and other roads in Centerville and escorting many of the city’s nearly 1,000 residents to their homes to ensure they felt safe.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A recent study suggests nearly half of the state’s residents are using too much water in an effort to keep their grass healthy. Using aerial photographs depicting lawns in two Utah County cities, then cross-referencing the data with secondary water bills from thousands of anonymous customers, Brigham Young University’s Civil and Construction Engineering professor Rob Sowby’s paper points to widespread overuse in the Beehive State. “The gut reaction is, more water equals more green. But there’s a curve; there’s an optimal point. And as you put more water on, that’s all you’re doing, you’re not making it any healthier,” Sowby told the Deseret News. The overuse is problematic on two fronts – first, the West is battling a historically bad drought. Water districts are enforcing unprecedented water cuts, while the Great Salt Lake and two of the nation’s largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are at all-time lows. Water hawks across the region are warning residents that now is not the time to be using too much water on nonessential landscapes, like a lawn. Second, too much water will harm grass. “Yes, you put more water on, and it gets healthier, but then it peaks out. And as you put more water on, that’s all you’re doing – you’re just wasting water. It doesn’t get any healthier,” Sowby said. An abundance of weeds like crabgrass or thatch, fungal growth like mushrooms, standing water or runoff after irrigation, yellowing and eventually dying patches of grass are all signs of overwatering.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott has vetoed a land conservation bill that supporters say intended to protect biodiversity and improve climate resilience. The legislation set goals of conserving 30% of Vermont land by 2030 and 50% by 2050. Scott, a Republican, wrote in his veto message to lawmakers Thursday that the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources testified multiple times against this bill, saying the conservation goals in it “are unnecessarily tied to – and unreasonably limited to – permanent protection.” “The Agency has repeatedly said that permanent preservation has not been, and cannot be, the state’s exclusive conservation tool and this bill, intentional or not, would diminish the existing and successful conservation tools we have,” Scott wrote. House Speaker Jill Krowinski and House Natural Resources Chair Amy Sheldon said the act was part of a package of environmental legislation that sought to build on the state’s conservation work and help reduce the impact of climate change on communities, and now joins other environmental protection legislation that Scott has vetoed in recent years. Environmental groups also criticized the move. The bill would have created a statewide conservation plan, given the current and future development pressures on Vermont’s landscape, combined with the “historic biodiversity loss and climate change,” the Vermont Natural Resources Council said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: The General Assembly’s recently approved budget appropriates money to create a new state park in Culpeper County that would include two Civil War battlefields. The spending plan sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin last week would create a 1,700-acre park focused on Culpeper County’s Brandy Station and Cedar Mountain battlefields, which have been preserved by the American Battlefield Trust, the Star-Exponent reports. Proponents say Culpeper’s location between Manassas National Battlefield Park and the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park will boost visitation. Many of the sites the Culpeper Battlefields State Park will include are already open to the public, under the stewardship of the battlefield trust or other organizations. “As awe-inspiring as these preserved lands are, we came to realize the wherewithal and marketing muscle of the Virginia State Park System was needed to make the battlefields into a genuine heritage tourism destination and economic engine for the community,” Jim Campi, the battlefield trust’s chief policy and communications officer, told the newspaper. The budget is awaiting action from Youngkin, who has indicated his support for the park, according to the newspaper. Under the budget language, the park would be created by July 1, 2024.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A woman who was struck in the eye with a so-called rubber bullet during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, causing an injury that required surgery, has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Seattle Police Department. Nikita Tarver alleges an officer targeted her – the only Black person in a crowd of white protesters – when she raised a sign showing the names of police violence victims, the Seattle Times reports. Tarver was likely struck with a 40 mm foam-tipped projectile, one of several “less-lethal” weapons a federal judge later enjoined police from using against protesters. The rounds can cause serious injury. Their manufacturer warns against firing them at people’s heads. The lawsuit joins dozens of others filed by protesters who claim police used excessive force against nonviolent demonstrators during the 2020 summer protests. The Seattle city attorney’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit claims Tarver and a friend were walking back to their car when Tarver hoisted a sign. “Within seconds of holding her sign up so that it could be seen, Nikita felt a blast in her left eye,” the lawsuit says. “Nikita screamed out in terror. Her entire face felt like it was burning and she felt like she was going to lose her eye.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is scaling back its community testing events for the coronavirus, Gov. Jim Justice said. Justice said Thursday that the decision was made due to the availability and convenience of at-home test kits for COVID-19. The state has provided free community testing since the start of the pandemic in 2020. People who have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with the virus can still find testing sites at places such as pharmacies and participating health departments and medical centers. “There are still plenty of places out there where you can find access to free testing. But, to be perfectly honest, what’s happening right now with our community testing events is that they’re set up all day, but maybe only two people come by,” Justice said. “We’re just spending money that could be better spent somewhere else right now. That said, if things happen to get worse, we’ll be right back out there.” The state has a map of available testing sites on the Department of Health and Human Resources’ website.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A national meatpacking company with a facility in Green Bay has agreed to pay about $15,000 to settle allegations that unsafe practices during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic sickened and killed Wisconsin workers. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration announced the settlement last week, and it applies to seven JBS Foods USA plants, including the Green Bay facility. The company closed that plant in late April 2020 after nearly 150 infections were linked to it. The plant reopened about a week later. OSHA said that by mid-August, 357 infections had been confirmed at the plant. OSHA cited the plant in October 2020 on grounds that the company didn’t implement timely and effective measures to control the disease’s spread. The agency hailed the settlement as a step toward protecting workers. Jarrett Brown, who worked at the Green Bay plant until early 2020, called the deal a slap on the wrist. “This is not punishment for them,” Brown said. JBS officials said in a statement that they’ve established COVID-19 protocols and plan to implement them across their U.S. facilities.\n\nWyoming\n\nKirby: A local distillery has partnered with Yellowstone National Park to release a limited-edition bourbon in honor of the park’s 150th anniversary. Wyoming Whiskey announced in a press release that its National Parks No. 2 straight bourbon whiskey comes in tandem with the brand’s continuing partnership with Yellowstone Forever, the official nonprofit partner of Yellowstone National Park. The National Parks No. 2 bottle is the second collectible release in an annual national park series that debuted in April 2021. It is now available in Yellowstone National Park and throughout Wyoming and is also available in select U.S. markets and online from ReserveBar, Flaviar and Caskers. The inaugural release of Wyoming Whiskey’s national parks series contributed over $120,000 to the National Park Foundation in 2021. Wyoming Whiskey said it has committed to donating $150,000 to Yellowstone Forever in the park’s historic 150th year. For every bottle sold, the distillery said it will donate $5 up to a maximum donation of $150,000 to support Yellowstone Forever’s preservation mission. The straight bourbon whiskey is made from 68% corn, 20% wheat and 12% malted barley – all Wyoming-made, non-genetically modified grains – and bottled at 105 proof. The company said the water used is sourced from a local limestone aquifer.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/europe/klitschko-brothers-battle-for-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "'A fight between good and evil': The Klitschko brothers on the battle ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko scratches his head after a conference call with another foreign leader, the bags under his eyes revealing the sleepless nights the Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital have afforded him.\n\nNevertheless, he’s undeterred.\n\n“This is our homeland, we have to be here,” he told CNN, in an exclusive face-to-face interview at an undisclosed location on Wednesday.\n\nBeside him, his brother Wladimir shares a similar feeling.\n\n“Our roots are here, our relatives are buried in the ground here, in Kyiv,” Wladimir said. “Our relatives, our friends, every single street brings back memories.”\n\nThe pair, legendary athletes and former world boxing champions, said they didn’t sleep for the first two days of the Russian invasion. One month on, they’ve adjusted, sticking together and using their international clout to muster international support for Ukraine.\n\n“We understand it’s our land, we understand it’s our future, it’s our freedom,” Vitali explained. “We’re ready to fight for that, but we need support from (the) whole democratic world.”\n\n“We need support and help from our allies, we need a lot and it’s almost never enough,” Wladimir added.\n\nAs NATO leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday, he was clear about what he wanted for Ukraine: “We definitely need to close our sky.”\n\n“Our civilians, and our cities are getting destroyed and it’s continuing while we’re giving this interview and speaking about it, the fights are still going on,” Wladimir said.\n\nBut NATO has been unwilling to implement a no-fly zone over his country, so now he’s asking the alliance to give Ukraine the means to do it by itself.\n\n“If you supply us with defensive weapons, we’re going to close the skies on our own,” Wladimir said.\n\n“We have enough men and women that are going to stand for the country and will defend it as strong(ly) and as much as possible,” he added. “We’re going to close the sky on our own, we just need the defensive equipment for that.”\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko (L) and his brother and former Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko speak at a recruitment center in Kyiv in early February. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUkraine has received a lot of defensive lethal aid from the United States and other NATO allies already and more is either arriving or on the way. It’s one of the reasons the Ukrainians have been able to mount such staunch resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces.\n\n“With our friends we are much stronger,” Vitali said, thanking US President Joe Biden in particular, with whom he said he has a “good” personal relationship.\n\nThe two met in 2015, when Biden was the Vice-President and in charge of the United States’ Ukraine policy, and have remained in contact ever since.\n\n“Unity around Ukraine is a key for freedom, it’s a key for peace in our home country. It’s very important to have friends who support Ukraine and one more time thank you so much for (your) support,” Vitali said.\n\nBut support for Ukraine has to be a two-pronged approach, the brothers said, as they called on the West to sever all economic ties with Russia – even if it means paying steeper prices for oil and gas.\n\n“Obviously, the world needs oil and gas, but it’s better to pay (a) higher price than to pay with lives for that oil,” Wladimir said. “One more time, anything that you economically do in trade, or exchange with Russia, you’re getting products, you’re getting gas, oil, the ruble, whatever it is, just stop doing it.”\n\n“You will save lives,” he added. “This way, we will isolate (Putin), make him weaker and just show that international law cannot be broken.”\n\nDefense of Kyiv\n\nThe Ukrainian capital has been one of the main targets of Putin’s invasion, with Russian troops continuing to try to encircle Kyiv. At the start of the conflict, US and NATO officials said they believed Moscow’s goal was to capture the capital and “decapitate” the government, in order to achieve a swift end to the war.\n\nFour weeks later, Ukrainian forces are not only keeping Russian troops at bay, they are making gains around Kyiv.\n\nThe Klitschko brothers understand why the strength of Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russia’s mighty army might have shocked many, but are not themselves surprised.\n\n“I can explain why: Because (the) Russian army is fighting for money, whereas Ukrainian soldiers are fighting for freedom, for children, to defend our families, to defend our future,” Vitali said.\n\n“This is why Ukrainian soldiers are so tough.”\n\nPart of the defense of the capital has been put in the hands of Territorial Defense Forces, which despite being officially integrated into the Ukrainian military, are composed of people with little or no military experience. The mayor’s office has had to organize this militia but Klitschko rejects any credit, instead pinning its success on ordinary Ukrainians who stepped up.\n\n“We didn’t need to organize anything. I meet people at checkpoints and they come from very peaceful professions. These people are artists, musicians, doctors, who have never even thought to wear a uniform or pick up weapons,” Vitali said. “But right now they’re on the street and ready to fight, ready to defend the future of our children, defend freedom in Ukraine.”\n\nAhead of the invasion, Putin accused the Ukrainian government of persecuting Russian speakers, using it as a justification for the attack.\n\nHowever, Moscow’s armies have faced strong opposition even in areas where the majority of the population speaks Russian.\n\nMost have lined up to contribute and help their country in any shape or form.\n\n“Our will is stronger (than) any army and any weapon and that’s why we will succeed and defend our country,” Wladimir said.\n\nReady for the ultimate sacrifice\n\nDespite Ukraine’s initial relative success, the situation across the country continues to be incredibly precarious. Throughout the 30-minute-long conversation, shelling and rocket launches continued around Kyiv and across Ukraine. Missiles fell in multiple towns and firefights ensued.\n\n“Nobody can feel safe in Ukraine right now,” Vitali said. “At any second there could be a bombing attack, a rocket could fall.”\n\n“At any second, every Ukrainian is at risk of dying,” Vitali added, knowing full well that this also applies to the two brothers.\n\nLike President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian officials have said Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are high profile targets for Russian infiltrators seeking to destabilize leadership in the capital.\n\nThe brothers, like many Ukrainians, say they have overcome whatever fear they may have had.\n\n“We’re in Ukraine. We stay with Ukraine, we stay for our future. And we are ready to defend it,” Vitali said. “It’s a privilege to die to defend your hometown, your home country.”\n\nHis brother has also adjusted to that new reality, drawing on what he perceives to be the righteousness of their cause.\n\n“Truth is on our side,” Wladimir said. “This pretty much reminds me of a fairy tale.”\n\n“It’s a fight between good and evil.”", "authors": ["Vasco Cotovio Frederik Pleitgen Byron Blunt", "Vasco Cotovio", "Frederik Pleitgen", "Byron Blunt"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}]}

For the latest news on severe weather across the country, including the Midwest and upstate New York, view USA TODAY's story for Wednesday, July 17.\n\nDamaging thunderstorms and a reported tornado prompted a statewide response in New York late Tuesday, as rain, hail, and heat threatened millions of residents along the East Coast a day after severe weather in the Midwest left one person dead.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches were in effect Tuesday night across several states, including New Jersey, New York, Delaware, and Maryland as the National Weather Service warned of dangerous winds, hail, and tornadoes. Parts of Northern Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma were also under thunderstorm watches.\n\nThe heavy rain Monday left parts of the Midwest at risk of flash flooding. A stretch of Missouri and Illinois was placed under a flash flood warning, hours after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood threat in southern-central Indiana into early Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the weather service, east-central Missouri was also hit with a tornado warning just after noon on Tuesday after radar detected a tornado moving at 15 mph. As of late Tuesday, more than 166,000 customers remained without power across Illinois and Indiana, according to a USA TODAY outage tracker.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency Tuesday as thunderstorms ripped through the state, knocking out power to more than 175,000 customers. The New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was also assembling crews to assist with storm cleanup in Oneida County, where a tornado reportedly touched down and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\nSevere weather on Tuesday comes after a \"complex of destructive storms\" moved across eastern Iowa into northern Illinois on Monday night, according to the weather Service office in Chicago. Multiple tornadoes were reported along the line of storms as it moved through the Chicago metro, the agency said, adding its staff had to briefly seek shelter from a tornado.\n\nThe weather service confirmed three tornadoes on Monday night. One tornado was confirmed by radar near Sugar Grove, a village about 46 miles west of Chicago, according to the weather service. Another two tornadoes touched down near Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nA 44-year-old woman died in Cedar Lake, an Indiana town around 45 miles south of Chicago, on Monday night after a tree fell on her home amid the severe storms, the Lake County Coroner's Office posted on Facebook.\n\nNo summer relief:U.S. cities with lowest air conditioning rates suffer through blistering heat\n\nFull dam failure in Illinois prevented after residents evacuated\n\nOn Tuesday, officials in Nashville, Illinois, a town about 50 miles east of St. Louis, issued an evacuation order amid the \"imminent failure\" of a local dam, putting the area at risk of flash flooding.\n\nSome residents reported waist-high levels of water inside their houses, according to the Washington County Emergency Management Agency, and one person trapped inside required a rescue. No deaths or injuries were reported as of Tuesday evening, the agency said.\n\nThe \"immediate safety concern\" had passed after there was no additional rain, the agency said Tuesday evening. The Army Corps of Engineers assessed the reservoir and noted that repairs will be required to maintain the integrity of the dam, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency added that the secondary dam reacted and helped prevent a full dam failure. Authorities said residents were allowed to return to evacuated areas but advised people to avoid travel due to flooded roads and decreased visibility.\n\n\"However, there is significant property damage from the flooding,\" the agency said in a statement. \"It could be quite some time before the impacted areas return to normal.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a flash flood warning was issued by the National Weather Service in St. Louis through 10:45 a.m. local time. Forecasters warned that thunderstorms and heavy rain on Tuesday morning could trigger \"life-threatening\" flooding of creeks, streams, highways, streets, urban areas and underpasses.\n\nBy 1 p.m. local time Tuesday, the county's emergency management agency had documented more than 6 inches of rain. Authorities said the local Red Cross was activated and a nearby shelter was established.\n\nNew York governor declares state of emergency\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for the entire state late Tuesday after storms swept across central New York.\n\n“We are deploying assistance for localities as severe weather continues to move across the state,” Hochul wrote on X. “Continue to monitor your local weather forecasts & give first responders room to do their work.”\n\nThe New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services activated the State Emergency Operations Center to track the storm and support local authorities’ requests for assistance.\n\nTornado reportedly hits central New York town\n\nAuthorities in New York are urging residents to stay off the roads after a tornado reportedly touched down Tuesday and wreaked havoc on homes, historic landmarks, and power infrastructure.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation in Mohawk Valley said on social media that it received reports of storm damage from across the region with several damaged buildings and downed power lines.\n\nOneida County Executive Anthony Picente Jr. declared a state of emergency and said the city of Rome was most damaged but noted there were no reports of serious injuries.\n\nHe also warned restoring power to thousands of customers across the county could take several days due to the significant damage. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on X that she was in contact with local officials in Rome and deployed resources from state police and other agencies to support recovery efforts.\n\nRome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan said the weather disaster was unprecedented for the city but urged residents to be positive.\n\n“Romans are resilient. And we’re going to build back,” Lanigan said Tuesday. “Give us the time and space we need right now and let our guys work, and I promise you Rome will come back even better.”\n\nThe catastrophic storm comes just days after seven twisters touched down in the central and western parts of the state. The National Weather Service is expected to determine on Wednesday whether Tuesday's system was a tornado.\n\nOn Tuesday, the weather service office in Buffalo confirmed that a tornado touched down in Canandaigua — a city about 27 miles southeast of Rochester — on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe EF-0 twister had peak wind speeds of 75 mph and was on the ground for two minutes, traveling 0.7 miles, according to the data released Tuesday afternoon. The tornado had a width of 75 yards and damaged trees and some homes.\n\nTwo confirmed tornadoes near Des Moines, Iowa\n\nThe weather service said Tuesday that an EF1 tornado traveled just over 7 miles through Urbandale, Windsor Heights, and Des Moines, as wind gusts reached 105 mph.\n\nThere were no injuries or deaths from the tornado. But the storm left behind damaged trees, homes, and downed power lines, knocking out electricity and internet for 10,000 people at its peak Monday.\n\nAn EF1 tornado also hit the Quad Cities on Monday evening. The tornado started in Davenport and moved east. It passed through Bettendorf and crossed the Mississippi River, making it to East Moline.\n\nWind speeds were as high as 100 mph, and the tornado traveled 8 miles. The max width of the tornado was 100 yards. It resulted in damage to trees, roofs, and cars.\n\nMonday storms caused by rare, destructive derecho\n\nMonday's series of storms was triggered by a derecho, according to Weather.com. Classified as a \"wide-spread, long-lived wind storm\" by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), derechos can come with fast-moving thunderstorms and showers.\n\nThe storms are rare but can cause destruction comparable to a tornado, according to the National Weather Service. Unlike tornadoes, they generally inflict damage in one direction, on a straight-line path.\n\nA storm must sustain winds of 58 mph or greater and leave a path of damage at least 250 miles long to be classified as a derecho, according to the weather service. Many derechos pack wind gusts that blow at more than 100 mph, toppling power lines and trees and wreaking widespread devastation.\n\nMeteorologists only see around one derecho every one to four years. They usually strike the eastern two-thirds of the country, and 70% happen from May to August, the weather service said.\n\nIntense heat wave threatens East Coast\n\nMeanwhile, scorching heat continued for the third week this month as more than 126 million people remained under heat alerts across the country on Tuesday, according to heat.gov. The Weather Prediction Center said scorching temperatures are expected to continue to grip the East Coast, with major to extreme heat risk possible.\n\nIn Baltimore and Washington, D.C., the weather service warned of a \"dangerously hot and humid\" day; temperatures were expected to reach 102 degrees.\n\nThe weekslong heat wave has already set dozens of records and will challenge more through the week, AccuWeather said.\n\nHurricane Beryl:Beryl produced so many tornado warnings it broke a record\n\nCold front brings heat relief, storm risk this week\n\nA strong cold front pushing across the central to eastern U.S. this week will bring an end to a wave of record-high temperatures in the region, the National Weather Service said Tuesday, though strong summer heat will continue to pose health risks.\n\n\"While record highs may be diminishing on Wednesday, the combination of another day of heat and high humidities will continue to produce life-threatening conditions,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe cold front could also fuel widespread thunderstorms across the central and eastern U.S., the weather service said, which could cause flash flooding in some towns. The rain will be welcome in large swaths of the region where an unusually dry summer so far has spurred moderate to severe drought conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, the weather service said no relief is in sight for an unusually hot season in the West, where temperatures are expected to reach 5 to 15 degrees above average and little rainfall is expected.\n\n\"Given the dry conditions, hot temps and low relative humidities, fire risks will continue across large portions of the West over the next few days,\" the weather service wrote.\n\nOregon thunderstorms could fan wildfire flames\n\nAt least four wildfires blazed in Oregon on Tuesday as the governor declared a state of emergency ahead of thunderstorms expected in the Portland area into the evening.\n\n\"I urge all Oregonians to take extreme precautions, particularly with lightning in the forecast for this weekend,\" Gov. Tina Kotek wrote in a statement. \"It is incumbent on all of us to keep Oregon green and protect our communities.”\n\nKotek invoked the declaration specifically in response to the Cow Valley Fire, which had blazed through more than 133,400 acres and was only 16% contained, as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Portland also issued a fire weather watch throughout the Willamette National Forest, around 80 miles south of Portland.\n\nForecasters warned that lightning from thunderstorms expected to move over the area on Tuesday night could start fires in the dry environment. Winds from the storm could also spread the flames, the weather service said.\n\nMeanwhile, fires in Arizona had consumed more than 56,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nThe largest, the Freeman Fire, was three-quarters contained on Tuesday after it blazed through more than 32,500 acres.\n\nThe fire was sparked by a lightning strike last Thursday near Oracle, around 30 miles northwest of Tucson, and grew after it merged with another fire sparked by lightning, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. Evacuation orders for nearby areas were lifted on Sunday.\n\nSnow in Philly in July?\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey issued a daily record report Monday morning saying a “trace” of snow at Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday set a new daily record.\n\nThe \"snow\" was really hail that fell in thunderstorms over the airport, the office stated in a post on X with a #TeamSnow hashtag. The \"trace\" of snow broke a record of 0.0 inches, set in 1870, the weather service office shared X. By Tuesday afternoon, the post had been viewed more than 166,000 times.\n\nUnder a policy of the National Centers for Environmental Information, hail is considered frozen precipitation under the same umbrella as snow, sleet, and graupel, the office stated in a response to its original post.\n\n3 suspected heat-related deaths at Utah parks\n\nEarlier Monday, the San Juan County Sheriff's Office in southeast Utah confirmed that a man and his daughter died late last week after they ran out of water during a hike.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it was notified at 5:45 p.m. on July 12 of a deceased hiker in the Canyonlands National Park. About 15 minutes later, a second deceased hiker was reported in the same area.\n\nThe National Park Service reported that the pair of hikers were a father and daughter \"who had become lost while hiking, according to the sheriff's office. The air temperature at the time of the incident was over 100 degrees, the National Park Service said.\n\n\"Dispatch informed NPS of emergency 911 texts from the hikers, reporting that they were lost and out of water,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement.\n\nThe father and daughter were identified as Albino Herrera Espinoza, 52, and Beatriz Herrera, 23, both from Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nOn Saturday, the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department in southwest Utah said first responders were dispatched to the Snow Canyon State Park, where preliminary information showed two individuals \"suffering from a heat-related incident.\" The two individuals had signs of heat exhaustion and were transported to a hospital.\n\n\"While on the scene, a passerby contacted police and reported that a third individual was unconscious a short distance away,\" the department said in a news release. \"The individual was identified as a 30-year-old female.\"\n\nFirst responders determined that the woman was deceased, according to the department. Her death is being investigated by the department.\n\nDozens of heat-related deaths have been reported by state officials and local media this month. Although the death toll is expected to increase as the summer continues, experts previously told USA TODAY that the true death toll is likely higher.\n\nIllinois man dies after truck sinks in floodwaters\n\nOfficials in Rockford, Illinois, are investigating the death of a 76-year-old man who was trapped as floodwaters swept away a pickup on Sunday, the Rockford Register Star, part of the USAT TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe man was riding in the passenger seat of a Dodge Dakota truck as the woman driving tried to leave a parking lot inundated with flood water, according to the Winnebago County Coroner's Office.\n\nWhen the truck was pulled into a nearby creek, the driver escaped through a window and was rescued, officials said. The man was trapped in the truck as it sank below the water. Local law enforcement tried to pull him out, but could not rescue him.\n\nThe truck was pulled from the creek and the man was pronounced dead around three hours later.\n\nAuthorities have not named either the man who died or the woman who was rescued.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Kealey, Des Moines Register; Casey Pritchard, Utica Observer Dispatch; Victoria E.

That rate is only expected once in 100 years, on average. Dallas also got over 3 inches of rain in just one hour overnight – a roughly a 1-in-50-year rainfall rate, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates.\n\nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared a state of disaster in the county in response to the flood damage and is requesting state and federal assistance, according to a tweet he posted to his official account.\n\nAn unidentified 60-year-old woman was killed by the flooding in Dallas County when her vehicle was swept away by the water, Jenkins said.\n\nHer car was “presumably” swept off the road and was discovered as the water receded, according to Mesquite Fire Department Chief Russell Wilson.\n\n“I’ve never experienced anything like this in my entire life,” said Brittany Taylor, who moved to her Dallas apartment just two days before Monday morning’s flooding left most of her belongings ruined by the flood.\n\nTaylor woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of the torrential rain and couldn’t fall back asleep owing to the sound of leaking, she told CNN.\n\n“All the cardboard boxes started collapsing, so a lot of my belongings started crashing into the water. I lost a lot of my stuff,” she said, adding her renter’s insurance doesn’t cover flood losses.\n\nFast-rising water trapped vehicles around 3 a.m. on Interstate 30 in Dallas, said Cassondra Anna Mae Stewart, who took video of the dark, watery scene.\n\n“I was able to back up on a ramp to get off the highway,” she said. “I took an alternate route home … although most streets are flooded down there as well.”\n\nAround that time, “trained weather spotters reported major flash flooding ongoing across Dallas with numerous roads and cars submerged, including Interstate 30 at Interstate 45 near downtown Dallas,” according to a flash flood warning statement issued at 3:21 a.m.\n\nMon Lun pulls a strap to his water stalled car Monday before towing it out of receding flood waters in Dallas. LM Otero/AP\n\nThe influx of storm water caused the Dallas sanitary sewer system to overflow in several locations, the Dallas Water Utilities Department said in a news release. The water supply is not damaged, the city said, and crews are performing cleanups at each overflow location.\n\n“Although there is no danger to the water supply, the public is reminded to avoid contact with waste material, soil or water in any of the affected areas,” the city said, adding that people in impacted areas who are using private drinking water supplies should only use boiled or distilled water.\n\nOther major cities in Monday’s flood watch zone include Austin, Texas, and Shreveport, Louisiana. The region is under a moderate – Level 3 of 4 – risk of excessive rainfall. Rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour have been observed as storms move slowly across the area, creating the potential for up to 3 to 5 inches of rainfall.\n\nThe soaking weather pattern is expected to continue spreading active showers an thunderstorms across eastern Texas and into the Lower Mississippi over the next few days, which may result in more flash flooding, according to the NWS.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nA sign of ‘climate whiplash’\n\nThe Dallas-area deluge comes in concert with a “flash drought” that has developed over this extremely dry year across Texas. Exceptional drought – the highest designation – is present over Dallas and Tarrant counties and blankets more than a quarter of the state.\n\n“Over the last half-year, rainfall deficits of 8 inches to locally over a foot have affected areas of central Texas near and south of Dallas/Ft. Worth to the Gulf Coast,” the Drought Monitor summary said Thursday.\n\nBut those rainfall deficits will be essentially erased after Monday in Dallas, though large deficits will still remain for other areas of Texas.\n\nHuman-caused climate change has increased the potential for this sort of weather whiplash, in which dramatic swings in periods of drought and high precipitation can occur more often.\n\nA larger share of precipitation in recent years has come during “intense single-day events,” and the likelihood of sudden shifts from severe drought to heavy rain will become more common on a warming planet, scientists say. Indeed, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1996.\n\nRainfall over land has become more frequent and more intense with every degree of warming since the 1980s. It’s because warmer air can hold more water, causing storms like Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017, to not only produce storm surges and damaging winds but also cause more intense inland deluges.\n\nMonday’s rainfall has pushed this month to the third-wettest August on record for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with more than 7 inches in all so far – the most rainfall seen in the month since 1915.\n\nAhead of the Texas flooding, rain persisted Sunday in parts of Arizona and New Mexico following floods in prior days in parts of the Southwest.\n\nMotorists escape flooded vehicles early Monday in downtown Dallas.

For the latest news on the storm please see our live updates file for Monday, Feb. 5.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO − A fierce winter storm fueled by a raging atmospheric river was thrashing Californians on Sunday with intense downpours, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, flooding roadways and prompting a rare warning of hurricane-force winds.\n\nUp to 37 million people, about 94% of the state's population, were at risk for life-threatening floods from the storm, Accuweather meteorologists warned. The atmospheric river − like a river in the sky − is the second to pound the state in recent days, but forecasters said this storm would be the season's most potent, particularly in Southern California.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare hurricane-force wind warning for the Central Coast: Wind gusts up to 92 mph were possible from the Monterey Peninsula to the northern section of San Luis Obispo County.\n\nSan Francisco officials sent out alerts about flooded and blocked streets, fallen trees − including a large one that brought down power lines − and a hillside landslide. About 100 miles down the coast in Monterey County, the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament was postponed until Monday, when weather conditions don't look favorable either.\n\nThe storm was expected to head south and hit the Los Angeles area with downpours, flash floods, and high-elevation mountain snow Sunday afternoon into the evening, then to pound Orange County and San Diego on Monday and Tuesday. Los Angeles and Orange were among eight Southern California counties were Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.\n\n\"All systems are go for one of the most dramatic weather days in recent memory,\" the National Weather Service said Sunday.\n\nThe first storm in the \"Pineapple Express\" soaked the state with 1-6 inches of rain Wednesday and Thursday. The new storm is laden with even more moisture, forecasters said, setting up dangerous and deadly conditions in already-saturated regions.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n∎ Winds exceeded 60 mph in some parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, with gusts above 80 mph in the mountains, strong enough to qualify for a Category 1 hurricane. Some areas received wind gust speeds of 98 mph and 102 mph.\n\n∎ More than 856,00 homes and businesses were without power in California by 9:00 p.m. PST, the majority of them concentrated in coastal regions, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n∎ Firefighters rescued a man stranded on an island in the Ventura River Sunday. The man was trapped with water rising around him, said Jeremy Henderson, a battalion chief with the Ventura City Fire Department. Someone reportedly heard the man screaming for help and called 911.\n\nLocal leaders warn residents to evacuate amid flood, mudslide risks\n\nEvacuation warnings and orders were in effect for Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Monterey counties.\n\nClasses were canceled Monday for schools across Santa Barbara County. The Santa Barbara Airport closed Sunday evening due to flooding on the airfield, it said on its website.\n\n“This storm is predicted to be one of the largest and most significant in our county’s history and our goal is to get through it without any fatalities or any serious injuries,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to follow orders and evacuate ahead of possible mudslides.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing. The county set up shelters where evacuees could spend the night.\n\nIn San Diego, Mayor Todd Gloria said during a news conference Sunday that the storm \"has the potential to drop a significant and unusual amount of rainfall on San Diego.\" He added that the city could receive between 2 to 2.5 inches of rain from Sunday night to Tuesday, with some areas possibly getting half an inch of rain per hour.\n\nGloria noted that the storm would be the city's third rain event in two weeks and reissued an evacuation order for low-lying and flood-prone areas within the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Orange County issued an evacuation warning for Silverado Canyon, Williams Canyon and Trabuco Canyons due to heavy rains, and encouraged residents in the area to evacuate, especially those with disabilities, access or functional needs, and with large animals.\n\nDesert communities on high alert\n\nWhile the heaviest rains in the low and high California desert are expected late Monday through Tuesday, the surrounding mountains will be hit earlier, with heavy rain likely beginning Sunday night, and heavy snows expected Monday night.\n\nAbout a quarter- to a half-inch of rain is expected in the western part of the Coachella Valley on Monday and a total of 1 to 1.5 inches through Tuesday. The east valley is forecast to get three-quarters of an inch of rain.\n\nMount San Jacinto is expected to receive up to 3 feet of snow and San Gorgonio a little more. Chances of rain lessen across the Coachella Valley by Wednesday but intermittent showers could occur through the end of the week.\n\nSouthern California schools brace for severe weather\n\nThe weather service forecast up to 8 inches of rainfall across Southern California’s coastal and valley areas, with 14 inches possible in the foothills and mountains.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued for the majority of Los Angeles County, including downtown and where the Grammy Awards are being held along with the east area, according to the weather service in Los Angeles. The alerts are in effect until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said up to 1 inch of rain had fallen. \"Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\" the weather service added.\n\nIn response to the dangerous conditions, some schools said Sunday that instruction would move to online classes.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of students, faculty and staff as its top priority, Cal State Fullerton will pivot to remote classes on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024. Staff are encouraged to work remotely,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia State University Long Beach also said campus operations would be modified due to the severe weather, adding that \"in-person classes may shift to online instruction or alternative assignments, where possible.\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it was planning to open schools as usual Monday. The decision would be reevaluated at 6 a.m. Monday, said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.\n\nTorrential rain could lead to flooding and mudslides\n\nHeavy rain was expected from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast through Southern California on Sunday into Monday, the NOAA Weather Prediction Center said. Rainfall of 2-5 inches and up to 6-10 inches in some spots was likely, the prediction center said. “This will result in considerable flash, urban and small stream flooding with debris flows and mudslides,” the prediction center said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday that heavy rain would be moving into the area: 3-6 inches was expected for the coasts and valleys and up to 6-12 inches in the mountains.\n\n“Due to the numerous mountains and hills, even just a few inches of rain can cause significant flooding,” AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said. “The greatest risk … is expected across the canyons and hills of Southern California, especially in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles counties.”\n\nStorm's slow pace makes it more damaging\n\nBy lingering over large parts of California, the storm was drenching terrain that was already saturated from the atmospheric river-driven system that hit much of the state Wednesday and Thursday, increasing the chances of flooding.\n\n“The core of the low pressure system is very deep, and it’s moving very slowly and it’s very close to us,'' said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles-area office. \"And that’s why we have those very strong winds. And the slow nature of it is really giving us the highest rainfall totals and the flooding risk.”\n\nHeavy rain is expected in Southern California through Tuesday and there's a chance for showers through Friday, making mudslides and debris flows likely, forecasters say.\n\n“Even if the rain does start to let up on Monday morning, just the sheer amount of rain overnight will cause lingering flooding issues into the morning hours,” Kittell said.\n\nThree children ‘in the eye of the storm’ 400-plus miles away\n\nDoug and Pam Barry were among more than 100,000 Californians without power when an outage hit their Miraloma Park neighborhood in San Francisco on Sunday morning.\n\nThat was far from their biggest concern, though. Their two sons are attending college in Los Angeles and San Diego, respectively, and their daughter Jessica was visiting the youngest son in San Diego when the storm hit. Now she’s hoping her plans to return Sunday to her home in Scottsdale, Arizona, don’t get disrupted.\n\n“We have all three children in the eye of the storm in Southern California,” Doug Barry said. “We texted them yesterday to be careful with the approaching storm. We will get a good storm, but they will have it worse. Rarely do we share the same weather concerns with our children in California who are 400-plus miles away.”\n\nWill harsh weather keep stars from arriving at Grammys?\n\nThose sporting stylish outfits and elaborate hairdos at the Grammy Awards need not fear the wet and windy weather Sunday in Los Angeles, despite the downpour of biblical proportions expected early in the evening.\n\nThe infamous L.A. traffic? That may be another story.\n\nThe traditional red-carpet walk is being held under a roof and tarp outside the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown L.A., where nearly 5 inches of rain are forecast through Tuesday. The National Weather Service's L.A. office is warning of a \"DANGEROUS SYSTEM with major risks to life and property. Substantial flooding.''\n\nThat's bound to make traffic even more of a nightmare than usual, even for the stars. Last year, headliners such as Beyonce and Bad Bunny arrived late after getting caught in traffic, and it wasn't raining.\n\nThough the heaviest rainfall is not expected until 6 p.m. local time, an hour after the Grammys begin, the forecast calls for moderate rain from noon on, in addition to 30-50 mph winds in Los Angeles County.\n\nHeavy snow, powerful winds could lead to whiteout conditions\n\nHeavy, wet snow was expected to spread across the Sierra Nevada on Sunday through Tuesday morning, with snowfall of 2-3 inches per hour, the prediction center said. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph could lead to whiteout conditions in the Southern California mountains, forecasters said.\n\nPalisades Tahoe, a ski resort about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco, said it was anticipating the heaviest snowfall yet this season, with accumulations of 6 inches per hour for a total of up to two feet.\n\nWhat is a Pineapple Express?\n\nA Pineapple Express is the best-known nickname for an atmospheric river, which occurs when the source of the moisture is near Hawaii. When a Pineapple Express hits land in the western U.S. and Canada, it triggers heavy rain and snow. In California, it can lead to several inches of rain in a day.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Cheri Carlson, Ventura County Star; Kate Franco and Christopher Damien Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/29/big-thompson-flood-killed-scores/87524858/", "title": "40 years later: Scores killed in Big Thompson Flood", "text": "Jason Pohl\n\njasonpohl@coloradoan.com\n\nEditor's Note: On July 31, 1976, the skies opened up over the Big Thompson Canyon, setting off the deadliest natural disaster in Colorado history that claimed 144 lives and caused $35 million of damages.

An estimated 3,500 people were camping, fishing and relaxing in the canyon that night.\n\n40 YEAR LATER: Deadly Deluge: 1976 Big Thompson Flood\n\nA thunderstorm parked near Estes Park and turned the sky a daunting black late that afternoon.\n\nSome residents recall fishing in Loveland and looking to the west, curious about the strange storm pattern that didn't jibe with late-summer monsoon flows. Others remember the peculiarity of water filling wheel barrows in a matter of seconds or nature's brilliant light show after the sun set.\n\nEven the 2013 disaster in the same spot paled in comparison both in body count and sheer brutality, largely because people were caught flat-footed some 40 years ago. A foot of rain fell during a few hours in a stretch of land between the tourist hub of Estes Park and the quaint mountain communities of Drake and Glen Haven.\n\nWith nowhere to go, that deluge sped down the rocky hillsides.\n\nIt took everything in its path.\n\n\"I'm stuck. I'm right in the middle of it. I can't get out...\" said Colorado State Patrol Sgt. Willis Hugh Purdy in his last radio transmission before being swept away, killed by the water. He's credited with saving hundreds of lives by issuing evacuations lower in the canyon.\n\nPropane tanks burst. Water buoyed homes. Babies were snatched from their families.\n\nThe river even moved a 275-ton boulder the size of a small house.\n\nAll told, the pressure washer of water that tore through the Big Thompson Canyon caused more than $35 million in damage to 418 homes and businesses — nearly $150 million by 2016 standards. More than 400 vehicles, many loaded with tourists or residents trying outrun the water, were swept off roads and sent crashing down the steep and craggy mountain canyon.\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES: A look back at Coloradoan's coverage of the 1976 flood\n\nBodies were pulled from debris piles and muck from high in the canyon to areas near Interstate 25. It wasn't until the death toll surpassed the 100 people that many realized just how bad this storm had been.\n\nThere were at least 250 reported injuries, and more than 800 people were helicoptered out when day broke and the sun shined the following Sunday morning, Aug. 1. The stories of survival, near death and loss made national headlines. Flood waters were replaced by a flood of people — rescuers, family members and journalists, their own stories making headlines about covering the mayhem in a time before cellphones, the internet and camera ubiquity.\n\n\"For days, it was a race from one stop to the next, then to the nearest phone or back to Fort Collins to make the deadline for the afternoon paper,\" wrote Jake Henshaw, the lead Coloradoan reporter who covered disaster, in a column marking the 10th anniversary. \"...[W]hat strikes me most is not how quickly the flood and the rescue were over but how long the clean-up took and how deeply the scars cut.\"\n\n10 YEARS LATER: Reporter remembers how Big Thompson Flood unfolded\n\nFamilies gathered at the old Loveland Memorial Hospital, anxious to hear the latest identity of the figures tucked in body bags, which were laid out in refrigerated trucks in the parking lot — there were too many for the morgue to handle.

That was a lesson from 1976. Flood plains were re-drawn. Some homes were rebuilt. Many weren't.\n\nEach year, residents, friends, family, and survivors gather at the Big Thompson Canyon Association and Memorial Site, about one mile below Drake, 13 miles west of the Kmart on U.S. Highway 34 in Loveland. Sometimes there's singing. Other times just speeches.

The San Diego school district, which planned to begin its fall term Monday, said it will delay the start of classes to Tuesday.\n\n◾ The city of Palm Springs declared an emergency, \"due to unprecedented rainfall in flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue.\" The declaration, according to spokesperson Amy Blaisdell, opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\n◾ In Southern California, at least two debris flows have been reported over roadways in San Bernardino, and rocks have been reported on roads in three locations in Kern, the National Weather Service said. Two semi-trucks were reported flipped along Interstate 8 in Imperial, the weather service added.\n\n◾ Hilary’s rainfall is an extreme, record-breaking event, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There’s a very clear link between increases in extreme precipitation and global warming,” Swain said. In a warmer world, “the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially.”\n\n◾ California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency, and authorities issued an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, 23 miles off the coast.\n\n◾ As the storm rolls north, portions of Oregon and Idaho could see as much as 3 to 5 inches of rain, producing some \"significant\" flash flooding, the National Weather Service said.\n\n'Walls were moving quite a bit'\n\nLouis Brown, a security guard at Ralph’s grocery store in Marina del Rey, California, surveyed the customers at about 8 p.m. Sunday night. “Last night it was chaos, havoc,’’ Brown told USA TODAY. “It was packed until 1 o’clock, and I could see the fear in their eyes and their soul.’’\n\nHe was referring to the customers stocking up on food before the storm arrived. And less than 24 hours later? “Nothing,’’ he said, looking around the store. “No chaos.’’\n\nWith the initial hurricane having weakened to a tropical storm, Brown presumed those panicked shoppers survived Hilary as did he -- without incident.\n\nRain fell for most of the day, but 17-year-old Michael Gatto said he still rode his skateboard to work at Local Pizza a block from Venice Beach.\n\n“I did it on purpose so I could tell people that,’’ he said.\n\nHe said business was slow but picked up toward the end of the day. One of his last customers of the night was Andrea Iucci, who said he was in town from Amsterdam and visiting with his wife and two children. Originally, Iucci said, they planned to vacation in Maui. But the deadly fires in Hawaii prompted them to head to Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, their third day in Los Angeles, they experienced not only the storm but also the earthquake. He said they were on the top floor of a nearby hotel when the earthquake with a 5.1 magnitude hit.\n\n“The walls were moving quite a bit,’’ he said. “But it’s OK. As long as everyone’s safe.\"\n\nSenior community impacted by flooding in Coachella Valley\n\nAbout 60 homes at the Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City have been impacted by flooding, according to Cathedral City Councilmember Nancy Ross, who also lives in the 55 and older community of 350 homes.\n\n“On the (most impacted streets), there was in several locations at least three feet of rushing water that was like a river and had a current of its own, it’s frightening,” Ross said. “And that rushing water by nature just wanted to follow a straight path up into people’s driveways and into their garages, and so many people flooded.”\n\nRoss says damage to the roughly 60 impacted homes includes water flooded into garages or homes, and water under the mobile homes. Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris.\n\nThe Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park Sunday afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n— Erin Rode, Desert Sun\n\nMudslides and debris flow through mountain and desert areas\n\nBy Sunday evening, Hilary had moved over San Diego and was headed north into inland desert areas.\n\nResidents of the Coachella Valley had previously expressed anxiety and fear over the storm as many spent the past few days preparing by filling up sandbags as a precaution. And as Hilary closed in on the area Sunday night, the heavy rain turned roadways into rivers and filled up the local wash.\n\nCities within the desert region are at risk of dangerous flooding due to their location and environment. Surrounded by several mountain ranges, waterways in the area can be overwhelmed by the heavy rain and can cause waters to quickly rise.\n\n“This entire valley is basically a giant river bottom,” Palm Springs resident Carley Pinkney told the New York Times.\n\nIn an area where residents are accustomed to intense heat and the blaring sun during this time of year, Hilary is bringing record rain. Palm Springs set a daily record for rainfall on Sunday, recording more than two inches as of 5 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Usually, when the weatherman says rain, they’re wrong because we get rain like one and a half days a year,” resident Michael Matera told the Times.\n\n“When it rains, it just sits there, like it’s in a bowl,\" he added.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, AccuWeather storm chaser Aaron Rigsby said a large mudslide moved boulders and trees onto the roadway in Forest Falls. Images and videos of the mud slide showed debris flowing in muddy waters, completely covering roads.\n\nSan Bernardino County declared a local emergency Sunday afternoon and the sheriff's department issued evacuation orders for several communities, including Forest Falls.\n\nSouthern California cities see impacts of Hilary\n\nThe full strength of the tropical storm had yet to reach the city of Diamond Bar in Los Angeles County Sunday evening, but the environment is already seeing some effects.A large tree broke off onto one of the city’s major streets on Sunday afternoon. A police car blocked off the route as it covered one whole side of the street that was near a business center.After spurts of rain were scattered throughout the day, the rain began to pick up in the afternoon, as some streets began to see some flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Diego County, strong winds and moderate rain toppled trees, moved boulders, and flooded roadways. San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency on Sunday as the storm's center closed in on the region.\n\nThe weather service in San Diego issued several flash flood and tornado warnings Sunday afternoon for the eastern part of the county. During a live broadcast, the agency said it was watching \"one of the remnant eyewall bands moving through the county,\" bringing the heaviest rain.\n\n\"This is the type of rain that can cause urban flooding, mud debris, even sometimes flash flooding,\" the agency said. \"... Never before has there been a tropical storm level system intact moving through San Diego County.\"\n\nSeveral roadways were closed or blocked off due to rock slides and rising waters. Crews from the California Department of Transportation were working on Interstate 8 near In-Ko-Pah near the U.S.-Mexico border after boulders had moved into the road.\n\nEarthquake shakes Southern California amid Hilary threat\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 jolted parts of Southern California Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, as residents in the region braced for Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nThe earthquake was centered about four miles southeast of Ojai, California, about 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It struck shortly after 2:40 p.m. local time at a depth of approximately 9 miles, the USGS said.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, several aftershocks with magnitudes up to nearly 4 were recorded in the area, according to the USGS. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunamis were expected.\n\nTo the best understanding of geoscientists, the earthquake is coincidental, and not related to heavy rainfall in the Los Angeles area, Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nCanceled flights, closed amusement parks, rescheduled MLB games\n\nCanceled and delayed flights, closed amusement parks, and rescheduled baseball games are among the early impacts of Hilary's approach to the U.S.\n\nSouthwest has canceled more than 700 flights scheduled for Sunday and nearly 190 flights set for Monday, according to FlightAware, which tracks flight status in real-time. Other major carriers like United, American, Delta, and JetBlue were impacted as well.\n\n\"As California’s largest carrier, we’ve made proactive adjustments to our flight schedule throughout the weekend and have communicated with affected customers,'' Southwest told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nAmusement parks like LEGOLAND California and Knotts Berry Farm closed their doors Sunday, as did the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld in the same city. Disneyland in Anaheim is shutting down early, at 9 p.m. PT.\n\nMajor League Baseball moved up three games scheduled Sunday in Southern California ballparks. Each of the games – Arizona at San Diego, Tampa Bay at the Los Angeles Angels, and Miami at the Los Angeles Dodgers — were turned into split doubleheaders Saturday to avoid issues with the storm.\n\n'Glassy' waves draw surfers to Venice Beach\n\nMore than a dozen surfers and one pelican braved the extraordinary weather conditions at Los Angeles’ famed Venice Beach with distinctly differently goals Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor the surfers, this was the perfect storm to ride out the waves, and they were not going to be deterred by a sign saying swimming was prohibited. After all, they were technically not breaking any rules.\n\nDamien Rho, an 18-year-old lifeguard from Santa Monica, arrived with his surfboard and a good bit of knowledge about the last time a storm like Hilary hit these shores.\n\n“It’s not every day you get a hurricane out here. You gotta get out here. When is the last time, 1939?” Rho said, getting the year exactly right even if Hilary has actually been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nRho said the increasingly large waves were “glassy,’’ a surfer term for smooth water.\n\nTwo other surfers said these were the best conditions they’d seen at Venice in weeks, brushing off safety concerns by saying it was more dangerous to drive the highway to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe pelican seemed unimpressed and eventually flew away. Apparently, the fishing wasn’t nearly as good as the surfing.\n\nDisaster relief funding running low, FEMA head warns\n\nAhead of Tropical Storm Hilary and other weather disasters, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, warned that her agency is running low on cash to respond to the deadly events in the future.\n\n“We do still anticipate that we will have a shortage of funding at our current spending levels by mid-September,” Criswell said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” If needed, Criswell said, FEMA will push back recovery projects into the next fiscal year to ensure there is enough funding for any “immediate lifesaving needs.”\n\nFEMA’s disaster relief funding shortfall is against the backdrop of numerous weather disasters that have resulted in hundreds of lives lost and billions of dollars in damage, including deadly wildfires in the Hawaiian island of Maui that have claimed over 100 lives alone.\n\nHomeless vulnerable as Hilary advances\n\nVolunteers have been driving the streets of Los Angeles passing out tarps and plastic bags to people without homes so they can try and keep themselves and their belongings dry. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department warned those without a place to stay to move away from riverbeds and other likely flooding locations.\n\nIn Venice Beach, west of downtown Los Angeles, Bobby Geivet arrived at about 6:30 a.m. with a cooler, weathered guitar, a tarp and a plan. Geivet, 45, said he’s homeless but not defenseless against the storm. He tied his tarp between two palm trees and anchored it by using a stone to pound makeshift stakes into the ground. He said he planned to set up a hammock underneath the tarp.\n\n“I like to be high and dry,\" he said. “It’s going to be wet, but I want to be as dry as I can.\"\n\nJoshua Tree National Park closed because of flooding concerns\n\nCoachella Valley could see year's worth of rain over a few days\n\nTropical Storm Emily takes shape but may not last long\n\nWhat began as a large area of low pressure off the Cabo Verde Islands has become well-defined enough to earn a name and designation.\n\nTropical Storm Emily, with maximum sustained winds of almost 50 mph, was heading west-northwest in the Atlantic Ocean at nearly 10 mph Sunday. However, Emily is expected to weaken and lose its status as a tropical storm in the coming days.\n\nContributing: Eve Chen, Ken Tran, Claire Thornton, and Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Franco, Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/21/hilary-hurricane-live-updates-flooding-califfornia/70639206007/", "title": "Hilary live updates: Remnants of hurricane bring dangerous flooding", "text": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. − The remnants of Hurricane Hilary lashed a swath of the West from the mountains and deserts to the Pacific Ocean beaches Monday after triggering mudslides, flooding and water rescues across Southern California.\n\nRain and debris washed out roadways and left vehicles stranded in standing water. Parts of Los Angeles County had almost 7 inches of rain; Beverly Hills had almost 5 inches by early Monday. Downtown Los Angeles saw its wettest August day ever on Sunday when 2.48 inches fell.\n\nMore than 100 miles to the east in Riverside County, a foot of rain fell on Mount San Jacinto. The nearby Coachella Valley was hit hard, and Palm Springs police at one point Sunday said 911 lines were down so residents had to text 911 or reach out to the nearest police or fire station. Crews in Rancho Mirage pumped floodwaters out of the Eisenhower Medical Center. Officials in Palm Desert urged residents to stay home or proceed with caution while workers cleaned up downed trees and mitigated flooding.\n\n“This storm has been unlike anything our community has faced before,\" authorities said in a Facebook post. \"Not everything is a quick fix, but our team is doing our best to have Palm Desert up and running.\"\n\nSchools, businesses and offices closed across the region as the storm remained capable of \"life-threatening and locally catastrophic flooding\" for parts of the Southwest, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami downgraded Hilary to a post-tropical storm but warned the system could produce another 2 to 4 inches of rain in many areas. Isolated communities across portions of Southern California and southern Nevada could see up to 12 inches through Monday, forecasters said.\n\nAs the storm rolled north, parts of Oregon and Idaho were already experiencing heavy rain Monday. Some areas could get hit with up to 5 inches through Tuesday morning, resulting in some \"significant\" flash flooding, the weather service said. But Southern California was not free of Hilary.\n\n\"Across interior Southern California, road and rail line closures due to major flooding, washouts and mudslides are likely, putting a significant strain on infrastructure,\" said Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather director of forecasting operations.\n\nTropical Storm Hilary updates:Storm drenches Southern California, prompting floods, rescues\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ In San Diego, rescue teams pulled 13 people from knee-deep water in a homeless encampment along the rising San Diego River. Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency ahead of the 1.82 inches of rain the city received Sunday − the most of any August day on record.\n\n∎ Images of a flooded Dodger Stadium parking lot became a trending topic on social media Sunday, but by the next morning the area had dried out, according to a Dodgers tweet.\n\n∎ Preliminary 36-hour rainfall from southern Nevada shows that Bristlecone, west of Las Vegas, was inundated with 6 inches, breaking the rainfall record for a tropical cyclone or remnant for the state.\n\n∎ South-central Arizona could see strong, severe thunderstorms Monday, the weather service said.\n\nHilary tracker:Hilary tracker: Follow storm's path as post-tropical cyclone moves into Nevada\n\nSeniors rescued with earthmover in desert community\n\nIn Cathedral City, a desert community of about 50,000 just east of Palm Springs, 14 seniors were pulled from a home care facility with the help of earthmovers on Monday.\n\nThey were among the 46 people who were rescued in the city after a mudflow that developed Sunday night trapped several people in cars, homes, and even a train. After Hilary had dropped over 3 inches of rain across the Coachella Valley, low-lying desert roads and some homes were damaged by flooding in addition to being submerged in mud.\n\nEarthmovers were used to rescue the 14 seniors when the homes in the area became inundated with mud. They were transferred to other care facilities after the dramatic rescue.\n\n“It’s not something I have ever done in my 34 years as a firefighter,” Cathedral City Fire Chief Michael Contreras said of the rescue. “But disasters like this really cause us to have to really look at those means of rescue that aren’t in a book and that you don’t use every day.”\n\nHilary leaves behind thick layers of mud\n\nAbundant amounts of mud where it doesn't belong were one of the most noteworthy effects of Hilary's journey through Southern California, causing traffic backups from layers of sludge thick enough to get SUVs stuck.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, crews were working Monday to clear mud that has been blocking the homes of about 800 residents, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Alison Hesterly said. Among them was a couple in the town of Oak Glen whose house was surrounded by about 4 feet of muck.\n\nIn Cathedral City, Kimberly Garnica woke up to find her car was stuck in mud outside her home.\n\n“The yard is just filled with a lot of mud,” said Garnica, 20. “You can just tell the streets aren’t really built for this.”\n\nEmergency incidents doubled in Los Angeles\n\nIn Los Angeles, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said Monday her department had dealt with more than 1,800 emergency incidents over a 24-hour period, more than double the average number. Rescuers remained vigilant for mudslides that could be triggered on sodden mountainsides, she said.\n\nMayor Karen Bass said there were no reports of deaths or injuries and that damage appeared to be relatively minor. Crews were out cleaning up debris and returning power in areas that went dark. Most city workers were working remotely Monday but were expected to return to offices Tuesday, she said.\n\nUCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain noted this was a \"historic event'' in the region given how many rainfall records were broken.\n\n\"I'm glad it wasn't more widespread,'' Swain said, \"but I don think it was quite severe in some isolated areas.''\n\nNew system could become a tropical storm and threaten Texas\n\nWhile the remnants of Hilary continue to soak the western U.S., several tropical systems were bubbling up in the Atlantic. The one system that will threaten the mainland U.S. has yet to become a tropical depression or storm. What’s called “Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine,” now spinning in the Gulf of Mexico, is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm before slamming by midday Tuesday into south Texas, where a tropical storm warning was in effect.\n\nThe system, which will be dubbed Harold if it reaches tropical storm strength as expected, will bring heavy rainfall and possibly flooding across south Texas on Tuesday and into Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. When the center released its latest update at 4 p.m. Central Time on Monday, the system was about 375 miles southeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, and carried sustained winds of up to 35 mph. The update included flood watches or warnings for parts of seven western states.\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic Basin, Tropical Storm Franklin was forecast to hit the island of Hispaniola − shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti − later Tuesday and into Wednesday.\n\n“Across Hispaniola, significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding is possible Tuesday into Wednesday,” the hurricane center said.\n\nThe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was also forecast to feel the effects of Franklin, mainly in the form of heavy rain and flash flooding. Franklin is expected to produce rainfall amounts of up to 6 inches across Puerto Rico through the middle of the week.\n\nMeanwhile, far out in the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Emily dissipated into a remnant low Monday morning, while Tropical Storm Gert was likely to dissipate “at any time,” the hurricane center predicted.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nPalm Springs could get a year's worth of rain in 2 days\n\nPalm Springs had been deluged by more than 3 inches of rain by Monday morning. Almost an inch fell in one hour Sunday afternoon in a city that typically picks up less than half an inch all summer, AccuWeather said. Palm Springs averages less than 6 inches of rain a year and could get that in 48 hours, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe city declared an emergency \"due to unprecedented rainfall and flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue.\" A 20-mile section of I-10 was closed in both directions because of storm damage.\n\nSome residents dealt with earthquake during storm\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 jolted parts of Southern California on Sunday in the midst of the storm, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake, which struck at 2:40 p.m. local time, was centered about 4 miles southeast of Ojai. The Ventura County Sheriff's Office said no significant injuries or damage were immediately reported.\n\nThere is no apparent cause and effect between storms and earthquakes, the U.S. Geological Survey says on its website.\n\nLake Mead closed since Friday\n\nThe Lake Meade National Recreation Area remained closed Monday \"for the purposes of maintaining public health and safety\" after being damaged by Hilary. The lake, the nation's largest artificial reservoir, is on the Colorado River in Nevada and Arizona, about 25 miles from the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe Park Service said the recreation area had experienced multiple power and utility outages and dock damage that makes access difficult for emergency response boats. Multiple park areas rely on one-road access with low water crossings that probably will be be washed out, disconnecting entire communities from service and rescue, the Park Service said.\n\nSaddled by years of drought, increasing demands for water and climate change, the lake level reached historic lows last year, and the remains of several bodies were found. Last week, however, the Bureau of Reclamation said investments in system conservation and improved hydrology have led to \"significant improvements.\"\n\nHilary in photos:Hilary in photos: See flooding, damage in Southern California after storm moves through\n\nContributing: Eve Chen, Ken Tran, Claire Thornton, Jordan Mendoza, Josh Peter and Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Franco, Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/12/vermont-flooding-updates-northeast-braces-more-storms/70404895007/", "title": "Vermont flooding updates: Battered Northeast braces for more storms", "text": "MONTPELIER, Vt. − Vermont residents across the state are toiling Wednesday amid a monumental cleanup after historic rains fueled devastating floods that washed away roads, trails, crops and homes, littering streets and businesses with debris.\n\nUrban search and swift water rescue teams have performed more than 200 rescues and 100-plus evacuations since Sunday, state Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said, and new flash flood warnings have been issued because more rain is in the forecast.\n\n“Vermonters, keep your guard up and do not take chances,” Morrison said.\n\nThe disaster brought out the civic spirit in Montpelier, where so many of the capital city's 8,000 residents offered to help shoveling mud, cleaning and moving damaged items outside that volunteer organizer Peter Walke said some had to be turned away.\n\nGov. Phil Scott toured the affected areas with Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose teams began aerial and on-the-ground damage assessments a day after President Joe Biden declared an emergency and authorized federal disaster relief.\n\n\"The damage in Vermont is devastating, and our people will need support,'' Scott tweeted, expressing gratitude for FEMA's presence.\n\nSmall victories were emerging Wednesday after two days of storms dumped up to 9 inches of rain in some areas. The Winooski and North Branch rivers, where flooding had water rushing through streets of Montpelier like tributaries, were receding below flood stage, and city officials said water at the Wrightsville Dam was not expected to breach the spillway.\n\nTuesday, City Manager William Fraser warned that the spillway threatened to release water into the North Branch River. \"This has never happened since the dam was built, so there is no precedent for potential damage,\" Fraser said.\n\n'Still in tears':'Still in tears': Residents devastated as Vermont deluged with record rain, flooding: Live updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎Fraser said the city was shifting to a recovery mode as public works employees removed mud and debris from downtown streets, where floodwaters had reached the tops of parking meters.\n\n∎The Winooski River through Montpelier had dropped from its high of more than 21 feet early Tuesday to about 11½ feet by noon Wednesday, still well above its normal level of about 7 feet, according to sensors.\n\n∎ Montpelier was among a dozen Vermont towns and communities under a boil-water alert because of the floods.\n\n∎Scott said floodwaters surpassed levels seen during Tropical Storm Irene 12 years ago. Irene killed at least six people, washed homes off foundations and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway. No injuries or deaths related to this year's flooding have been reported in Vermont.\n\nA visual guideA visual guide to the flooding in Vermont caused by 'catastrophic' rainfall\n\nMore storms take aim at Northeast\n\nA break in the pattern of storms that dumped two months' volume of rain on Vermont in two days will be a short one, forecasters warn. An \"atmospheric traffic jam\" will pound the Northeast with rounds of rain and locally severe thunderstorms late this week to early next week, AccuWeather said. At least three rounds of downpours and thunderstorms were expected to progress slowly from the central Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic coast and New England, AccuWeather said. The first is expected Thursday to Friday, followed by a second Saturday to Sunday. Another round could come Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIn Montpelier, rain is in the forecast for each of the next seven days. Although the rains are not forecast to be as heavy, the ground is soaked and many low-lying areas remain filled with water, which raises the risk of more flooding.\n\n\"Disturbances from the Midwest will tend to slow down and pivot northward rather than progress quickly out to sea upon reaching the Atlantic coast,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dave Dombek said. \"This action will cause much more rain to be unloaded on some areas as opposed to a storm system that continues to move right along.\"\n\nLudlow among small towns that took severe hit\n\nThe sun was out Tuesday and more sunshine was expected Wednesday. But in Ludlow, a village of fewer than 2,000 people 100 miles south of Montpelier, the primary supermarket remained closed and the water treatment plant was damaged. The baseball and skate parks were destroyed and scores of businesses damaged.\n\nLudlow Municipal Manager Brendan McNamara said he talked with residents who lost their homes.\n\n“We sustained catastrophic damage. We just really took the brunt of the storm,” he said, but, “Ludlow will be fine. People are coming together and taking care of each other. We’ve been here before, and we will get through it.”\n\nFlooding cleanup underway in Montpelier\n\nJesse Gilsinger, who rode out the flooding in his third-floor apartment, used a snow shovel and a brush to push water from the building's lobby on State Street.\n\nGilsinger, 52, a custodian at the nearby State Capitol, said he was eager to get the cleanup started. He said the water was knee-high in the lobby during the worst of the flooding but dropped dramatically by Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Now I guess I'm going to help lead the charge in getting this stuff cleaned up,\" he said.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Anthony Spine, 37, kayaked around the flooded downtown as the waters receded.\n\n\"To have seen it with waist-deep water is so crazy,\" he said. \"I feel bad for all these folks with homes and businesses.

Hilary could produce another 2 to 4 inches of rain in many areas, and isolated areas across portions of Southern California and Southern Nevada could see up to 12 inches through Monday, the weather service said.\n\n\"Across interior Southern California, road and rail line closures due to major flooding, washouts and mudslides are likely, putting a significant strain on infrastructure,\" said Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather director of forecasting operations.\n\nFarewell, Hilary\n\nHurricane-turned-tropical storm Hilary, the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, was on her way out of Ventura County by midnight.\n\n“The majority of the heavy rain has passed Ventura County,” said Rose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. “Although it’s still possible to see some showers still in there.”\n\nVentura County’s flash flood warning was extended from 7:45 p.m. Sunday until 3 a.m. early Monday not because of rain yet to fall, but due to “run-off concerns” with the sheer volume of water already dumped on the county, according to Schoenfeld.\n\n“There was a lot of rain earlier,” Schoenfeld said. “More on the east side of the county.”\n\nWhile much of Ventura and Oxnard received less than an inch of rain, central and eastern parts of the county were soaked.\n\nCal State University Channel Islands (3.68 inches), Moorpark (3.54), Somis (3.18) Thousand Oaks (3.02) and Westlake Village (3.00) received three inches or more of rain, according to NWS rain gauges.\n\nThat was due to a “rain band” that stalled over the eastern part of the county to Point Mugu from late afternoon to early evening, according to Schoenfeld.\n\n“It’s probably going to blow most daily records out of a water,” Schoenfeld said.\n\nAs for wind, gusts were recorded from 30 to 45 miles per hour, mostly at higher elevations. The strongest wind of 53 mph was recorded at Boney Mountain. But its force waned after midday.\n\n“We definitely had some damaging wind,” Schoenfeld. “There were downed power lines and trees… But the winds preceded the rain a little bit.”\n\nAs for the other notable natural event that occurred locally on Sunday, Schoenfeld admitted the 5.1 magnitude earthquake that rattled Ojai, Santa Paula and other parts of Ventura County at 2:41 p.m. was felt at the NWS offices in Oxnard.\n\n“We felt that earthquake in the office,” Schoenfeld said. “It was definitely a lot happening at one time.”\n\nDespite the catchy \"Hurriquake\" label that made its way around social media, Schoenfeld underscored that the two events were not related.\n\n\"Current science shows no relation,\" Schoenfeld said.\n\nFlash flood warning extended until 3 a.m.\n\nThe flash flood warning for Ventura County, including Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, has been extended until 3 a.m. by the National Weather Service.\n\nRose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, said the warning was extended “because of run-off concerns that we’re still seeing.”\n\nA previous warning was set to expire at 7:45 p.m.\n\nSchool (so far) still in session\n\nThere are seven local school districts who have already started classes. All seven, including the Fillmore, Oak Park, Santa Paula and Simi Valley unified school districts, have posted that they will hold classes on Monday.\n\nOxnard Union High School District is still planning to hold classes Monday, according to a 6:45 p.m. social media post.\n\nThe Ventura County Community College campuses and Cal State University Channel Islands will also remain open Monday.\n\nThere were some downed tree limbs at Moorpark College's Teaching Zoo, but the zoo was closed and the animals were safe in their enclosures, per the zoo's Facebook page.\n\nEvacuees cleared to return to Camarillo homes\n\nResidents of the three homes on Trueno Court in Camarillo, who were evacuated earlier Sunday, have been cleared to return home, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nFlood waters threaten two homes at Leisure Village\n\nThe Ventura County Fire Department has received 21 calls for service regarding flooding since 1 p.m. Wood Ranch, Oxnard, Westlake Village, Santa Paula, Fillmore, Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Moorpark and Hollywood-by-the-Sea have been among the communities affected.\n\nJust before 9 p.m., two homes in Leisure Village in Camarillo were under threat of flood waters. Authorities were deciding whether to evacuate residents.\n\nThere is a report of flooding on the Westlake Boulevard on-ramp of Highway 101 North, per CHP Moorpark.\n\nAuthorities respond to report of people trapped\n\nThe Ventura County Fire Department responded to a report of two people in the Santa Clara River yelling for help Sunday night.\n\nThe call came in shortly after 7:30 p.m., authorities said. A swift-water rescue team responded to the spot in the Fillmore area. As of 8:30 p.m., firefighters had rescued two people. A third person was unaccounted for. The search continues.\n\nAt 8:36 p.m., VCFD also responded to a second swift-water rescue call at the Santa Clara River bridge in Saticoy.\n\nRainfall breaks records\n\nLittle rain typically falls this time of year in Southern California. Virtually every place in the region where it rained Sunday likely has broken a record for daily rainfall for August 20, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nIn Oxnard, the 0.77 of an inch of rainfall recorded as of 6:45 p.m. broke the old record of 0.09 of an inch set on Aug. 20, 1983, according to preliminary figures from the agency.\n\nAuthorities issue evacuation order\n\nAuthorities have issued an evacuation order for three homes in the area of Grada and Trueno avenues near Camarillo because of flooding.\n\nThe area has previously flooded during winter storms after an underground storm drain pipe broke. The Ventura County Fire Department responded to the most recent calls around 5:45 p.m. Sunday.\n\nBursts of heavy rain continue\n\nVentura County may have reached the height of the rainfall expected from Tropical Storm Hilary, but moderate to heavy bursts may continue through 8 or 9 p.m. Sunday, forecasters said.\n\nThe center of the tropical storm appeared to be around the Orange County coast as of 6 p.m., said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\n\"It is moving northward,\" he said. \"It should move just east of L.A. County this evening.\"\n\nVentura County was getting a lot of heavy rain over the past hour or so, he said. More than an inch of rain was recorded in some spots in the Camarillo area in just two hours, according to preliminary figures.\n\nThe storm is expected to start tapering off to light to moderate rainfall later Sunday night.\n\nVehicle trapped in floodwaters\n\nAuthorities received a report that a vehicle was trapped in floodwaters at Center School Road and Highway 118 around 6:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe water level apparently had reached the vehicle's doors and someone was still inside, said Chad Cook, deputy chief from the Ventura County Fire Department. A swift-water rescue team was responding, he said.\n\nThe department also had several weather related calls in Camarillo, Santa Rosa Valley and eastern areas of the county over the past few hours. Some had reported minor flooding inside their homes.\n\nReports of flooding near Camarillo\n\nThe Ventura County Fire Department responded to reports of flooding around 5:45 p.m. on Trueno Avenue near Camarillo. Initial reports said several homes were affected and may be temporarily evacuated.\n\nThe spot also had flooding problems earlier this year after an underground drain pipe broke. It was one of several areas county officials sent notifications to residents before the storm.\n\nRoadway flooding in other areas also has been reported.\n\nWarnings issued in Ventura County\n\nHere is a list of the National Weather Service warnings issued in Ventura County as of 5:30 p.m.\n\nFlash flood warning set to expire at 7:45 p.m. for Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Oak Park, Ojai, Oxnard, Piru, Port Hueneme, Point Mugu, Santa Paula, Simi Valley, Somis and Thousand Oaks.\n\nSoutheastern and northern parts of the county are under a tropical storm warning.\n\nRain from Hilary temporarily floods Simi roads\n\nWind gusts clock in at 53 mph\n\nWind gusts exceeded 50 mph Sunday afternoon in the western Santa Monica Mountains.

The warning was set to expire at 7:45 p.m.\n\nCounty releases preliminary rain totals\n\nRainfall totals as of 3 p.m. showed more than 2 inches had been recorded at Lake Piru Sunday. That's according to preliminary figures from the Ventura County Watershed Protection District.\n\nRainfall in others areas included:\n\nCamarillo: 0.07\n\nFillmore: 0.18\n\nLake Piru: 2.13\n\nMatilija Canyon: 0.24\n\nMoorpark: 0.80\n\nOjai: 0.40\n\nPort Hueneme: 0.09\n\nSanta Paula: 0.21\n\nSimi Valley: 0.94\n\nThousand Oaks: 0.37\n\nVentura: 0.22\n\nEarthquake shakes Ventura County\n\nAs residents prepared for wind and rain Sunday afternoon, an earthquake shook the county. The estimated 5.1 magnitude quake struck a few miles southeast of Ojai, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe Ventura County sheriff's Office of Emergency Services said assessments were underway. No immediate issues were reported.\n\nLevels to rise in the Santa Clara River\n\nWater levels may rise in local streams and rivers because of the storm, but the Santa Clara River likely will see some higher flows.\n\nThe amount of rain falling east of the county, including in the Santa Clarita area, likely will mean more water in the river locally – a delayed effect of the storm, officials said.\n\nAuthorities issue flood advisory\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flood advisory for much of Ventura County shortly before 1 p.m. Sunday.\n\nModerate to heavy rainfall was spreading over eastern parts of the county. Flooding on roads and in small streams was expected, particularly in areas that are low lowing or have poor drainage, the agency said. The advisory was set to expire at 8:30 p.m.\n\nModerate to heavy rainfall was expected to spread into western parts of the county later Sunday afternoon.\n\nNWS releases new rainfall totals\n\nThe National Weather Service released the top rainfall amounts over the past 24 hours as of 11 a.m. Sunday.

But they had notified residents in some areas more vulnerable to flooding.\n\nThose include spots hit hard by winter storms such as Camp Chaffee Road north of Ventura, Grada and Trueno avenues in Camarillo, and Matilija Canyon north of Ojai.\n\nHilary moves north\n\nThe track of Tropical Storm Hilary has hugged the coast, but as it moves inland, it will start to lose its source of moisture and weaken, forecasters said. On Sunday morning, Hilary was moving quickly toward the north.\n\n\"It is starting to move up really quickly and weakening as it does,\" said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard.\n\nBy the time, the system reaches Ventura County, it is not expected to be a tropical storm. But a tropical storm warning is still in effect for much of northern and eastern parts of the county. The heaviest rain was expected to reach the county between 3 p.m. and midnight, Wofford said.\n\nRain starts to fall in Ventura County\n\nRain connected with Tropical Storm Hilary has started moving in to Ventura County. By mid-morning Sunday, some rain was falling and gusts were blowing in the foothills around 30 mph.\n\nThe center of the fast-moving storm was still south of the California border, the National Weather Service reported. Meteorologist Joe Sirard said the rain would spread from eastern areas such as Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley to western Ventura County as the day progressed.\n\nHe expected winds of 20 to 30 mph to develop on the coast of Ventura County in the evening with speeds increasing to around 30 mph in the mountains and foothills.\n\nFrom Sunday through Monday morning, forecasters expect 1 to 3 inches across the county. Higher amounts are expected in the mountains. Flooding is still possible if the rain falls in a short amount of time, Sirard said.\n\nNWS releases early rain totals\n\nThe National Weather Service reported the top rainfall amounts over the past 24 hours as of 10 a.m. Sunday. Here were the Ventura County totals:\n\nLockwood Valley: 0.35\n\nChuchupate: 0.16\n\nSycamore Canyon: 0.04\n\nAuthorities warn of dangerous driving conditions\n\nThe National Weather Service warned drivers to expect severe impacts to travel conditions on the Grapevine through Monday.\n\nThe agency posted on social media that dangerous driving conditions are possible on Interstate 5 near the Tejon Pass and other mountain roads. Those could include strong crosswinds, heavy rain, dense fog and mudslides, the agency said.\n\nOfficials cancel air show\n\nSunday's Wings Over Camarillo air show was canceled because of weather concerns as the tropical storm moves toward the area, the Ventura County Department of Airports posted on social media.\n\nAirport officials said the Camarillo Wings Association decided to postpone, until 2024, the second day of the show due to expected conditions related to Hilary.\n\nElsewhere, officials at the Los Padres National Forest and California State Parks urged visitors to check the forecast or delay visits during the storm.\n\nNWS warns of flooding, strong winds in Ventura County\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect for much of Ventura County and all of Los Angeles County.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch in the two counties and warned that potentially dangerous flooding was possible particularly in mountain areas and foothills.\n\nResidents were urged to prepare for hazardous winds that could:\n\nDamage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds and unanchored mobile homes.\n\nBroken tree limbs and some uprooted trees, with fences and roadway signs blown over.\n\nA few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban or heavily wooded places.\n\nHazardous driving conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways.\n\nHilary potentially an 'extraordinary event'\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists warned that Hilary could slam some of the desert areas and mountains in Southern California to southern Nevada with a life-threatening flooding disaster. In San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, the sheriff's office issued evacuation orders for several towns.\n\nDan DePodwin, AccuWeather's director of forecasting operations, said some areas could see more than a year's worth of rain within a day or two.\n\n“The impact from Hilary has the potential to be an extraordinary event, one that is rare and unprecedented,\" he said.\n\nMore:Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve closed\n\nPalm Springs braces for flooding\n\nFarther inland in Riverside California, weather service meteorologist Elizabeth Adams said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour Sunday near Palm Springs across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods, Adams said.\n\nNational Weather Service placed the Coachella Valley under a tropical storm warning, emphasizing the potential for high winds and extreme flooding rain that “may prompt numerous evacuations and rescues.” Palm Springs Fire Chief Paul Alvarado urged residents not to ignore barricades and other warnings on local roads.\n\n\"Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas,” Alvarado said. “We want to avoid swift water rescues, which put the lives of both drivers and public safety at risk.”\n\nHistoric 'heat dome' poised to sweep nation\n\nMeteorologist Ryan Maue said a \"historic, climate-induced heat dome will absolutely demolish records\" in coming days, peaking Thursday when 67 million Americans are forecast to see at least 100°F.\n\n\"Heat domes don't get names or categories yet,\" Maue said on social media. \"But this one would be Category 5.\"\n\nNewsom declares State of Emergency\n\nIn advance of the storm, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday evening to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to begin Saturday and last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nContributing: Kate Franco, Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}]}

In November 2023, the FDA issued a recall of peaches, plums and nectarines sold at stores including at supermarkets including Albertsons, Aldi, Publix, Sam's Club and Walmart over concerns of listeria contamination.\n\nMost people who infected do not become seriously ill, but a serious infection can develop in those most susceptible including pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC . Each year, about 1,600 people get sick and 260 die from listeriosis, the CDC says.\n\nSymptoms may start the same day you eat contaminated food, but are more likely to begin within two weeks after consumption and may start as late as 10 weeks later, according to the FDA.\n\nSymptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea for those with a mild illness. Serious infections may lead to headaches, a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. If you develop symptoms, contact your health care provider.\n\nListeria outbreak cheese recall\n\nThe recently recalled products tie into a multistate and multi-year investigation involving listeria outbreaks connected to Rizo-López Foods in 2021 and 2017, with cases dating back to 2014. The FDA and Centers for Diseased Control and Infection began investigating again after the Hawaii State Department of Health in January 2024 reported it had found a sample of Rizo-López Foods-manufactured Rizo Bros Aged Cotija that tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThe outbreak has resulted in 26 illnesses with 2 deaths and 23 hospitalizations in 11 states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Washington), the CDC has said. Illnesses date back to 2014, the CDC said, with the most recent case in December 2023. One death was reported from California in 2017 and the other death was reported from Texas in 2020, the CDC told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat if I bought cheese products recalled for listeria risk ?\n\nCheck your refrigerator and freezer for any recalled products and throw them away. Do not eat them. If you froze a product without the original packaging and can’t tell if it is part of the recall, throw it away. You can get a refund from the store where you bought the products.\n\nClean and sanitize any surfaces the products may have touched, as listeria can survive in refrigerators and spread to other foods and surfaces. Follow the FDA's safe handling and cleaning advice to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

On April 7, 1933, The Cullen-Harrison Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, went into effect, allowing people to buy and drink low-alcohol content beer and wine in public. Prohibition would be totally repealed in December 1933, when the 21st Amendment was ratified.\n\nOver the subsequent decades, beer in the U.S. grew beyond major breweries such as Anheuser-Busch, Coors and Miller Brewing Co. – and don't forget the country's oldest brewery, Yuengling, which remains a family-owned business.\n\nNational Beer Day 2024:Buffalo Wild Wings, Taco Bell Cantina among spots with deals\n\nThe rise of independent craft breweries grew, thanks in part to President Jimmy Carter's signing in 1978 of a law allowing home brewing of beer. Some of those home brewers went on to create well-known breweries including Boston Beer Co., Brooklyn Brewery, Dogfish Head Brewery, and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.\n\nHere's a look at how beer tastes are changing in the U.S.\n\nModelo still reigns after dethroning Bud Light\n\nModelo Especial remains the best-selling beer in the U.S. and its sales are up 12% so far in 2024, compared to a year ago, according to Bump Williams Consulting. The Shelton, Connecticut firm services the alcoholic beverage industry and uses NIQ data tracking retail sales at supermarkets, convenience and select liquor stores.\n\nModelo Especial overtook Bud Light in May 2023 amidst a backlash from conservative consumers after the Bud Light brand's collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney to promote a contest for March Madness. This year, Bud Light sales are down 28% from a year ago.\n\nThe top-selling beers in the U.S.\n\nModelo Especial\n\nBud Light\n\nMichelob Ultra\n\nCoors Light\n\nCorona Extra\n\nMiller Lite\n\nBudweiser\n\nBusch Light\n\nNatural Light\n\nHeineken Original\n\nSource: NIQ, year-to-date sales for all off-premise outlets, week ending March 23, 2024.\n\nNon-alcoholic beer sales keep climbing\n\nOn this National Beer Day, perhaps more imbibers than ever will pop the top on a non-alcoholic beer. Non-alcoholic beer sales have increased 32.6% so far this year, according to data firm NIQ's tracking of sales.\n\nNon-alcoholic beer sales are even stronger in supermarkets (up 35.5%), where it accounts for 3% of all beer sales, Dave Williams told USA TODAY. Corona, Blue Moon and Guinness are among recent big names to enter the non-alcoholic beer category, he said.\n\nNon-alcoholic beer \"has remained a consistent growth engine within (and for) beer,\" Williams said. \"Not sure we’re quite at the point of saturation as there is still a lot of ground to cover from a market distribution standpoint, but competition is heating up as the 'big boys' all come ready to play.\"\n\nNumber of U.S. breweries approaches 10,000\n\nThe number of breweries in the U.S. has grown from 93 in 1982 to 9,709 in 2022. Most of those (9,552) are regional breweries, microbreweries, taprooms and brewpubs.\n\nIn 2023, 420 new breweries opened, while 385 closed, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nBut slowing demand for beer and increased competition from other products such as ready-to-drink hard seltzers and cocktails could make it hard to hit that 10,000 brewery mark.\n\nThe amount of beer being sold in the U.S. declined 3% in 2022, the most recent year available from the Brewers Association. But price increases drove sales to $115 billion in 2022, up from about $100 billion in 2021, the trade group says.\n\nCraft beer sales increased 5% to $28.4 billion in 2022. Beer made by independent brewers accounted for more than 13%, by volume, of beer sold in the U.S., the association says. But craft beer production likely declined in 2023, the association's chief economist Bart Watson said in a year-end presentation.\n\nThe price of beer at home rose 3% in February 2024 at about the same rate as all items, according to the Labor Department's consumer price index. But beer prices rose higher than that of alcoholic beverages as a whole (2.4%).\n\nTop selling craft beers\n\nBlue Moon Belgian White Ale\n\nNew Belgium Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA\n\nNew Belgium Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA\n\nSierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing\n\nSierra Nevada Pale Ale\n\nShiner Bock\n\nLagunitas IPA\n\nElysian Space Dust IPA\n\nSamuel Adams Seasonal\n\nKona Big Wave Golden Ale\n\nSource: NIQ, year-to-date sales for all off-premise outlets, week ending March 23, 2024.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}]}

It is considered the most important document in sports history. Not only did it start the Yankees on a path of winning 27 World Series titles — including four with Ruth — but it doomed generations of Red Sox players and fans under \"the curse of the Bambino.\" The curse wasn't lifted until 2004, when Boston won its first World Series in 86 years.\n\nThat Ruppert copy was sold privately in 2005 and hasn't changed hands until now. It started with an opening bid of $100,000 and was up to $235,795 as of Friday.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nThere are three copies of the Ruth contract. The Red Sox copy was sold for $996,000 to a Yankees fan during an auction at Sotheby's in 2005. The American League copy has never surfaced.\n\n\"I've always wanted to create an auction where there is the best of the best,\" Lelands.com chairman Josh Evans said. \"This is an auction where you can really focus on each product and go all out. These are items that only come to the market once in a lifetime.\"\n\nMORE:\n\n9 MLB players enjoying breakout offensive seasons in 2017\n\nYankees' Tanaka has something to prove\n\nRuth's ring, which is for the second of four titles he won with the Yankees, could fetch the highest price of all the items. It also started at $100,000 and had a current bid of $313,842.\n\nThat season Ruth had one of the greatest years in baseball history with a .356 batting average, 60 home runs and 156 RBIs. He went 6 for 15 in the World Series sweep against the Pittsburgh Pirates, with two home runs and seven RBIs.\n\nThe auction also features the ball that Pete Rose hit to break Ty Cobb's hit record; Sandy Koufax's rookie jersey with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955; a 1950-51 Joe DiMaggio game-used uniform; a 1957 Willie Mays New York Giants game-worn, signed jersey from his last Polo Grounds game; and a 1939 Lou Gehrig game-used bat.\n\nThe most unique non-baseball item might be the Olympic gold and silver medals won by Chandler Egan in 1904. That was the last time golf was an Olympic sport until it returned for the Rio Games. The medals were recently found in a bookcase in the former home of Egan's daughter in Ohio.\n\n\"A consistent theme from the sale is that there is tremendous crossover historically for a lot of the items. There are multiple reasons why they are great,\" Evans said. \"The Ruth contract changed our country, Koufax is a part of popular culture, and the golf medals are among the greatest golf awards.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/26"}]}

And while all 32 clubs will still be significantly reshaped when the incoming rookies are distributed next month, this is a good time to bust out the report cards to grade how each of them fared at the free agency/trade market, i.e. offseason mid-terms.\n\n(Teams listed alphabetically):\n\nArizona Cardinals: B\n\nThe notable moves were the arrivals of RT Jonah Williams (2 years, $30 million), DTs Justin Jones (3 years, $31.2 million) and Bilal Nichols (3 years, $21 million) and CB Sean Murphy-Bunting (3 years, $25.5 million) plus departures of WR Hollywood Brown and LT D.J. Humphries (released). The trade of WR Rondale Moore to Atlanta for QB Desmond Ridder allowed GM Monti Ossenfort to offload an underachieving player while stabilizing the backup situation behind Kyler Murray.\n\nPLAY TO WIN $5K: USA TODAY's Pro Football Survivor Pool is free to enter. Sign up now!\n\nOverall, necessary if not overly costly or sexy moves – and those could come in the draft, when Ossenfort has six of the top 90 selections, including two first-rounders. But this team is operating like it’s still at least a year away from contention, which it probably is.\n\nAtlanta Falcons: A\n\nMaybe they watched Netflix’s “Quarterback” last summer and fell in love with Kirk Cousins – the documentary also featured former Falcons QB Marcus Mariota – but GM Terry Fontenot and new coach Raheem Morris got their guy and addressed this franchise’s most pressing issue … with the help of a four-year, $180 million contract. Cousins, who will be 36 by Week 1, still has to get his surgically repaired Achilles into shape but, otherwise, almost no excuses left for this club – especially when it comes to vying for the NFC South throne.\n\nAnd that’s largely because Fontenot made other consequential moves, getting field-stretching WR Darnell Mooney at great cost (3 years, $39 million) and trading former QB1 Ridder for Moore, who may only need a change of scenery to realize his explosive potential. Might be nice to have unsigned DL Calais Campbell back, and former WR Calvin Ridley’s move to Tennessee (rather than remaining with the Jags ahead of official free agency) cost Fontenot a second-round pick as a condition of the 2022 trade with Jacksonville … but those are nitpicks, especially since Ridley still returned a third-rounder.\n\nBaltimore Ravens: B\n\nWhile acknowledging the team’s limited cap space at the start of free agency, hard not to be enamored of the retention of breakout DT Justin Madubuike (4 years, $98 million) and arrival of RB Derrick Henry (2 years, $16 million) given the schematic pickle he and two-time MVP Lamar Jackson will put defenses into. LB Patrick Queen, S Geno Stone, KR/WR Devin Duvernay and RBs Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins should be survivable losses, and unsigned veterans like DE Jadeveon Clowney and WR Odell Beckham Jr. seemed like aging luxuries.\n\nBut hard not to be concerned about an offensive line that lost three starters given the imperative to protect Jackson and recalibrate this attack with Henry. Still, good year to obtain blocking reinforcements in the draft.\n\nBuffalo Bills: B\n\nA team that had major salary cap issues to work through is going to look different – perhaps better depending how new pieces fall into place. GM Brandon Beane paid less for a fundamentally different receiver in Curtis Samuel (3 years, $24 million) rather than hold on to Gabe Davis. The team reinvested heavily in LT Dion Dawkins and slot CB Taron Johnson, while D-lineman A.J. Epenesa and DaQuan Jones also stuck around.\n\nBut a lot of depth is out the door, not to mention major leadership provided by C Mitch Morse, CB Tre’Davious White and the longtime safety combo of Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Maybe the window is closing ... or maybe Beane and HC Sean McDermott made necessary adjustments for a team that’s ruled the AFC East but hasn’t been able to do a whole lot beyond that.\n\nCarolina Panthers: D+\n\nThey probably overspent for Gs Robert Hunt (5 years, $100 million) and Damien Lewis (4 years, $53 million), but it’s defensible given the mandate to safeguard QB Bryce Young in Year 2. DL A’Shawn Robinson (3 years, $22.5 million), LB Josey Jewell (3 years, $18.8 million) and OLB D.J. Wonnum (2 years, $12.5 million) join the defense, Wonnum perhaps a crafty addition coming off an eight-sack season in Minnesota. Trading CB Donte Jackson to Pittsburgh for WR Diontae Johnson could be a win-win swap.\n\nYet it feels like those moves are overshadowed by the loss of kinetic LB Frankie Luvu and, certainly, OLB Brian Burns. Initially franchised, Burns (46 career sacks), 25, was portrayed as a cornerstone in Charlotte. If the organization decided a trade was mutually beneficial, then fine. But with the compensation essentially just a second- and fifth-round pick, far less than the Panthers were purportedly offered by the Rams just two years ago, this deal really seemed to mostly benefit Burns and the Giants, who also extended him. Why not simply keep him on the tag and/or move him later? After all, the Giants got the same value for DL Leonard Williams at the trade deadline last year.\n\nChicago Bears: A-\n\nIf all you knew was that they’d fetched a conditional sixth-rounder for QB Justin Fields – and he apparently had something to do with that – you’d assume March had been a disastrous month.\n\nHardly.\n\nGM Ryan Poles had already extended CB Jaylon Johnson (4 years, $76 million), added RB D’Andre Swift (3 years, $24 million), TE Gerald Everett (2 years, $12 million) and S Kevin Byard (2 years, $15 million) to reasonable contracts, all before obtaining Pro Bowl slot WR Keenan Allen for a Round 4 pick. The future is uncertain for Fields, but his replacement can eagerly anticipate a situation completely foreign to the one Fields walked into under the previous regime three years ago.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: C-\n\nFeels like a series of mostly lateral moves, OT Trent Brown replacing Jonah Williams, RB Zack Moss (2 years, $8 million) replacing Joe Mixon, DT Sheldon Rankins (2 years, $24.5 million) replacing D.J. Reader. The new safety couplet of Stone and Vonn Bell is nice. But the unresolved situation around franchised WR Tee Higgins? Not so much.\n\nCleveland Browns: B-\n\nOn paper, they had a pair of nice wins, acquiring and extending WR Jerry Jeudy (3 years, up to $58 million) for a pair of Day 3 draft picks and re-signing DE Za’Darius Smith (2 years, $23 million). The Browns swapped out less noteworthy players at other positions, though their Deshaun Watson insurance plan seems diminished after saying goodbye to 2023 Comeback Player of the Year Joe Flacco in lieu of Jameis Winston. Be interesting to see how a wild-card entry largely runs it back with Watson and RB Nick Chubb.\n\nDallas Cowboys: I\n\nYes, that’s “I” for incomplete. Blame the front office, blame the quarterback, blame all parties. But until Dak Prescott’s contract is extended beyond 2024, “America’s Team” is effectively unable to conduct other significant business, which would include a new deal for All-Pro WR CeeDee Lamb and maybe even one for LB Micah Parsons.\n\nWhile the volume of the exodus feels biblical – DE Dorance Armstrong, C Tyler Biadasz, DE Dante Fowler Jr., CB Noah Igbinoghene (all four gone to Washington), DT Neville Gallimore, LT Tyron Smith, RB Tony Pollard and WR Michael Gallup – a team that’s drafted as well as Dallas has recently should be able to largely compensate … maybe more so if the gridlock with Prescott resolves.\n\nDenver Broncos: B\n\nIt isn’t fun but, in the long run, also decidedly better to take your lumps now as it pertains to the expensive release of QB Russell Wilson, popular FS Justin Simmons and trade of Jeudy rather than prolong the misery for all parties. Necessary cap and/or organizational medicine. See ya in 2025.\n\nDetroit Lions: B+\n\nAdding Reader (2 years, $22 million), DE Marcus Davenport (1 year, $6.5 million) and G Kevin Zeitler and re-signing G Graham Glasgow (3 years, $20 million) is collectively a virtual wash compared to what keeping G Jonah Jackson, who left for the Rams, would have cost. Throw in the trade for CB Carlton Davis III, and it’s been a fairly low-key but seemingly fruitful week for the NFC North champs.\n\nGreen Bay Packers: A-\n\nA team that rarely makes a ripple in free agency caused a pair of splashes by signing RB Josh Jacobs (4 years, $48 million) and SS Xavier McKinney (4 years, $67 million), perhaps the best available players at their respective positions. Re-signing KR/CB Keisean Nixon (3 years, $18 million) was a slick, underrated transaction. It was time to part with LT David Bakhtiari and RB Aaron Jones, given the arrival of Jacobs, and wise to allow other bidders to overpay for S Darnell Savage and G Jon Runyan Jr.\n\n(Likely) next up? A megadeal for QB Jordan Love.\n\nHouston Texans: B-\n\nQuite a bit of churn for the AFC South champs. The highlights? In: DE Danielle Hunter (2 years, $49 million); out: popular DE Jonathan Greenard. In: LB Azeez Al-Shaair (3 years, $34 million); out: LB Blake Cashman. In: DL Denico Autry (2 years, $20 million); out: Rankins. In: Mixon via trade; out: RB Devin Singletary. The new three-year contracts for TE Dalton Schultz ($36 million) and K Ka’imi Fairbairn ($15.9 million) almost get lost in the shuffle. And then there was GM Nick Caserio’s trade of his final Round 1 selection from the Watson deal to Minnesota, essentially for a pair of second-rounders.\n\nOverall? TBD, though feels like a lot of money was spent for what might only be incremental gains.\n\nIndianapolis Colts: B\n\nCongrats to GM Chris Ballard for finally utilizing the franchise tag, retaining and ultimately paying (3 years, $70 million) WR Michael Pittman Jr. Otherwise? Kind of a standard Indy offseason, Ballard prioritizing his own by extending LB Zaire Franklin (3 years, $31.3 million) and re-upping DT Grover Stewart (3 years, $39 million), nickel Kenny Moore II (3 years, $30 million) and DE Tyquan Lewis (2 years, $12 million). Unsurprisingly, Pro Bowl QB2 Gardner Minshew II is headed elsewhere (Las Vegas), replaced by Flacco … whose game doesn’t exactly mirror starter Anthony Richardson’s.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: D+\n\nThey paid big time for DT Arik Armstead (3 years, $51 million), WR Gabe Davis (3 years, $39 million) and Savage (3 years, $21.8 million) – maybe too much? – while keeping OL Ezra Cleveland on a three-year, $24 million pact. Also, did the Jags get too cute waiting to re-sign Ridley, knowing it would cost them a second-round pick to do so rather than surrendering the third-rounder to Atlanta as was stipulated by their 2022 deal if he reached the market? Welp, reach the market he did, jumping to Tennessee, but admitting he’d wanted to remain in Duval County.\n\nKansas City Chiefs: A\n\nThey locked up All-Pro DT Chris Jones with a five-year, $158.8 million megadeal. The two-time defending champs also re-signed LB Drue Tranquill (3 years, $19 million), added speedy Hollywood Brown (1 year, $7 million) and retain the rights to franchised CB L’Jarius Sneed. Nice job keeping the band together while adding a backup singer. Helps when your quarterback is willing to free up nearly $22 million by restructuring his deal … which could help eventually fill that hole at left tackle.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders: B+\n\nThe four-year, $110 million investment in DT Christian Wilkins immediately gives them one of the league’s scariest defensive fronts, DE Maxx Crosby an even more serious threat to be Defensive Player of the Year in 2024. Minshew (2 years, $25 million) couldn’t be a worse bridge than Jimmy Garoppolo was last year – the question being where is that bridge leading? Yet given Minshew’s propensity to sling it, perhaps the loss of Jacobs won’t sting nearly as much. Keeping C Andre James (3 years, $24 million) was a nice stroke.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: C\n\nThe Bolts are slowly changing their identity under new HC Jim Harbaugh and GM Joe Hortiz. Unfortunately, when you’re capped out, you consider losing just one of your top players previously under contract (WR Mike Williams) a victory while sprinkling in a new hammer back (Edwards) and blocking tight end (Will Dissly) for less than $5 million annually per man.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: B\n\nThere’s no positive spin to the retirement of singular DL Aaron Donald. But the Rams knew it was coming and had a plan to redistribute their resources and priorities. That meant beefing up the guard position in front of QB Matthew Stafford, adding Jonah Jackson (3 years, $51 million) and re-signing Kevin Dotson (3 years, $48 million) while also firming up the Plan B QB by importing Garoppolo. New TE Colby Parkinson (3 years, $22.5 million) provides an insurance policy for injured Tyler Higbee and will also contribute to an offense that will likely have to score more. CB Darious Williams essentially got the same money as Parkinson to return to LA. This team will have to win differently, yet it should be capable of doing so.\n\nMiami Dolphins: C-\n\nThey’re entering a phase that requires them to offload highly paid (or about-to-be-paid) veterans and pivot to cheaper ones while clearing the decks to enrich QB Tua Tagovailoa. So goodbye to Wilkins, Hunt, CB Xavien Howard, LB Andrew Van Ginkel, DE Emmanuel Ogbah, LB Jerome Baker and hello to Gallimore, Poyer, LB Shaq Barrett and LB Anthony Walker Jr., who all arrive on one-year deals. LB Jordyn Brooks (3 years, $26.3 million), C Aaron Brewer (3 years, $21 million) and CB Kendall Fuller (2 years, $15 million) were compensated moderately better.\n\nTua is about to get his bag, but a roster that wasn’t up to winning playoff games previously now seems necessarily diluted given how grossly overspent the Fins were before becoming cap compliant.\n\nMinnesota Vikings: C-\n\nTheir most compelling decisions thus far have been allowing Cousins out of the building before later acquiring a second Round 1 draft pick from Houston – which seems like an obvious step in the process of replacing the quarterback. From a pass rush perspective, GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah effectively swapped Hunter, who’s making more annually, to the Texans for Greenard (4 years, $76 million). Otherwise, feels like some temps here (QB Sam Darnold, Aaron Jones, CB Shaquill Griffin) with value plays in Cashman (3 years, $22.5 million) and Van Ginkel (2 years, $20 million).\n\nAnd how does All-Pro WR Justin Jefferson, who’s now awaiting a contract and a quarterback feel about all of this? Might be a roughly $200 million question.\n\nNew England Patriots: B+\n\nA team that had roughly $70 million in cap space when the free agent negotiating window opened March 11 has been fairly off the radar – the most noteworthy spends on three-year reinvestments for OL Mike Onwenu ($57 million), TE Hunter Henry ($30 million) and WR Kendrick Bourne ($19.5 million) plus the return of QB Jacoby Brissett (1 year, $8 million) and low-cost signing of RB Antonio Gibson (3 years, $11.3 million). Remains to be seen what else happens behind center following the trade of Mac Jones to Jacksonville.\n\nAdmittedly, not exciting stuff for a team that’s yet to win a playoff game since QB Tom Brady’s departure and one that missed out on securing Ridley. But the moderation is probably wise as new director of scouting Eliot Wolf and HC Jerod Mayo try to get this program back on the rails in a sustainable manner. (And don’t worry, title-starved Pats Nation, plenty of cap room moving forward for when it’s appropriate to really upgrade the roster.)\n\nNew Orleans Saints: C-\n\nAside from a few minor pickups (LB Willie Gay, WR Cedrick Wilson Jr., QB2 Nathan Peterman) before landing DE Chase Young on a one-year, $13 million offer this week, they’ve pretty much sat on the sideline while restructuring contracts throughout the roster as they do yearly. A more measured approach was going to be needed here eventually.\n\nNew York Giants: C\n\nDecidedly mixed bag, starting with the exits of McKinney and RB Saquon Barkley, their top free agents. Stealing Burns from Carolina and locking him up (5 years, $141 million) was a major offset. Bolstering the O-line with Runyan (3 years, $30 million) and Jermaine Eluemunor (2 years, $14 million) was smart given the state of affairs there. But Singletary (3 years, $16.5 million) is hardly equipped to elevate an offense seemingly devoid of reliable weapons … which probably relegates QB Daniel Jones (or maybe his replacement) to another failed campaign.\n\nNew York Jets: A-\n\nGM Joe Douglas knows his job is on the line, yet he bided his time while waiting to allocate the club’s limited cap dollars. It appears to have been a wise strategy.\n\nAn offensive line that let this team down throughout 2023 has three new starters after Douglas traded for RT Morgan Moses and signed G John Simpson (2 years, $12 million) – both played for Baltimore last season – before landing Tyron Smith, whose one-year, $6.5 million deal could balloon to $20 million if he reaches his incentives. Tuesday, Douglas secured power forward Mike Williams on a one-year arrangement that could pay him up to $15 million. Deadeye K Greg Zuerlein re-signed for two years, and even the QB2 situation seems far better settled with Tyrod Taylor (2 years, $12 million) coming across town from the Giants.\n\nGiven the health red flags surrounding Smith, whose last full season occurred in 2015, and Williams (ACL recovery), their signings are calculated risks – though maybe not so much for Douglas and HC Robert Saleh, who have little to lose at this point. But even at the cost of some of the Jets’ vaunted D-line depth, particularly the departure of uber-efficient pass rusher Bryce Huff, this was probably the optimal course of action in a bid to maximize Year 2 with QB Aaron Rodgers.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: A-\n\nMajor leadership depreciation following the retirements of C Jason Kelce and DT Fletcher Cox – though it’s not like wisdom managed to save the failed 2023 campaign. But the Eagles took a newfound opportunity to level up elsewhere.\n\nBarkley (3 years, $37.8 million), the type of player EVP/GM Howie Roseman typically doesn’t shell out for, could be a beast behind this blocking and given the other playmakers – including new WR3 DeVante Parker – who command attention. Barkley’s arrival also directly damages the division rival Giants. The return of DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson should restore an urgency to the defense, and retaining DEs Josh Sweat and LB Haason Reddick while adding Huff (3 years, $51 million) to the mix spells renewed trouble for opposing quarterbacks. If that’s not enough, G Landon Dickerson signed a massive extension (4 years, $84 million), and K Jake Elliott got one of his own (4 years, $24 million).\n\nBeware, Dallas.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers: B+\n\nFor the price of $1.2 million (Russell Wilson) and a conditional sixth-rounder next year (Fields), they’ve vastly upgraded their quarterback room, which says goodbye to Mason Rudolph, Mitch Trubisky and former first-rounder Kenny Pickett. TBD how it all shakes out, but the Wilson-Fields combo should give this a team a better opportunity to win in January beyond its nine or 10 regular-season victories.\n\nThe big money went to Queen (3 years, $41 million), who will attempt to solve a long-running inside linebacker issue but must prove he can be Batman and not just the Robin he was next to Roquan Smith in Baltimore. Also feels like there’s more to be done at receiver than the pickup of Van Jefferson after trading Diontae Johnson to Carolina for Donte Jackson.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: B\n\nWith little room to maneuver, it’s been fairly quiet in Silicon Valley, though the NFC champs remain loaded for bear on what could be a final all-in Super Bowl push before they have to pay QB Brock Purdy. Newly signed pass rushers Leonard Floyd (2 years, $20 million) and Yetur Gross-Matos (2 years, $18 million) likely won’t offset the subtraction of Armstead, Chase Young, Clelin Ferrell, Javon Kinlaw and others on the front. But former All-Pro LB De’Vondre Campbell should be a solid stopgap until Dre Greenlaw (Super Bowl 58 Achilles injury) can return.\n\nTBD if GM John Lynch still has a surprise ace up his sleeve and/or if WR Brandon Aiyuk will be extended beyond 2024.\n\nSeattle Seahawks: B-\n\nThe optics and money were challenging, but a team in transition cleaned out an overpriced and underperforming safety room (Jamal Adams, Quandre Diggs). LB Bobby Wagner will be missed. Brooks also, but probably better for new HC Mike Macdonald to find younger pieces – LB Tyrel Dodson, 25, formerly of Buffalo, might be one – to execute his defense and take his lumps in the interim with fill-ins like Baker (1 year, $7 million) and S Rayshawn Jenkins (2 years, $12 million).\n\nNice that Leonard Williams (3 years, $64.5 million), and TE Noah Fant (2 years, $21 million) are sticking around, while the trade for Sam Howell keeps the quarterback room diversified. However the O-line remains a mess, especially between the tackles.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: A\n\nWR Mike Evans? Re-signed (2 years, $41 million). QB Baker Mayfield? Re-signed (3 years, $100 million). LB Lavonte David? Re-signed. K Chase McLaughlin? Re-signed (3 years, $12.3 million). All-Pro FS Antoine Winfield Jr.? Franchised (for now). SS Jordan Whitehead? Returning to Tampa (2 years, $9 million).\n\nBarrett and Carlton Davis are gone, but that’s the cost of doing the business of keeping the three-time-defending NFC South champs nearly intact from 2023. There are still some areas to address, but relative continuity is very often predictive of sustained success in the NFL.\n\nTennessee Titans: C\n\nThey had roughly $80 million in cap space, more than any other AFC team, when the negotiating window opened. By collective bargaining rules, they had to spend a good amount of that … but the Titans seemed especially aggressive despite the appearance they’re near the start of a rebuild after saying goodbye to Derrick Henry, HC Mike Vrabel and QB Ryan Tannehill.\n\nNevertheless, GM Ran Carthon ponied up for Ridley (4 years, $92 million), even though he’s never truly established himself as a No. 1 receiver, C Lloyd Cushenberry (4 years, $50 million), CB Chidobe Awuzie (3 years, $36 million), Pollard (3 years, $21 million), and LB Kenneth Murray (2 years, $15.5 million), among others. Feels like a heavy expenditure for players who come with performance questions and seem unlikely to lift this team out of the AFC South cellar in 2024. But Carthon also had to provide second-year QB Will Levis and rookie HC Brian Callahan with ammunition.\n\nWashington Commanders: B+\n\nThey had roughly $100 million in cap space, more than any other team, when the negotiating window opened. By collective bargaining rules, they had to spend a good amount of that … and rookie GM Adam Peters seemed to do that rather creatively, yet without overleveraging the Commanders before their rebuild is truly down the tracks.\n\nAfter poaching new HC Dan Quinn from the Cowboys, Peters took direct aim at the NFC East champs’ roster, plucking Armstrong (3 years, $33 million), Biadasz (3 years, $29.3 million), Fowler and Igbinoghene to blow a few holes into Dallas’ depth chart. Peters added other known commodities without paying premium prices for the likes of Wagner (also a Quinn veteran from Seattle), RB Austin Ekeler, TE Zach Ertz, G Nick Allegretti, Mariota, WR Jamison Crowder, S Jeremy Chinn and Ferrell. Yet the biggest heist might be stealing Luvu (3 years, $31 million). For an organization in the midst of a holistic reboot, what seems like a tempered roster reset is likely appropriate until more foundational components – namely QB1 following the departures of Howell and Brissett – are determined.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/08/17/braves-new-contracts-set-them-up-for-long-term-success/50610773/", "title": "Braves' new contracts set them up for long-term success", "text": "AP\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Hey, Braves fans, hope you like the core of your team.\n\nYou're gonna be cheering them on for a while.\n\nThe reigning World Series champions have moved aggressively to lock up their most vital players to long-term contracts.\n\nRookie sensation Michael Harris II is the latest to plant his roots in Atlanta, agreeing to an eight-year deal worth at least $72 million just 71 games into his big league career.\n\nHarris, only 21 and the youngest player in the majors, could make $102 million over the next decade if the Braves pick up a pair of option years in 2031 and '32.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\n“I've never thought about the year 2030,” Harris said Wednesday, chuckling a bit. “That's far.”\n\nNot too far for the Braves, who have taken an aggressive approach when it comes to locking down players with lengthy deals long before they're eligible for free agency.\n\nAll-Star third baseman Austin Riley, who was already under team control for three more years, agreed to a $212 million, 10-year contract that could keep him with the Braves through 2032.\n\nThat became the richest deal in team history, surpassing the $168 million, eight-year pact that Matt Olson signed in March after the Braves cut ties with Freddie Freeman and pulled off a blockbuster trade with the Oakland A's to acquire another slugging first baseman.\n\nThe Braves already secured All-Star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. and second baseman Ozzie Albies, currently on the injured list with a broken foot, to deals that now look like absolute bargains in today's marketplace.\n\nAlbies is committed to the Braves for another five years — at just $7 million per season — if the team picks up a pair of option years in a deal he agreed to in 2019, before he was even eligible for arbitration.\n\nAcuña followed a similar path less than two weeks after Albies' contract was signed, signing a $100 million, eight-year deal after a brilliant debut campaign that earned him NL Rookie of the Year honors. The Braves have a pair of team options attached to that contract, as well, which could keep Acuña in Atlanta through 2028 for an additional $34 million.\n\nTo recap, that means five key members of Atlanta's lineup are all under contract through at least 2027.\n\nIn fact, virtually the entire roster has a contract for next season or is under team control, setting the team up for the sort of consistent success that marked their record run of 14 straight division titles in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThis generation of Braves has claimed four straight NL East titles and is trying to chase down the division-leading New York Mets.\n\nGeneral manager Alex Anthopoulos took a bit of a jab at another Atlanta team, the NFL Falcons, while discussing his franchise's philosophy.\n\n“The No. 1 thing I worry about is being sustainable,” Anthopoulos said. “When I first got to Atlanta, I listened to talk radio and tried to get a feel for the city, the market. I remember seeing Mercedes-Benz (Stadium, the home of the Falcons) half-empty midway through a season and the Atlanta Falcons were playing in the Super Bowl two years earlier. It was eye-opening to me.”\n\nThe only potential stumbling block to the Braves' stability is shortstop Dansby Swanson, who can become a free agent after the season.\n\nAnthopoulos said the team is hopeful of bringing him back, but wouldn't go into specifics over whether a deal might be in the works.\n\nSpeaking of deals, the Braves have clearly flourished since receiving hundreds of millions in public funds for a new suburban stadium that opened in 2017, along with an adjoining, team-owned development of condos, offices, hotels, bars and restaurants known as The Battery.\n\nTeam owner Liberty Media reported revenue of $260 million in the second quarter, an increase of more than 20% over the same period a year earlier. The team’s first World Series title since 1995 also has provided a significant financial boost, with the Braves on pace to surpass 3 million in attendance for the first time since 2000.\n\nFlush with money, the team has jumped at the chance to pursue deals that provide advantages for both sides.\n\nThe player gets more money up front, during the years before arbitration when they're basically forced to play at or just above the league minimum of $700,000.\n\nHarris, for example, will make $5 million each of the next two years, when he would not have been eligible for arbitration. That rises to $8 million for 2025 and ‘26, and $9 million the following year, which covers his three-year arbitration cycle.\n\nBut this contract — as with those previous deals — becomes extremely favorable to the team if Harris lives up to the potential he has shown in the first three months of his career. He is hitting .287 with 12 homers, 39 RBIs and 13 stolen bases while providing stellar defense in center field.\n\nThe Braves could really be sitting pretty with terms that call for him to make $10 million in both 2028 and '29 and $12 million in 2030. The two team options — $15 million in 2031, $20 million in 2032 — each come with a $5 million buyout.\n\nThat's a big financial commitment by the Braves, of course, but they'll have no regrets if Harris turns out to be a big star.\n\nNeither will Harris, a native of metro Atlanta who grew up a Braves fan. He was willing to potentially leave a lot of money on the table for the chance to remain in his hometown for another decade.\n\n“It's a life-changing moment,” Harris said. “For me to be so young, and for the Braves to even consider me to be part of this organization for that long, it's a blessing and something I can't really put into words.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/08/11/highest-paid-nfl-linebackers-salary-2023-season/70548126007/", "title": "Highest-paid NFL linebackers: Top-paid LBs in 2023 salary rankings", "text": "A midseason trade from the Chicago Bears to the Baltimore Ravens worked out quite well for Roquan Smith.\n\nSmith escaped Chicago, an NFC North doormat, for a team that regularly contends for the playoffs.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is five things you need to know. Saturday the 21st of October 2023. Today, two American hostages have been freed by Hamas, plus the House remains in limbo without a speaker, and another co-defendant in the Georgia election case has pleaded guilty.\n\n♦\n\nTwo American hostages taken by Hamas earlier this month have been freed. Judith Tai Raanan, and her teen daughter, Natalie Shoshana Raanan, had been visiting Israel from their home in suburban Chicago. They were staying in a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip when Hamas attacked on October 7th. The pair was released by Hamas' armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which said they were freed for humanitarian reasons according to a Reuters report.\n\nTheir release came as Israeli military forces continued slamming Gaza with heavy airstrikes yesterday. They even hit areas in the south of Gaza where Palestinians had been told to seek safety. That's prompted many to return north. Since Hamas attacked Israel earlier this month, Israel has bombarded the Strip and cut it off from major resources. At the Egypt-Gaza border, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters that restrictions are preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration has formally asked Congress for more than $105 billion in emergency funding for the wars in both Israel and Ukraine, earmarking some 10 billion for Israel military support. That's after Biden announced a fraction of that, $100 million dollars in assistance for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. In this month's war, the Israel Defense Forces said yesterday that more than 1,400 people have died. In Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said around 4,100 have died.\n\n♦\n\nThe House enters its third weekend without a speaker after Ohio Republican Jim Jordan failed to win enough votes for the third time. In the latest round of voting for the speaker's chair, 25 Republicans voted against him. House Republicans have now dropped Jordan as their nominee, throwing the chamber into even more chaos. They'll now break for the weekend and return on Monday for a candidate forum to hear from prospective speakers.\n\nAfter the forum, they'll hold another internal vote to determine a nominee on Tuesday. A mad dash for the speaker job has now begun with some members immediately declaring their candidacy and other lawmakers said they would seriously consider running over the weekend. You can read more with the link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAnother co-defendant with Donald Trump in the Georgia election conspiracy case has pleaded guilty. I spoke with USA Today Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen about Kenneth Chesebro and what his guilty plea might mean for the case going forward. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, let's start here. Who is Kenneth Chesebro and what was he charged with initially in this case?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nHe was a private lawyer who wound up offering a bunch of advice on the 2020 election to President Trump's campaign and to Republican officials in the half-dozen states that were the most closely contested that they were trying to flip from President Joe Biden to Trump in order for Trump to win the 2020 election.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd he pleaded guilty here. What did he agree to as part of this plea?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nHe had been accused of a half-dozen charges dealing with developing the scheme for recruiting fake electors, these presidential electors that serve from each state that basically represent the voting in that state for either the Republican or the Democrat.\n\nIn Georgia's case, of course, the state went for President Joe Biden, but Chesebro and a couple of others drafted these memos that explained, well, maybe we should have Republicans meet and vote as if they are presidential electors. And then fill out the certificates, fill out paperwork to send to the National Archives and to Congress to be counted as if Georgia actually went for the Republicans. Now it didn't, that's why those documents are fake.\n\nAnd so what Chesebro pleaded guilty to is conspiracy to submit a false document. That charge carries a potential five-year sentence. He was given a five-year probationary sentence and ordered to pay some restitution. If he completes that sentence as agreed, he will be able to wipe his record clean, and part of the agreement is to testify against other co-defendants in this case.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou mentioned other co-defendants, Sidney Powell also pleaded guilty in this case this week. We know another co-defendant, Scott Hall, did the same last month. What might these plea agreements mean for testimony during the trials of other co-defendants going forward?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe case is sprawling. There were 19 co-defendants to start. Former President Donald Trump and lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, are a couple of the marquee names, but there are a total of 19 people. Now we've had three of them plead guilty and agree to testify against the others. What it looks like is each of these three at least offer a perspective on different aspects of the conspiracy.\n\nSo in Chesebro's case, he gives you a bird's eye view of the fake elector scheme and how the prosecutors described in court on Friday that he was communicating with Trump and with Giuliani to recruit fake electors to ask the Republican National Committee to help recruit them, and then to provide them with these fake certificates and to give them detailed instructions about how to fill them out. So from Chesebro, you get the description of the fake elector scheme.\n\nSidney Powell, another campaign lawyer was somebody who was raising widespread claims of voter fraud, all of which was baseless. She pleaded guilty to a handful of misdemeanors dealing with ... The accusation was that a group of people tampered with election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia, and she gives you the window into the folks that did that.\n\nAnd then Scott Hall is a bail bondsman, but he was sort of a go-between or a logistics guy for other co-defendants in the case. He wound up helping get people to the Coffee County offices to deal with that election equipment.\n\nHe also wound up spending more than an hour on the phone with Jeffrey Clark, a former Assistant Attorney General who drafted a letter full of false statements from the Justice Department to Georgia officials that talked about concerns about the 2020 election as if there had been fraud. There was not widespread fraud.\n\nActing Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to sign the letter. And so, Scott Hall had an hour long conversation with Jeffrey Clark on January 2nd. Of course, we all know what unfolded on January 6th, 2021, when there was the riot at the Capitol Building.\n\nSo each one of these people provides a different perspective for different aspects of this overall conspiracy, which Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has called a racketeering conspiracy to try to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Bart Janssen covers the Justice Department for USA Today. Thank you, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, former president Donald Trump has been fined $5,000 in his New York civil trial because a social media post disparaging one of the judge's staffers remained visible for weeks.\n\nIn other court news, the Supreme Court yesterday tentatively sided with the Biden administration and agreed to decide a dispute about whether officials in the White House and federal agencies violated the First Amendment when they leaned on social media companies to suppress content about the election and COVID-19. Without comment, a majority of the justices halted a lower court's order that blocked federal agencies from coercing social media companies to take down certain posts.\n\nThe move allows the Biden administration to continue to interact with social media platforms like Facebook and X to request that they remove disinformation. And by agreeing to decide the underlying issues in the coming months, the high court is again throwing itself into a divisive fight at the intersection of social media and the government.\n\n♦\n\nMore school buses around the country could be getting Wi-Fi after a vote this week from the FCC. I spoke with USA Today breaking news and education reporter, Zach Schermele, to learn more. Zach, thanks for hopping on 5 Things.\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo let's start here. What did the Federal Communications Commission decide on Thursday about school bus Wi-Fi?\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nSo basically the five commissioners adopted what's known as a declaratory ruling, which essentially allows the school districts across the country to use money from something called the E-Rate program, which is a program that helps schools and libraries buy affordable broadband toward Wi-Fi and technology on their school buses. It was a three to two vote along party lines.\n\nThe E-Rate program is paid for by a system of subsidies and fees from telecommunications companies. Basically what this ruling lets districts do is use some of that money to retrofit their buses with Wi-Fi, or if they've already done that, put this money toward Wi-Fi on their buses in the future.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Zach, this move is aimed at rural students in particular. Why is that?\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nThere's really gross disparities in this country in terms of internet access for all children and students, even as most schools increasingly rely on technology for their curricular needs.\n\nJust taking a quick look at some of the latest available data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which is a data collecting arm of the education department. Even if we look at 2019, 5% of all 5 to 17 year old students, that sounds like small potatoes but it's roughly 2.4 million students, lived in homes without internet access that year.\n\nAnd according to a survey that was conducted recently by the Consortium for School Networking, which is an education technology group, only about 13% of districts nationwide say they actually provide Wi-Fi on their school buses.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you touched on some of this, but why do advocates say this is such a good idea, broadly?\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nThe proposal was supported by Democrats on the commission and a significant amount of Democrats in Congress as well. They lauded it as a way of supporting students, particularly those in those rural areas that I mentioned who have potentially lengthy commutes to and from school. They said that greater access to Wi-Fi would help to close disparities in homework completion, in academic success. There are some studies that show that a greater access to broadband can help a student in the classroom academically.\n\nJessica Rosenworcel, who is the Democratic chairwoman of the commission said that she recently took a trip to Vermont, where she heard a story about a girl there who at the end of every day would rush to the library, just before the bus left, and furiously printed out all of her assignments so that she could write them out physically on the school bus. And she called that student somebody with extraordinary grit, but said it shouldn't have to be that hard to do homework.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd so what issues do critics have here, Zach?\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nLike many education issues nowadays, this is something that has met some criticism, particularly in Congress. Senator Ted Cruz is a notable critic of this particular proposal. He sent a letter last month to several folks involved with this issue, raising concerns about what he called subsidizing unsupervised internet access to social media sites like TikTok. He said that addictive and distracting social media apps are inviting every evil force on the planet into kids' classrooms.\n\nA superintendent that I spoke to in Vermont named Matt Fedders, said the devices on the buses in his district, however, are going to have all the same firewalls and security measures as the network does in his school building. So he said that some of those concerns from congressional Republicans don't necessarily hold water.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Zach Schermele, thank you so much for your insight here. Really appreciate it.\n\nZach Schermele:\n\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd did you know that today is National Apple Day? It's a good chance to drink some cider, bake a pie, or head out to your nearest orchard.\n\n♦\n\nAnd thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Among JT’s No. 1 hits now under their control include “SexyBack,” “Can’t Stop the Feeling” and “Mirrors.”\n\nThe dollar figure behind the deal has not been disclosed, but people familiar with the matter have it valued upwards of $100 million, according to the The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTimberlake’s music collection spans over 20 years. The singer found fame in 1995 as a member of boy band phenomenon NSYNC. Following the international breakout success of the group, Timberlake launched a solo career that has included five studio albums and 40 singles.\n\nThe sale took over a year to close, according to Mercuriadis, and is part of a rising trend of megastars selling their music catalogs who include the likes of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young and Stevie Nicks. At 41 years old, however, Timberlake is younger than the other musical icons inking deals.\n\n“A lot of the artists that are selling their catalogs are getting to a point in their lives where they are planning their estates, sort of planning for the future and they are at a point in their lives where it makes sense to sell their music to provide for their families,” Hannah Karp, editorial director at Billboard told CNN.\n\nTimberlake is not alone among younger stars getting immediate payouts for their younger work with Hipgnosis. The Chainsmokers, an electronic music hit maker duo, sold their catalog to the firm in 2019, and Shakira struck a deal with Hipgnosis in January.\n\n“In the case of those younger songwriters, they’re looking to de-risk their future,” Mercuriadis told CNN Business. “They’re looking to be put in a position where they can make music for pure purposes going forward based on what they want to do, as opposed to what they have to do for money.”\n\nOther artists who have made deals with Hipgnosis include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Journey, Blondie and Neil Young.\n\n“I am excited to be partnering with Merck and Hipgnosis – he values artists and their creative work and has always been a strong supporter of songwriters and storytelling,” said Timberlake in a press release Thursday. “I look forward to entering this next chapter.”\n\nThe deal covers Timberlake’s publishing rights only, so only songs that he had a hand in writing are included in the deal. While Timberlake has written or co-written many of the songs that have brought him solo success – and several songs for other artists such as Rihanna and Madonna – the same is not true for a large chunk of NSYNC’s musical catalog. That means hits like “Bye Bye Bye” lie outside the scope of the Hipgnosis deal.\n\nThe purchase was made on behalf of Hipgnosis Songs Capital, a $1 billion partnership between Hipgnosis Song Management and funds managed by private equity firm Blackstone (BGB).

The statement notes that Chess.com is “saddened” by Niemann’s decision as the lawsuit “hurts the game of chess and its devoted players.”\n\n“Hans confessed publicly to cheating online in the wake of the Sinquefield Cup, and the resulting fallout is of his own making,” the statement adds. “As stated in its October 2022 report, Chess.com had historically dealt with Hans’ prior cheating privately, and was forced to clarify its position only after he spoke out publicly.”\n\n“There is no merit to Hans’ allegations, and Chess.com looks forward to setting the record straight on behalf of its team and all honest chess players,” the statement says.\n\nCNN has reached out to Carlsen and Nakamura for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/03/12/nfl-free-agency-trades-grades/72947208007/", "title": "NFL free agency, trades: Grades for the biggest moves so far", "text": "The two-day legal tampering period of the 2024 NFL offseason has come and gone with many high-profile free agents agreeing to big deals to change teams.

Sign up now!\n\nHunter is arguably the best non-quarterback free agent this offseason. Despite having eight years of experience, Hunter is still just 29 years old and is coming off arguably his best season in the NFL. In 2023, he set career-highs with 16.5 sacks (fifth-most in the league) and 23 tackles for loss (tied for the league-high). The four-time Pro Bowler has missed just 10 games since becoming a full-time starter in 2017.\n\nHe will turn 30 during the season but gives the Texans a veteran presence at a key spot. Houston's defense will face Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, and Aaron Rodgers this upcoming season so stocking up on reliable pass rushers is a solid move.\n\nGrades:\n\nContract: Four years, $180 million, $100 million total guarantees\n\nThe biggest domino to fall in free agency this year saw the four-time Pro Bowler Cousins head from Minnesota to Atlanta. Cousins is recovering from Achilles surgery but still managed to sign the biggest contract of free agency so far. He stays in the NFC and sees a familiar face at head coach. Raheem Morris and Cousins were in Washington together during Cousins' first three seasons in the league. New Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson will likely run a similar system to what Cousins knew in Minnesota.\n\nIt's a lot of guarantees for a soon-to-be 36-year-old quarterback coming off significant surgery but Cousins will be the best signal-caller Atlanta's had since prime Matt Ryan.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: A\n\nPro Football Focus: A (fit/need); B (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nBleacher Report: A\n\nNeed a quarterback?Think twice as Mac Jones trade stamps 2021 NFL draft as costly warning\n\nContract: Five years, $158.75 million, $95 million total guarantees\n\nJones stays in Kansas City with one of the biggest non-quarterback contracts in NFL history. He's only behind San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa as the highest-paid defenders in the league in average per year (APY). Importantly, he'll be earning a higher APY than Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald by just under $100,000.\n\nYet Bosa turns 27 this coming season and Donald is a three-time Defensive Player of the Year. This is a big deal for a player turning 30 but Jones is arguably the most important player on a championship-winning defense.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B+\n\nPro Football Focus: A+ (fit/need); B (value)\n\nOver the Cap: D\n\nESPN: A\n\nContract: Four years, $110 million, $82.75 million total guarantees\n\nWhen it comes to free agency, there's typically a key reason why players make it to the market instead of re-signing with their teams. Those reasons include injuries, age, drop off production, etc. That is not the case with Wilkins. Per Sports Information Solutions (SIS) Data rankings, Wilkins was the second-best defensive tackle in the NFL last season. He's played more than 1,700 snaps over the last two years and turns 28 this upcoming season. He notched career-highs in sacks (9.0) and quarterback hits (23) in 2023. He'll bring help at a key position for Raiders second-team All-Pro defensive end Maxx Crosby.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: A\n\nPro Football Focus: A+ (fit/need); B (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nBleacher Report: A-\n\nContract (reported): Four years, $92 million, $50 million fully guaranteed\n\nAfter Mike Evans re-signed with Tampa Bay and Tee Higgins was given the franchise tag by Cincinnati, Ridley became the top wideout on the market this offseason. His combination of size (6-foot-1, 190 lbs.), speed, and production set him apart from other wide receivers in the class. He showed out in 2023 against the Titans more than any other team with a combined 13 catches, 209 yards, and three touchdowns against the AFC South foe. Now, he'll suit up for them and bring help to a positional group lacking depth behind DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nRidley turns 30 by the end of the season and, per the figures reported, he will be the ninth-highest paid wide receiver in the NFL by APY. He'll have the second-most guaranteed money at the position behind only Tyreek Hill. That is a lot of money for a player who finished in the bottom quarter of the league among wide receivers and tight ends by SIS Data in 2023.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: C+\n\nPro Football Focus: A (fit/need); C+ (value)\n\nBleacher Report: B+\n\nContract: Three years, $37.75 million, $26 million total guarantees\n\nPhiladelphia's depth chart was thin at running back with three of the Eagles' top four running backs from 2023 all hitting the open market this offseason. They didn't need to look outside their division for an answer, though, and signed the two-time Pro Bowler Barkley. He missed three games in 2023 but totaled 1,242 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns.\n\nIf he stays healthy - Barkley's played 43 of 51 regular season games the last three years - he'll likely become the Eagles' best running back since LeSean McCoy. But this contract makes him the fourth-highest paid running back in the league when, among running backs with at least 150 carries, SIS Data ranked him sixth-worst in the NFL in 2023.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B\n\nPro Football Focus: A (fit/need); B (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nBleacher Report: D+\n\nContract: Four years, $76 million, $42 million total guarantees\n\nThe fourth-year edge rusher had a breakout season in 2023 with the Texans, posting career-highs in sacks (12.5), quarterback hits (22), and tackles for loss (15). He was the top-rated defensive lineman on the Texans per SIS Data and will make it easier for Minnesota to handle losing their top edge rusher from last year (Danielle Hunter) in free agency this offseason. He's solid against the run and the pass and could be an exciting fit in Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores' aggressive system.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B+\n\nPro Football Focus: A+ (fit/need); A- (value)\n\nCBS Sports: B-\n\nBleacher Report: A-\n\nPittsburgh problems?Grabbing Russell Wilson instead of Justin Fields could be costly QB mistake for Steelers\n\nContract: Four years, $48 million, $12.5 million total guarantees\n\nJacobs moves from the Raiders to another storied NFL franchise in Green Bay. He's just one season removed from leading the NFL in rushing yards and earning first-team All-Pro honors in 2022. He played just 13 games in 2023 - tied for the fewest in his five-year career - but still commanded the second-biggest contract among free agent running backs so far. He's the youngest of the top group of running backs on the market this year and will replace Aaron Jones in Green Bay, who signed with the Vikings.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B\n\nPro Football Focus: A (fit/need); B (value)\n\nCBS Sports: B+\n\nBleacher Report: B+\n\nContract: Three years, $41 million, $13.84 million total guarantees\n\nQueen earned Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors in 2023 with the Baltimore Ravens after the best season of his four-year career. SIS Data rated him as one of the best inside linebackers in the league last season. The biggest question is how much his career year was powered by Ravens teammate Roquan Smith, who Baltimore made the highest-paid linebacker in the league in 2022.\n\nQueen stays in the AFC North and goes to division rival Pittsburgh. The Steelers' outside linebackers T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith are a formidable duo and Pittsburgh solidifies that position group even more with Queen, the top inside linebacker on the market.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B-\n\nPro Football Focus: B+ (fit/need); A+ (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nESPN: C+\n\nContract: Two years, $16 million, $9 million total guarantees\n\nThis is the shortest and smallest contract on this list but is one of the most impactful signings on offense so far in free agency. The 30-year-old Henry led the NFL in carries in 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023 and led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns twice (2019 and 2020). But the four-time Pro Bowl running back won't have to carry the ground game in Baltimore like he did in Tennessee. Ravens running back Keaton Mitchell showed lots of speed in his rookie season last year and Lamar Jackson is one of the most dynamic runners in the league. Baltimore tried to get Henry at the trade deadline and instead get him now.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: A-\n\nPro Football Focus: A+++ (fit/need); A (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nESPN: A-\n\nXavier McKinney, S, Green Bay Packers\n\nContract: Four years, $68 million, $25 million total guarantees\n\nMcKinney had a career year in 2023 with the New York Giants by totaling 116 tackles, three interceptions, 11 passes defensed, and two fumble recoveries. He turns 25 during the offseason and his mix of youth, athleticism, and coverage skills made him the top safety in the class. This contract makes him the fourth-highest paid safety in the league by APY.\n\nGreen Bay hired former Boston College head coach Jeff Hafley this offseason to be their new defensive coordinator. His systems in college relied on standout play from the safety position and could use McKinney in multiple ways.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: A\n\nPro Football Focus: A+ (fit/need); B+ (value)\n\nCBS Sports: A\n\nBleacher Report: A-\n\nSam Darnold, QB, Minnesota Vikings\n\nContract: One year, $10 million, $8.75 million total guarantees\n\nThe Vikings couldn't bring back Cousins and ended up signing Darnold, who will turn 27 before the start of the season. Darnold hasn't been a full-time starter since 2021 when he started 11 games for a 5-12 Carolina Panthers squad. In one start last season in Week 18 for the 49ers, Darnold went 16-for-26 passing with 189 yards and two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing). Minnesota has likely the best infrastructure on offense that Darnold's seen as a (presumed) starter.\n\nThis move doesn't stop Minnesota from trading up for a quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft. At $10 million, Darnold is much less expensive than Cousins would have been and can be a bridge while a rookie develops in 2024.\n\nGrades:\n\nUSA Today: B\n\nPro Football Focus: A (fit/need); TBD (value)\n\nCBS Sports: C\n\nESPN: B\n\nNew York receives: Burns\n\nCarolina receives: Second round pick (39th overall) in the 2024 NFL Draft, fifth round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft\n\nContract extension: Five years, $141 million, $87.5 million total guarantees\n\nNew York made the move after Carolina listened to offers for their best defensive player. The Giants then gave Burns a contract making him the second-highest paid edge rusher in the NFL behind Bosa. New defensive coordinator Shane Bowen will now have the duo of Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux, the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, at edge rusher.\n\nIn return, Carolina replenishes some draft capital after trading away top picks last offseason to eventually select Bryce Young first overall in the 2023 NFL Draft.

Mixon had 1,034 yards rushing and 376 yards receiving with 12 total touchdowns last year to lead the Bengals' ground game. He finished 12th among running backs with at least 150 carries in SIS Data rankings. Houston has had just one 1,000-yard rusher in the last seven seasons (Carlos Hyde in 2019). Mixon will fit in with an offense led by defending Offensive Rookie of the Year C.J. Stroud at quarterback.\n\nBengals pivot, trade RB Joe Mixon:What are the grades for the Texans move?\n\nCincinnati signed former Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts running back Zack Moss to shore up the position with Mixon gone.

Likewise, there is a difference between misinformation, in which one is unaware that what is being said is false, versus disinformation which is knowingly false and intended to mislead and sway public opinion,\" Nash said. \"The opinions publicized by Rogan are so dishonest and unsupported by solid facts that Spotify becomes an enabler in a way that costs people their lives.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/10/mothers-day-2024-food-deals/73547851007/", "title": "Mother's Day 2024 food deals, specials for brunch, dining, more", "text": "Here's your reminder: Mother's Day is Sunday, May 12.\n\nIf you don't have a card or gift already picked out or in the mail, you could take mom out to eat on Mother's Day.

Property: If you own property, you can benefit from depreciation, which is how much the value of an asset decreases over time due to use, wear and tear or obsolescence. Depreciation can be deducted from your taxable income every year and is a tactic former President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner famously employed year after year to avoid taxes.\n\nThe IRS allows several types of assets that can be depreciated if used for your business such as personal property like cars, trucks, equipment, furniture or real property that includes buildings or anything else built on or attached to land. Land, though, is never depreciated. In 2023, the maximum expense deduction is $1,160,000 for most property. Residential rental property can be depreciated over 27.5 years and commercial property over 39 years.\n\nHowever, there are different ways to calculate depreciation, some that can be more lucrative in the short-term than others. Here are the basics:\n\nStraight line depreciation: the most commonly used method is calculated by simply dividing the cost of an asset, less its salvage value, by the useful life of the asset. For example, if I purchased a $220,000 building to rent and the building was valued at $200,000 and the land at $20,000. I would then be able to depreciate $200,000 over 27.5 years or $7,272 annually.\n\nCost Segregation Study: when tax experts and engineers study the various components of your building – such as its wiring, plumbing, light fixtures, flooring and exterior improvements – to determine if you can accelerate the depreciation of some of them. For example, HVAC systems, parking lots and carpeting may depreciate faster, say 5, 10, or 15 years or may even be allowed to be fully expensed in the first year. That means big deductions in the first few years and then declining as years pass, a good thing especially if you're not likely to hold a property for 27.5 or 39 years. You can reap most of the tax benefits upfront before selling.\n\nNote: You can't take a depreciation deduction on your personal home, but the tax code includes an exemption for limited renting. It says if a property is rented out for 14 days or less in a calendar year, the income is tax free. \"It started with the Masters Tournaments with golf course homes,\" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at preparer Jackson Hewitt. Resident of Augusta are famous for renting out their properties for the tournament and leaving town for a spring vacation. Some large, nearby luxury homes go for as much as $70,000 per week\n\n\"They rent for 14 days and don’t even have to report it to the IRS,\" said Steber, who notes that this practice has broadened out to luxury ski homes to ocean front properties. Of course, you have to own and live in one of these homes first to do this.\n\n3. Gifting:\n\nAnnual gift tax exclusion . In 2022, the limit was $16,000; in 2023, it’s $17,000 per person. “If you have three kids and 10 grandkids, times two (me and spouse), that’s $34,000 per year to all 13 people that’s out of your estate and a tax-free gift,” said David Handler, Trusts and Estates Practice Group partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\n\n.

Lifetime gift tax exclusion. This is separate from the annual gift. For 2023, it’s $12.92 million ($25.84 million for a married couple), and that amount generally rises each year based on inflation.\n\nNote: The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the lifetime gift tax amount until December 31, 2025. The amount will revert to the pre- amount of $5 million, adjusted for inflation, unless Congress extends the act.\n\n4. Family office: Typically, you need at least $100 million in assets to create a single-family office.\n\nIf properly structured, it can offer personalized services that include investment management, financial planning, estate and tax planning, philanthropic investing and concierge services for family members with all the tax deductions of a business. The stopped individual taxpayers from deducting investment, accounting, tax and similar advisory fees until 2025, but a family office might be able to take them.\n\n“Big wealthy families have the capability to do this if they all agree and get along by making it a business and deducting what would be nondeductible,” said Smith.\n\nBonus: If your kids have skills that can be used in the family office or other business, you can hire them and pay them a hefty salary that’s expensed for the business and passed on to the kids, Smith said.\n\nFamily work:Family businesses: 8 rules for working with your relatives that will keep you on speaking terms\n\nNepo babies:Jamie Lee Curtis, 'OG Nepo Baby,' says the label is designed to 'diminish' and 'hurt'\n\n5. Investments: The average U.S. chief executive salary as of Jan. 26 was $812,100, according to Salary.com. How can that be when we always hear that CEOs earn millions per year?\n\nIn contrast to the 99% who earn most of their income from wages and salaries, the top 1% earn most of their income from investments. From work, they may receive deferred compensation, stock or stock options, and other benefits that aren't taxable right away. Outside of work, they have more investments that might generate interest, dividends, capital gains or, if they own real estate, rent.\n\nReal estate investments, as seen above under property, offer another benefit because they can be depreciated and deducted from federal income tax – another tactic used by wealthy people.\n\nCalculating income:What is income tax?

Changing residency:\n\n“Jake Paul promoted it with a whole new section of the population,” said tax attorney Adam Brewer.\n\nBrothers and social media personalities Jake and Logan Paul moved to Puerto Rico in part to avoid high U.S. taxes.\n\nPuerto Rico is particularly attractive because U.S. citizens who become bona fide Puerto Rican residents – simply relocating doesn’t count – can keep their U.S. citizenship, avoid U.S. federal income tax on capital gains, including U.S.-source capital gains, and avoid paying any income tax on interest and dividends from Puerto Rican sources.\n\nNormally, U.S. taxpayers would have to give up their citizenship or green card to reap federal tax benefits.\n\nTaxing states:State taxes can be complex if you choose to work in a different state. Here's what to know.\n\nTax escape:Want to relocate? What to know about moving to Canada and Mexico\n\nNot everyone’s ready to take that leap, though.\n\n”A lot of people move to avoid state income tax,” Brewer said.\n\nIf you're a big earner, you could benefit from no income tax especially since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped at $10,000 how much state and local taxes you can deduct from your federal taxes through 2025. If Congress doesn’t act to keep this cap, state and local tax deductions will revert to unlimited.\n\nStates without income tax:\n\nAlaska Florida Nevada New Hampshire South Dakota Tennessee Texas Washington Wyoming\n\nCan we get rich people to pay more taxes?\n\nThese are just a handful of ways ultra-wealthy people can legally avoid taxes. Although President Joe Biden proposed a national wealth tax when he took office, that's gone nowhere and now some states are trying to impose their own.\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York and Washington are introducing proposals to tax the rich. Each state has its own approach, but typical strategies include taxing assets and lowering the threshold for estate taxes.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Those agreements helped Google pocket $162 billion in search advertising revenue last year.\n\nAny change to those agreements could have significant consequences for Google.\n\nThe Justice Department's case against Google\n\nThe Justice Department brought the case during the final weeks of the Trump administration. In 2020, the federal government and a number of states filed antitrust charges against Google, alleging it illegally used default agreements with Apple and others to dominate search on the internet.\n\nGoogle captures nearly all – more than 90% – search queries in the U.S., including on mobile devices. Google pays an estimated $18 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple's iOS.\n\n“Two decades ago, Google became the darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy startup with an innovative way to search the emerging internet. That Google is long gone,” the Justice Department said in its initial complaint. “The Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper for the internet, and one of the wealthiest companies on the planet.”\n\nGoogle's defense against antitrust claims\n\nGoogle argues its distribution deals are common in the business world. It pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle.\n\nIf you don’t like Google, you can switch the default search engine on your device, the tech giant argues. But people don’t switch, Google says, because they prefer Google.\n\nGoogle also contends it faces heavy competition from other search engines like Bing and other internet players like Amazon and Yelp.\n\nHow the Google antitrust trial will work\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta – appointed by the Obama administration in 2014 – is presiding over the trial, which will not have a jury.\n\nBank of America outlined four potential outcomes: Google wins the case; the court bans default search deals in the U.S.; the court bans Google default deals but allows others; or the court opens bidding for search deals by region or platform.\n\nWhat has happened so far in the antitrust case\n\nBefore trial, the judge narrowed the scope of the case, dismissing three claims over how Google manages its Android operating system, its relationships with phone makers and its Google Assistant service. He also tossed a claim brought by the states that Google harmed competitors in giving its own products top billing in search results.\n\nLast week, Alphabet and attorneys general in 36 states and Washington, D.C., reached a settlement in an antitrust case over the company’s mobile app store.\n\nTensions between DOJ and Google escalate\n\nGoogle alleged that Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, is biased because of his earlier work in private practice representing Microsoft, News Corp. and Yelp. The Justice Department has accused Google of destroying employees’ chat messages that could have contained relevant information for the case.\n\nWhat's next for Google on the antitrust front\n\nGoogle faces another Justice Department case over its dominance in the digital advertising market, particularly the technology used to place ads.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/09/23/trump-administrations-google-antitrust-action/3511385001/", "title": "DOJ nearing antitrust action on Google; Trump eyes tech curb | AP ...", "text": "Marcy Gordon\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAs the Trump administration moves toward antitrust action against search giant Google, it's campaigning to enlist support from sympathetic state attorneys general across the country.\n\nAnd President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.\n\n\"In recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\" Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \"They've used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\"\n\nFacebook election turnout:Company says it has already registered 2.5 million Americans to vote\n\nTikTok and WeChat ban:How will the move affect users of the apps?\n\nContact tracing:Apple and Google team up to send you notifications if you've been exposed to COVID-19\n\nThe anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.\n\nLawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.\n\nFor over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google's business practices. They cited \"potential monopolistic behavior.\"\n\nNow with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.\n\nAlong with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump's drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.\n\nTrump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.\n\nThe White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \"bad-faith censorship.\"\n\nMore:Fake Facebook pages made in China targeted U.S. presidential election\n\nSocial media platforms can abuse consumers' trust \"by deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\" Barr said.\n\nSeparately, the Justice Department's antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.\n\n\"Big Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\" Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Any effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"\n\nState support\n\nSupport from the states would bolster the Justice Department's case against Google. It's a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action – and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.\n\nSome Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.\n\nThe Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.\n\nThe company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.\n\nA House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech's market dominance. The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.\n\nAntitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.\n\nGoogle, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft's Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.\n\nGoogle also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world's largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.\n\nContributing: Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/tech/meta-ftc-virtual-reality-app-acquisition/index.html", "title": "FTC files to block Facebook-parent Meta from buying a VR company ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday moved to block Facebook-parent Meta from acquiring virtual reality company Within, offering the clearest signal yet that the agency could take a tougher stance on Silicon Valley deals involving newer technologies.\n\nIn a complaint filed Wednesday in federal court, the FTC said Meta has the resources to build its own VR apps similar to those made by Within, the company behind virtual fitness program Supernatural. Instead, the FTC claims, Meta is trying to buy the upstart company, which would “[dampen] future innovation and competitive rivalry.”\n\nThe agency, which is responsible for enforcing US antitrust laws, accused the tech giant of illegally attempting to expand its “virtual reality empire.”\n\nMeta has bet its future on virtual and augmented reality technologies, and the lawsuit comes as the company seeks to build out use cases for its VR headsets. Supernatural is among the most popular apps on Meta’s headset, in some cases turning users on to the idea of exercising in VR for the first time.\n\n“Instead of competing on the merits, Meta is trying to buy its way to the top,” FTC Bureau of Competition Deputy Director John Newman said in a statement Wednesday. “This is an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.”\n\nMeta spokesperson Stephen Peters said in a statement that the FTC’s case is “based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.”\n\n“The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible,” Peters said in the statement. “By attacking this deal in a 3-2 vote, the FTC is sending a chilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR. We are confident that our acquisition of Within will be good for people, developers and the VR space.”\n\nThe FTC alleged in its complaint that the deal would reduce Meta’s incentive to develop its own competitor to Supernatural, or to add new features to Beat Saber, a Meta-owned VR app that the FTC claimed occupies a similar space as a fitness app. Meta, in a blog post responding to the complaint, said Supernatural is not comparable to Beat Saber and thus the deal poses no competitive harm.\n\n“Beat Saber and Supernatural are fundamentally different products with different user bases, different use cases and different competitive dynamics,” Meta said in the blog post. “And this is not just our take – Within’s leadership team strongly believes its competitors are the Pelotons and other established fitness brands of the world, not Beat Saber or other casual VR games.”\n\nMeta is currently battling another FTC antitrust lawsuit that is seeking to break up the tech giant, centering on its years-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC’s action also comes as lawmakers consider legislation that could rein in the power of dominant big tech companies, including Meta.\n\nMeta, then known as Facebook, got its start in VR when it acquired headset maker Oculus in 2014. More recently, it has made a slew of VR-related acquisitions, including game development platform Unit 2 Games and Beat Games, the developer behind Beat Saber. Meta announced its planned acquisition of Within for an undisclosed sum in October 2021.\n\nWithin, a six-year-old VR app developer, released Supernatural in April 2020. Unlike a number of other VR apps, it requires a subscription; rather than simply paying a one-time fee for the app, users must pay $19 per month or $180 per year to keep working out in virtual space.\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC claims that Meta already controls “the top-selling device, a leading app store, seven of the most successful developers, and one of the best-selling apps of all time” in the VR space. The agency pointed to a publicly-reported email Zuckerberg sent to Meta executives in which he is said to have told them it is “critical for the company to also be ‘completely ubiquitous in killer apps,’” referring to apps that will prove the underlying value of new technologies.\n\nThe FTC also notes that Meta already competes in some ways with Supernatural with the Beat Saber app, adding that “the two companies currently spur each other to keep adding new features and attract more users, competitive rivalry that would be lost if this acquisition were allowed to proceed.”\n\nThe FTC’s main argument in the complaint — that the deal would reduce competition by eliminating a competitor — reflects decades of established antitrust thinking, said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the consumer group Public Knowledge and a former FTC antitrust official.\n\n“Under today’s law, that’s usually the strongest legal argument,” Slaiman said. “But I think they are also taking seriously the role of these particular games as a ‘killer app’ for winning the broader metaverse.”\n\nThe complaint plainly recognizes Meta’s potential to dominate the virtual reality space, Slaiman added. “It’s really refreshing to see the FTC is not ‘waiting to see what happens’ in VR.”\n\nSlaiman also said the timing of the FTC’s complaint could renew pressure on Congress to pass a tech-focused antitrust bill that erects new barriers between tech giants’ various lines of business.\n\nThat bill, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, is awaiting a Senate floor vote, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not put the legislation on the agenda and proponents face a shrinking window of time before Congress breaks for summer recess.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Rachel Metz Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Rachel Metz", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/tech/google-loses-eu-fine-appeal/index.html", "title": "Google loses appeal against record $4 billion EU fine | CNN Business", "text": "Google (GOOGL) suffered one of its biggest setbacks on Wednesday when a top European court fined it 4.125 billion euros ($4.13 billion) for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals, offering a precedent for other regulators to ratchet up pressure.\n\nThe unit of US tech giant Alphabet had challenged an earlier ruling, but the decision was broadly upheld by the Europe’s second-highest court in Wednesday’s ruling and the fine was reduced only modestly from 4.34 billion euros ($4.34 billion).\n\nIt is a record fine for an antitrust violation. The European Commission has imposed a total of 8.25 billion euros in antitrust fines on the world’s most popular internet search engine in three investigations stretching back more than a decade.\n\nThis is the second court defeat for Google which lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases.\n\n“The General Court largely confirms the Commission’s decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,” the court said.\n\n“In order better to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement, the General Court considers it appropriate however to impose a fine of 4.125 billion euros on Google, its reasoning differing in certain respects from that of the Commission,” judges said.\n\nGoogle, which can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe’s highest, voiced its disappointment.\n\n“We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full. Android has created more choice for everyone, not less, and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAntitrust boost\n\nThe ruling is a boost for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager following setbacks in cases involving other tech giants such as Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) this year.\n\nVestager has made her crackdown against Big Tech a hallmark of her job, a move which has encouraged regulators in the United States and elsewhere to follow suit.\n\nShe is currently investigating Google’s digital advertising business, its Jedi Blue ad deal with Meta, Apple’s (AAPL) App Store rules, Meta’s marketplace and data use and Amazon’s (AMZN) online selling and market practices.\n\nThe Court agreed with the Commission’s assessment that iPhone maker Apple was not in the same market and therefore could not be a competitive constraint against Android.\n\nThe court backing could strengthen the EU antitrust watchdog in its investigations into Apple’s business practices in the music streaming market where the regulator says the company dominates.\n\nFairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU case, said the judgment will further strengthen Vestager’s landmark tech rules aimed at curbing US tech giants which will go into force next year.\n\n“This victory will embolden the Commission in enforcing its new regulation reigning in Big Tech, the Digital Markets Act,” its lawyer Thomas Vinje said.\n\nThe Commission in its 2018 decision said Google used Android to cement its dominance in general internet search via payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators and restrictions.\n\nGoogle said it acted like countless other businesses and that such payments and agreements help keep Android a free operating system, criticizing the EU decision as out of step with the economic reality of mobile software platforms.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/10/15/google-antitrust-trial-impact-search/71195279007/", "title": "How Google's antitrust trial could change the way you search, more", "text": "Michael Liedtke\n\nAP\n\nIf government regulators prevail against Google in the biggest U.S. antitrust trial in a quarter century, it's likely to unleash drastic changes that will undermine the dominance of a search engine that defines the internet for billions of people.\n\nAs the 10-week trial probing Google's business practices nears its midway point, it's still too early to tell if U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta will side with the Justice Department and try to handcuff one of the world's most dominant tech companies.\n\nIf Mehta rules that Google has been running an illegal monopoly in search, the punishment could open up new online avenues for consumers and businesses to explore in pursuit of information, entertainment and commerce.\n\n“The judge can compel Google to open the floodgates so more startups and third-party competitors can put greater competitive pressure on Google, which will create higher quality online services,” said Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp. The online business review site has been one of Google's harshest critics while spending more than a decade railing against a strategy that favors its own services in search results.\n\nGoogle's search engine earned its huge market share by almost instantaneously presenting people with helpful information culled from the billions of websites that have been indexed since former Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the technology during the late 1990s.\n\nIn addition to its technological wizardry, Google also pays billions of dollars each year to ensure its search engine is the default choice for answering queries entered in the world's most popular smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThese agreements don’t preclude users from switching to a different search engine in their settings, but it’s a tedious process that few people bother to navigate. This reality is why Google is willing to pay so much for the privileged position, according to the Justice Department.\n\nGoogle's payments for preeminent search placement — including an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion per year to Apple alone — are at the head of the Justice Department's case, making it probable the judge would prohibit them if he rules against Google.\n\nShould that happen, experts believe the most likely remedy in the U.S. would be a requirement for smartphones and web browsers to display a palette of different search engines during the setup process. That's something already being done in Europe, where all indications, so far, are that most people are still opting for Google.\n\nThat could be because they believe Google truly is the best search engine — as Google argues in their defense — or they just trust the brand more than rival options such as Microsoft's Bing or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo.\n\nNo more passwords?Google looks to make passwords obsolete with passkeys\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella asserted Google has an almost hypnotic hold on users while testifying earlier this month during the trial.\n\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella said. He then added that the only way to break the habit is by changing the default choice.\n\nAs long as a ruling doesn't exclude Google's rivals from paying to be the automatic search engine on smartphones and web browsers, Microsoft could buy the default position for Bing — an opportunity Nadella indicated he would seize.\n\n“There’s defaults — the only thing that matter in terms of changing search behavior,” Nadella testified.\n\nFlorian Schaub, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, believes the fairest outcome in the trial would an across-the-board ban on all default agreements between two companies.\n\n“The current environment is being shaped by an architecture that's designed by the big companies that control the space,” Schaub said. “What the government can do is inject some neutralism into this and give consumers some actual choices. If people still choose to use Google, that is at least a consumer choice, which would better than having people stick to a default because they are conditioned to that default.”\n\nIn his testimony during the trial, Apple executive Eddy Cue said the company has embraced Google as the preferred search engine on the iPhone and other products because it provides the best experience for its customers. That stance has raised speculation that if Apple is blocked from using Google as the default search engine on the iPhone, it might flex its muscle as the world's richest company to develop its own search technology.\n\nHowever, a blanket ban on default search agreements that have been highly profitable for Apple and other companies such as wireless provider Verizon could trigger unintended consequences, such as raising prices on other popular products.\n\n\"If Google is no longer paying big bucks to Apple and other companies, they might raise the prices for their devices,\" said David Olson, an associate professor for the Boston College Law School who is following the antitrust trial. “I don't think they will be big, but we could see some price increases because Google has essentially been subsidizing the cost of devices like the iPhone.”\n\nAnother offshoot of a ban on default search agreements is that Google still could have a dominant advantage in search if people continue to proactively choose it and the company would have billions of dollars more to spend in other areas that it once devoted to deals that it really didn't need at all.\n\n“Google must think they getting a great benefit from those default agreements, but maybe they're really not worth that much,” Olson said. “Maybe their cost/benefit analysis is off and they will wind up more money and just as much dominance. That would be ironic.”\n\nAlthough the trial is focused on Google's search engine, a government victory could have more sweeping consequences across the technology industry if Mehta decided all default settings are anti-competitive and outlaws all defaults in the settings.\n\n“If one of the outcomes of the trial is that there needs to be more neutral choices, it wouldn't just affect Google on Android phones, it could also affect Apple and the iPhone,” Schaub said. “Does it mean Google phones might have to offer (Apple's virtual assistant) Siri as an alternative to the Google Assistant?

That could raise ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter sparked an international outcry on Thursday by suspending a number of journalists at major news organizations who cover him.\n\nBut a different and possibly related move that Twitter took around the same time, against a fast-growing rival, could open the company up to regulatory scrutiny, some legal experts say.\n\nIn addition to suspending journalists who had been covering a controversy related to the third-party tracking of Musk’s private jet, the platform also suspended the official Twitter account of rival Mastodon after it tweeted about the ElonJet account.\n\nTwitter users began tweeting links to their Mastodon profiles, some half-jokingly telling followers where they could be found on the alternative platform in case they, too, were banned from Twitter without warning.\n\nSoon, however, Twitter began throwing up roadblocks — marking links to Mastodon as “unsafe” and potentially malicious, blocking tweets containing those links and preventing users from adding Mastodon links to their profiles.\n\nNow, legal experts are pondering whether there may be anticompetitive or other regulatory implications arising from Twitter’s blocking of Mastodon links.\n\n“You could see all sorts of problems, both from a competition and a consumer protection standpoint,” said Bill Baer, who has served as the former top antitrust official at the Justice Department and at the Federal Trade Commission across two separate US administrations.\n\nThose questions, which bring to bear on Twitter some of the antitrust scrutiny that’s been leveled at larger tech giants Meta and Google, come just as Twitter faces intensifying questions about its ability to comply with a US government consent decree — along with concerns about hate speech on the platform and the possible precedent set by its suspension of journalists reporting on Musk.\n\nTwitter, which has cut much of its public relations team, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitter’s restrictions on Mastodon\n\nAs news of the journalist suspensions spread, many Twitter users announced they were migrating or expanding to Mastodon. But the sudden restrictions Twitter placed on link-sharing appeared to thwart some attempts at referring users to the alternative platform.\n\n“Twitter is now attempting to prevent its users from navigating to the official social media accounts of elected officials on other platforms,” said Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer, sharing a screenshot of a Twitter system message warning that Beyer’s link to his Mastodon profile was “potentially spammy or unsafe.”\n\nOther users, such as New York Times editor Patrick LaForge, observed that attempts to add Mastodon links to Twitter profiles were producing error messages from Twitter warning that the links were “considered malware.”\n\nCNN confirmed some of the reports with its own testing, finding that Twitter blocked attempts to tweet links referring users to a Mastodon profile. Sharing Mastodon user handles as plain text, and using link-shortening services that obscured the destination URL, allowed users to get around the restrictions. But the link blocking continued into Friday afternoon.\n\nMusk has falsely claimed that the suspended journalists shared real-time information on his physical location, violating Twitter policies. After one of the suspended reporters challenged Musk’s claim in a Twitter Spaces event that Musk spontaneously dropped in on Thursday evening, the new Twitter owner abruptly left the conversation.\n\nEugen Rochko, the founder and CEO of Mastodon, has not publicly addressed Twitter’s link blocking, but has amplified a public report about it. CNN has reached out to Rochko for comment.\n\nA fast-growing rival\n\nWhile there are some differences in how the two platforms operate, Mastodon’s user experience replicates much of the basic Twitter functionality. Twitter is much larger, boasting some 238 million users to Mastodon’s 2.5 million, but the latter has grown rapidly since Musk acquired Twitter. In the first week and a half after Musk closed his Twitter deal, Mastodon gained hundreds of thousands of users, and the migration has only continued since then.\n\nTwitter’s move to block links to a nascent rival could be the type of activity to pique the interest of the Federal Trade Commission, whose chair, Lina Khan, has vowed to crack down on novel ways in which tech platforms might try to hurt competition.\n\nIf regulators could prove Twitter intentionally used the link blocking to preserve a form of market dominance and to keep a potential rival at bay, then they might have a case, legal experts say.\n\nIn general, companies aren’t obligated to do business with each other and can freely choose their business partners. But a dominant firm that’s said to have “market power” can potentially violate antitrust law if they refuse to deal with other parties.\n\nThis notion of a “duty to deal” is likely the most relevant to this situation, according to Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former FTC antitrust official.\n\n“If Twitter has market power, it may have some duties to deal with competitors,” Slaiman said. “Duties to deal is an area of antitrust law that I think is really important in the tech sector, but has been aggressively narrowed” in recent decades.\n\nUnder Khan, a vocal tech skeptic, the FTC has shown an expanded interest in duty-to-deal cases through recent policy statements, Slaiman added. And during the Trump administration, the FTC alleged Facebook had acted anticompetitively by effectively blocking access to Vine, a Twitter-owned video platform, as part of a wider lawsuit seeking to break up the social media giant. (The FTC complaint was later thrown out by a federal judge, but re-filed with slightly different arguments on Khan’s watch.)\n\nA potentially complicated case\n\nA case revolving around duty to deal would likely need to argue that Twitter had harmed itself somehow by restricting Mastodon link-sharing — perhaps by making itself less likely to receive incoming traffic from Mastodon, or by making itself less attractive to advertisers as an open platform. Simultaneously, it would also likely need to show that Twitter’s actions hurt Mastodon even worse, by taking something critical away from it (in this case, potentially, an influx of new users).\n\nBefore that, however, a judge would first have to agree that Twitter enjoys “market power,” or dominance in a specific market that regulators would be expected to describe and explain in any lawsuit. That definition could take a variety of forms, but it would need to pass muster with the judge before prosecutors would even have a shot at arguing that Twitter’s conduct was anticompetitive.\n\nIt could be a tough case, Baer and Slaiman said.\n\nBaer added that Twitter’s link blocking doesn’t just raise potential competition concerns. It also raises questions about Twitter’s stated reasons for blocking the links, and whether those public justifications hold up to scrutiny by consumer protection officials.\n\nAs Beyer tweeted, the link he shared to his own Mastodon profile was not malicious. And prior to Thursday, there did not appear to be grounds for Twitter to claim that Mastodon links were unsafe.\n\nIf Twitter misled the public with its statements about Mastodon links, saying they were spam or malicious when the company knew they were harmless, for example, the FTC could potentially try to argue that Twitter acted unfairly or deceptively, according to Baer.\n\nThe FTC has historically enjoyed broad latitude to prosecute alleged unfair and deceptive business practices. And crucially, those cases don’t require a showing of market power.\n\nWith the FTC already watching Twitter’s behavior closely under Musk, the Mastodon issue may lead to further scrutiny that the company can little afford.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/tech/microsoft-regulators-app-stores/index.html", "title": "Microsoft tries to win over regulators for massive Activision Blizzard ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is trying to persuade regulators to approve its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) with a series of new app store commitments that it says will put the company “on the right side of history” as policymakers worldwide debate new laws to force competition open in digital marketplaces.\n\nThe 11-point pledge, announced Wednesday, includes promises by Microsoftto allow third-party app stores on its platforms and to not give preferential treatment to its own published games on the digital marketplaces the company runs. Microsoft also committed to letting software developers use whichever payment system they prefer rather than require that they use Microsoft’s proprietary channels.\n\nThe pledge covers not just the Activision Blizzard deal but virtually all of Microsoft’s gaming business going forward, including metaverse platforms, CEO Satya Nadella and President Brad Smith told reporters during a visit to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s pitch to antitrust regulators to bless the Activision Blizzard merger — the largest in the company’s history. The deal focuses antitrust scrutiny on a tech giant that has so far avoided much of the criticism and skepticism that has been leveled in recent years at other Silicon Valley behemoths including Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG).\n\nIt also reflects an effort by Microsoft to get ahead of legislation that targets the largest app store operators.\n\n“We want to compete. We want to compete for users; we want to compete for publishers,” Nadella told reporters. “I want us to approach this in a principled way where we are building our platforms, our technology, such that we are on the right side of history.”\n\nThe announcement comes amid a global reckoning for app stores, as software developers have revolted against what they say are high store fees and draconian policies that harm consumers. Those tensions have culminated most visibly in a lawsuit by Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” against Apple — litigation that Microsoft has supported with a friend-of-the-court filing staking out positions against the iPhone maker.\n\nAs part of Wednesday’s pledge, Microsoft vowed that video games produced under its own banner — including titles it plans to acquire from Activision Blizzard such as “Call of Duty” — will not be given preferential treatment on its app stores relative to competing games. It also said it would not use data collected from app store activity to compete with developers. And it added that Microsoft would not stand in the way of app makers contacting their users directly with information about prices or product offerings.\n\nThose commitments reflect a sharp contrast from policies and practices of some other tech giants that have come under fire. A key complaint against Google, for example, is that it has ranked or prioritized its own apps and services higher in search results. Apple and Google have lobbied hard against Congressional legislation to force open US app stores, saying that the new proposed rules could harm user security. (On Wednesday, Microsoft said that apps on its platform would still need to undergo “reasonable” security reviews.)\n\nSeparately, Microsoft said it has committed to Sony that popular franchises it acquires from Activision Blizzard will remain available on PlayStation under Activision’s existing deal with Sony, and that it has offered to extend the deal on a “multiyear basis.” The existing deal with Sony runs until 2024, Smith said.\n\nThe commitments will take effect immediately on Microsoft’s Windows store, said Smith, while a smaller subset will apply initially to the Xbox store before expanding to include all of the 11 principles. All of the principles will also apply immediately upon the launch of a forthcoming app store Microsoft is developing, which execs dubbed a “universal store.”\n\n“This store will enable people to connect across all devices, globally,” said Sarah Bond, a top Xbox executive.\n\nTrying to get ahead of scrutiny\n\nThe historic merger comes as regulators worldwide are rethinking how to apply competition laws to the digital world. Just a few years ago, the Activision Blizzard deal would not have attracted much scrutiny, Smith said, who added that the acquisition will make Microsoft the third largest game publisher in the world after Tencent and Sony.\n\n“Regulators don’t typically get all that concerned about a company becoming number three,” Smith said. “But we’re not in the world of 2018 or 2019, it’s 2022. And we recognize there will be more scrutiny of any large acquisition that is being made by a large tech company. So I think that it really behooves us to step forward quickly and proactively and be very transparent about how we will manage this business, with a clear eye toward the competition law issues and responsibilities that we have.”\n\nIn addition to the deal’s impact on video game players and app stores, regulators could analyze the merger’s effect on competition in labor markets, Nadella acknowledged — an area where US regulators have shown increasing interest. That may prove particularly relevant in light of recent reports of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace at Activision Blizzard, a crisis that Nadella said Microsoft may look to address once Activision Blizzard follows through on its existing public commitments on the matter.\n\nNadella argued the merger is pro-competitive from a labor perspective because Microsoft “is a preferred employer” among people who work in games.\n\n“So if you even want to take a much broader view and say, ‘What does it do to people who are employed in the gaming industry?’” he said, “I think Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and our commitment to people who work in the gaming industry, is another element that will serve us well as we go through the review process everywhere in the world.”\n\nLast week, Microsoft filed formal paperwork with the Federal Trade Commission to kickstart the merger review process, and has delivered an initial briefing to FTC staff, Smith said.\n\nWednesday’s commitments will be implemented regardless of whether the Activision Blizzard deal closes or whether governments worldwide succeed in passing app store legislation, said Smith.\n\n“This will be the right thing for gamers and our employees, and it is a clear message to regulators we’re leaning in and adapting to the kinds of issues they want to address,” Smith said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/business/ticketmaster-taylor-swift-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "More than two dozen Taylor Swift fans sue Ticketmaster | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDon’t mess with Swifties.\n\nMore than two dozen Taylor Swift fans are suing Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. for “unlawful conduct” in the pop star’s chaotic tour sale, claiming the ticketing giant violated antitrust laws, among others.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in a California courton Friday, alleges Ticketmaster and its parent company were anti-competitive, imposing higher prices on fans in the presale, sale and resale market. It claims Ticketmaster forces concertgoers to exclusively use its site and controlled all registration and access to Swift’s “The Eras Tour.”\n\nThe Swifties are seeking a penalty of $2,500 for each violation, which could add up, based on the millions of angered fans who did not receive tickets.\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that since Ticketmasterhas agreements with the large stadiums in the tour, Swift “has no choice” but to work with Ticketmaster due to the size of her fan base. It also alleges that Ticketmaster profits off the resale of tickets in the secondary market by adding a service fee to its fan-to-fan exchange.\n\n“Ticketmaster is a monopoly that is only interested in taking every dollar it can from a captive public,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nPre-sale tickets for “The Eras Tour” frustrated Swift fans across the country in a debacle that stayed in the headlines for weeks. In November, “Verified Fans” were sent a presale code — but when sales began, heavy demand snarled the website and millions of Swifties could not get their hands on a ticket. Presale tickets for Capital One card holders brought similar frustration — and then Ticketmaster canceled sales to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demand” and “insufficient remaining ticket inventory.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the company “intentionally and purposely mislead TaylorSwiftTix presale ticket holders by providing codes to 1.4 million ‘verified fans,’” despite the shortage of seats. Ticketmaster said more than two million tickets were sold on the first day of sales for her upcoming tour — the most ever sold for an artist in a single day.\n\n“Millions of fans waited up to eight hours and were unable to purchase tickets as a result of insufficient ticket releases,” the lawsuit said. “Ticketmaster intentionally provided codes when it could not satisfy demands.”\n\nThe 26 Swifties suing the ticketing company are located across the country, from Utah to North Carolina. CNN has reached out to Ticketmaster for comment. Jennifer Kinder, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the case, said it is waiting acceptance by the clerk.\n\nTaylor Swift spoke out in a heartfelt post about the ticketing “mistakes,” writing on Instagram that there were a “multitude of reasons why people had such a hard time” getting tickets, and said the experience was “excruciating” for her to watch.\n\nIn a blog postthat has since been taken down, Ticketmaster said its “Verified Fans” system, a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots by giving presale codes to individuals, couldn’t keep up with the intense demand. Roughly 3.5 million people signed up for the program to buy Swift tickets, its “largest registration in history.” That unprecedented demand, combined with a “staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes” drove “unprecedented traffic” to its site, Ticketmaster said, and, essentially, broke it.\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Swift and her fans for the “terrible experience” some had trying to purchase tickets and said it would work to “shore up our tech for the new bar that has been set by demand” for Swift’s tour.\n\nThe ticketing debacle drew the ire of several lawmakers, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, who wrotean open letter to Ticketmaster’s CEO, saying she has “serious concerns” about the company’s operations.\n\nIn addition, the Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into Live Nation, a source told CNN, to determine whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing.\n\nLive Nation responded Saturday in a statement posted to its website, saying it “takes its responsibilities under the antitrust laws seriously” and “does not engage in behaviors that could justify antitrust litigation, let alone orders that would require it to alter fundamental business practices.”\n\n– CNN’s Frank Pallotta and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/business/china-stock-us-delisting-averted-audit-access-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Stock delisting risks averted as US gains access to audit papers of ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nUS regulators have gained full access to the audits of Chinese companies for the first time, reducing thethreat that tech giants such as Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) couldbe kicked off US stock exchanges.\n\nThe announcement marks a major breakthrough ina yearslong standoff over how Chinese companies listed on Wall Street should be regulated.

Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, was bearing the brunt of the cyclone's fury.\n\nTelevision footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.\n\nFour districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people — Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari — were likely to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages.\n\nAt least two people were killed in the cyclone — one when a wall collapsed in Visakhapatnam, and the other when a tree toppled over in Srikakulam.\n\nAndhra Pradesh's chief minister, N.

The fire, which remains 0% contained as of Monday morning, has charred more than 15,000 acres in central California’s Mariposa County, officials said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the region, which frees additional resources to battle the fire. About 2,500 personnel are working to help extinguish the blaze, which has been burning since Friday and has destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged five others. The wildfire comes as much of the US has been experiencing sweltering heat and worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nRussian missile strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port of Odesa, just one day after Ukraine and Russia agreed on a deal that would allow the resumption of vital grain exports from the region. “Russia agreed to some deal on grain export, but immediately after this attacked it – showing they want to continue to threaten the world’s food security,” Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. The deal promised to unblock ports on the Black Sea to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds – some of Ukraine’s most important exports. Russia has been blocking maritime access to those ports, meaning that millions of tons of Ukrainian grain have not reached the many countries that rely on the food source. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s missile attack “casts serious doubt” on the grain deal. The US is now working with Ukraine on a “Plan B” to get grain exports out of the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows Russian missile hitting Odesa harbor 01:55 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Monkeypox\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. This comes as the US is reporting more than 2,800 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 44 states, DC and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC. Two of the cases have been identified in children. Globally, more than 16,500 cases have been reported so far in 74 countries. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of disease. Although monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease, it spreads through skin-to-skin contact.

Japan volcano\n\nA volcano in Japan erupted on Sunday, prompting a Level 5 alert – the highest level – calling for people to evacuate. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the country’s Sakurajima volcano, located on the island of Kyushu, erupted around 8:05 p.m. local time (7:05 a.m. ET). Footage from the agency’s surveillance camera showed a cloud of smoke or ash rising from the volcano. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. According to NASA, Sakurajima is one of Japan’s most active volcanoes, having erupted on several occasions in recent decades. The volcano is located in the Kagoshima Prefecture on the southern tip of Japan.\n\n5. 2024 election\n\nA growing number of Republicans are openly cheering for a competitive primary field in 2024 and encouraging presidential candidates to jump into the race. This comes as some in the GOP are getting anxious about the idea of Donald Trump becoming their nominee again – especially amid damning revelations about his actions during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. While Trump still maintains more support among Republicans than any other would-be challenger, GOP leaders who want to steer the party in a new direction said they are worried Trump’s potential legal woes and political baggage could drag down the party in 2024. As former Vice President Mike Pence continues to distance himself from his old boss, Trump is reportedly itching to announce his 2024 presidential campaign. Separately, the New York Post – a popular tabloid among Trump voters – published an editorial this weekend saying Trump is “unworthy to be this country’s chief executive again.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Stunning turnaround': GOP strategist explains Jan. 6 hearings' effect on Trump voters 01:37 - Source: CNN\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nStunning video shows diver’s close call with massive great white shark\n\nFor those who dream of going shark diving… chews wisely.

Steinhardt had bought the looted items, including statues and ceremonial vessels, without seeing evidence of their ownership history, investigators said.

Follow here for the latest updates on the attack in Kyiv on Saturday, Feb. 26.\n\n***\n\nRussian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had vowed defiance through the night.\n\n\"We must survive this night,” Zelenskyy – who told Ukrainians earlier that Russia has marked him as “target No. 1” – said in a video message before morning arrived in Kyiv.\n\nAs Saturday began, Zelenskyy tweeted that he had started “a new day on the diplomatic frontline” with a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, with “weapons and equipment from our partners” on the way.\n\nBut the danger remained far from over to the former Soviet republic. Photos from Ukraine detailed destruction by Russian troops and bombs, with Ukrainian citizens huddled in underground bomb shelters or trying to flee their country to safety, carrying family members and what possessions they could. Authorities in Kyiv described fighting in the streets and urged residents to seek shelter.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden was slated to meet with his national security team on Saturday morning; the U.S. and other nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and on its president, Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that the economic price will force Russia from its current path.\n\nZelenskyy government:What happens if Kyiv falls? What would a government in exile look like?\n\nDawn breaks in Kyiv\n\nAs dawn broke in Kyiv, it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.\n\nBut the swift movement of the troops after less than three days of fighting further imperiled a country clinging to independence in the face of a broad Russian assault, which threatened to topple the democratic government and scramble the post-Cold War world order.\n\nThe street clashes followed fighting that pummeled bridges, schools and apartment buildings, and resulted in hundreds of casualties.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nDelta ends Russian partnership\n\nDelta has withdrawn its codeshare services operated in conjunction with Russian national airline, Aeroflot, effective immediately. Codeshare allows one airline to sell seats on flights operated by other airlines\n\n\"We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot’s code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK,\" Delta said in a statement.\n\nDelta does not operate services to Ukraine or Russia.\n\n-- Craig Harris\n\nUS Dept of State warns Americans in Russia to stay away from protests\n\nThe U.S. Department of State early on Saturday warned Americans in Russia to “avoid demonstrations and any demonstration-related activities” because of the possibility of widespread arrests.\n\n“According to social media sources, there have been calls for demonstrations throughout Russia, including in major cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, in opposition to the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces against Ukraine,” the State Department noted in an online alert.\n\n“The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens that the Department of State’s Travel Advisory level for Russia is at “Level 4: Do Not Travel” for reasons including harassment against U.S. citizens, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law,” the statement added.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nZelenskyy and Macron speak\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted early Saturday morning that he and French President Emmanuel Macron had spoken by phone.\n\n\"A new day on the diplomatic frontline began with a conversation with @EmmanuelMacron. Weapons and equipment from our partners are on the way to Ukraine. The anti-war coalition is working!\" Zelenskyy tweeted.\n\n-- Luciana Lopez\n\nBlinken, South Korea foreign minister speak\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday to discuss the two allies’ cooperation over the Russia-Ukraine crisis, including Seoul’s participation in a U.S.-led economic pressure campaign against Moscow.\n\nSeoul’s Foreign Ministry said Chung and Blinken reaffirmed the allies’ “strong condemnation” of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and they urged Russia to immediately cease its takeover attempt.\n\nBlinken thanked South Korea for its support of Ukraine and its willingness to participate in international sanctions against Russia, the ministry said.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBetter trained, better equipped:What you should know about Russia and Ukraine's militaries\n\n'I need ammunition, not a ride'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer.\n\nZelenskyy said in response: “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, who described Zelenskyy as upbeat.\n\nInvading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine’s capital on Saturday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's actor president, prepares for his greatest role yet\n\nSecond Russian transport plane shot down\n\nA second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine’s military said it had shot down a Russian military transport plane with paratroopers on board.\n\nAccording to a statement from the military’s General Staff, the first Il-76 heavy transport plane was shot down near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles south of Kyiv. The Russian military has not commented on either incident so far, and the reports could not be immediately verified.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nFighting in the streets of Kyiv\n\nKyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is underway against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter.\n\nThe warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nPresident refuses to flee, urges Ukraine to 'stand firm'\n\nRussian troops stormed toward Ukraine’s capital early Saturday as explosions reverberated through the city and the president urged the country to “stand firm” against the siege that could determine its future. He refused American help to evacuate, saying: “The fight is here.”\n\nHundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which U.S. officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objective.\n\nThe assault represented Putin's boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin.\n\nAs his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.\n\n“This night we have to stand firm,” he said. \"The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”\n\n'Hands off Ukraine!' Russian protesters, celebrities risk arrest to denounce Putin's war\n\nZelenskyy was urged to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation. The official quoted the president as saying that “the fight is here\" and that he needed anti-tank ammunition but “not a ride.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nBattle for Ukrainian capital reportedly intensifying, with explosions seen and heard in Kyiv\n\nRussian forces have reportedly moved in closer to Kyiv early Saturday morning, and explosions were seen and heard in parts of the capital suggesting an escalation of fighting with Ukrainian defenders, according to CNN.\n\nThe cable network reported that operations by Ukrainian forces to repel the Russian advance were intensifying in the early morning hours of Saturday, Kyiv time, not long after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy warned that the battle could be over by morning.\n\n\"This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy said in a late-night video message Friday that was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n\"This night we have to stand ground,” Zelenskyy said, surrounded by members of his national security team. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"\n\nCNN teams in the capital reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city. And Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes were underway in an eastern suburb as Russian forces appeared to be closing in on Kyiv from at least three sides.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning, the State Service of Special Communications reported: “Explosions in Kyiv. What is known? The enemy is trying to attack CHP-6 near Troieschyna. The Armed Forces give battle. Resistance continues in Vasylkiv, where enemy troops are trying to land.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\n'It is at its worst tonight'\n\nKonstantin Novikov is a yoga teacher living outside of Kyiv who is one of several residents who shared what life has been like the past few days. shared his Friday.\n\n\"They just started shooting. It's scary, you don't know where it's going to go.\n\n10 min ago there was a lot (of shooting); many rockets . It's silent now, and we are waiting. We will go down with a neighbor to the entrance to the first floor and we will sit there. It seems safer.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I have my car downstairs full of gas. I put my documents, money and some stuff in a little bag. In any moment i can take my bags, my cats, and run away if it is too scary to stay. ... Maybe I will go to the center of Ukraine. Somewhere where it is more safe. Mostly people are going to western Ukraine like Lviv. But right now I can only go through Kyiv because it is blocked any other way. Either by Russian troops on one side, or (on another road) the bridge was blown up to keep Russian troops from going over the road to Kyiv. So, I have only one way out from my city.\"\n\nUnclear if Japan to join in Russia sanctions\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi says he spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the phone Saturday and agreed they must respond to Russian invasion of Ukraine properly to prevent it from becoming “a wrong lesson” because of its potential influence in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nHayashi declined to comment if Japan plans to join the United States, Britain and the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said Japan will closely stay in touch with other Group of Seven members and the international society while watching the development.\n\nUkrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nHayashi told reporters that he and Blinken reassured their commitment to work closely with the rest of the international society. They agreed that it is necessary to respond to Russia properly and to absolutely reject the unilateral act to change the status quo and not leave “a wrong lesson.”\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussian troops march on\n\nThe Russian military said Friday it had encircled the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine, but was “taking steps to ensure civilians’ safety.”\n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have so far knocked out 211 Ukrainian military installations, including 17 command centers, 19 air defense missile systems, 39 radar units, 67 tanks and six warplanes. The Russian military also said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.\n\nLate Friday, the Russian military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city near the Azov Sea. The claim could not immediately be independently verified.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said it’s estimated that Russia has now launched more than 200 missiles into Ukraine and some have hit residential areas, although it was unclear if they were deliberately targeted.\n\nBut U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.\n\n\"We must survive this night”\n\nThe U.S. and its European allies moved to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday as Russia's military pushed further into Ukraine in an invasion that threatened to topple its democratic government.\n\nThe White House announced the new sanctions after President Joe Biden met with fellow NATO heads of state to discuss the mounting crisis.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures. Bridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building.\n\nAs Russian troops neared the capital, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to stay and fight - and beckoned his fellow countrymen to do the same.\n\n“You can not give up the capital,\" he said in a video message. \"We must survive this night.”\n\nThe crisis has roiled the globe since Putin, in the pre-dawn hours of Moscow on Thursday, announced in a televised address that he was launching a military operation against Ukraine.\n\nInternational backlash followed swiftly, with sanctions by the United States and a host of other countries. Biden said the new economic measures would \"limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.\"\n\nBut, so far, those sanctions appear to have had little effect on Russia's attempt to take over the one-time Soviet Republic that has expressed a desire to someday join NATO.\n\n• MOUNTING DEATH TOLL: Zelenskyy announced that 137 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed with hundreds more wounded.\n\n• WHERE IS THE FIGHTING?

Here's what we know\n\nA NEW COLD WAR?: How historians view Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nRussia vetoes UN Security Council resolution that it stop attacking Ukraine; China abstains\n\nAs expected, Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Friday evening demanding that Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine immediately and withdraw all troops. U.S. officials said they knew Moscow would oppose the measure but that they wanted to highlight Russia’s isolation within the international community.\n\nThe vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained.\n\nThe vote was delayed for two hours as the United States and Albania, co-sponsor of the resolution, worked behind the scenes to shore up support for the resolution among wavering nations, including Brazil.\n\n“A line has been crossed, and this council cannot remain silent,” said Brazil’s Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho. He said his government was “gravely concerned” about Russia’s military action.\n\nChina’s decision to abstain was seen as a diplomatic victory for pro-Ukrainian forces, given its history of using its veto power alongside ally Russia.\n\n-- Josh Meyer and Associated Press\n\nRussia-Ukraine explained:Inside the crisis as US calls Russian movements an invasion\n\nUkrainian President vows to stay and fight advancing Russian troops in Kyiv\n\nAs Russian troops advanced on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv Friday evening, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a video statement that multiple cities were under attack and intent on seizing the capitol.\n\n”The night will be harder than the day,” Zelenskyy said on the video, which was widely circulated on Twitter.\n\n“At night they will storm,” he said in the message to Ukrainians. “You can not give up the capital. We must survive this night.”\n\nBiden administration spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed Friday afternoon that U.S. officials believe Putin intends to try to take the capital and oust the government.\n\nThe explosions and gunfire in Kyiv fueled further fears of wider war in Europe and triggered new international efforts — including direct sanctions on President Vladimir Putin by the U.S., UK, European Union and Canada — to make Moscow stop.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nU.S. to sanction Putin, other Russian officials\n\nThe United States is slapping sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and some of his deputies in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the new sanctions will target Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and members of Russia’s national security team.\n\nThe announcement follows a decision by the European Union earlier Friday to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, along with other sanctions.\n\nThe United States already has hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\n--Michael Collins and Joey Garrison\n\nThe enigma of Vladimir Putin:What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nUkraine's ambassador to US: Very concerned about Chernobyl\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., voiced concern Friday that Russia took control of the Chernobyl power plant – site of the worst nuclear disaster in history – and took 92 staff members as hostages.\n\n“We are very concerned that the Chernobyl shelter is under threat of any type of random attack by the Russian federation,” Markarova told reporters in Washington.\n\nMore broadly, she said Ukraine armed forces destroyed 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes, seven helicopters and 516 armored vehicles. She blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for casualties.\n\n“As a result of Mr. Putin’s decision to send Russians to kill Ukrainians, 2,800 of Russian soldiers will not be going back to Russia,” she said.\n\nMarkarova said she wasn’t able to say what it would take for Putin to abandon the attack, but that Ukraine sought territorial integrity not just of its eastern provinces, but also Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n“We are ready for peace talks, but we are not ready for capitulation or surrender,” Markarova said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWarner warns tech companies about Russian disinformation efforts\n\nSen. Mark Warner is urging U.S. tech companies on Friday not to let their platforms be misused by Russian influence operations in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, sent letters Friday to Alphabet, Meta – formerly known as Google and Facebook – as well as Reddit, Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter alerting them to malicious “information warfare” activities by Russia and Russia-linked entities.\n\n“As this conflict continues, we can expect to see an escalation in Russia’s use of both overt and covert means to sow confusion about the conflict and promote disinformation narratives that weaken the global response to these illegal acts,” Warner wrote.\n\nIn his letter to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Warner said his staff observed YouTube ads on Thursday monetizing content regarding the conflict in Ukraine from RT, Sputnik and TASS, which he described as malign actors affiliated with the Russian government.\n\n“Unfortunately, your platforms continue to be key vectors for malign actors – including, notably, those affiliated with the Russian government – to not only spread disinformation, but to profit from it,” Warner said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nHundreds of casualties reported amid bombing damage, destruction\n\nAs the fighting intensified in Ukraine Friday, government officials offered competing assessments of the death toll.\n\nUkrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.\n\nU.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.\n\nBridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building. After 8 p.m. in Ukraine, a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of the protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president.

He had prolonged exposure in December to another prisoner with tuberculosis and was coughing up blood, according to U.S. embassy spokesman Jason Rebholz. Trevor Reed had been diagnosed with COVID-19 last May.\n\nAs a Marine, Reed served as a presidential guard and provided security at Camp David during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Reed was arrested in Moscow in August 2019 after allegedly being involved in a drunken fight at a party. He’s serving a nine-year sentence on charges the U.S. ambassador called “absurd.” U.S. officials have said Reed and another former Marine, Paul Whelan, were imprisoned potentially to be used as bargaining chips for the release of Russian spies.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday diplomatic talks with Russia have been ruptured by Moscow's massive military attack on Ukraine.\n\nPaula Reed told the Dallas Morning News the remarks were “like the exclamation point” to know “it’s going to be that much more difficult to get Trevor home.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nUkrainian minister offers pay hike for soldiers\n\nUkraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced Friday that the country’s armed forces would receive a 30% salary increase, along with monthly bonuses, while Ukraine is battling a Russian invasion that threatens its survival as a free democracy.\n\n“Together with the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance and the relevant parliamentary committee, we managed to find the expected financial resources and raise the salaries of Ukrainian defenders to the national average,” Reznikov said in a statement. “This is only the first step.

Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.\n\nIn response, the European Union agreed Friday to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy posts video pledging continued defense\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a short video just after midnight local time with other leaders of his country proclaiming their continued defense against the Russian invasion.\n\nHis defiance came as Russian troops pushed toward the capital Kyiv, and as questions swirled on social media about whether leaders had begun fleeing.\n\n“We are all here,” said Zelenskyy, who was surrounded by a handful of leaders. “Our military is here, citizens are here. We are all here defending our independence, our state and it will be so further. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nHe was joined by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and adviser Mykhailo Podoliak among other officials.\n\n\"Glory to heroes!\" the men said as the video ended.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Karina Zaiets\n\n'We are all here' Ukrainian President Zelenskyy shares message from Kyiv\n\nEU to freeze assets on Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov - Latvian official\n\nThe European Union agreed to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions, according to Latvia's foreign minister.\n\nThe move is intended to ratchet up financial pressure on Putin to back off Ukraine and would add to other sanctions levied against Moscow from governments including the United States.\n\nLatvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said in a tweet on Friday that the EU's foreign ministers “adopted the 2nd sanctions package” and added that “the asset freeze includes President of Russia and its Foreign Minister.”\n\nHe said the EU plans to prepare another package of sanctions.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nUS official: Russian forces advance but not as quickly as anticipated\n\nRussian forces continue to invade Ukraine along three routes, including from the north toward Kyiv, although a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Russian momentum toward Kyiv has slowed in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe U.S. official declined to say how many Russian troops were on the ground in Ukraine now, but estimated it was about one third of the combat force that Russia had massed before the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin had deployed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border prior to the invasion.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, told reporters Friday the U.S. had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Ukraine's capital. The official declined to say how the Pentagon had made that assessment, but Russia has not yet captured any major population centers.\n\nRussia has failed to dominate Ukrainian air space, the official said. Ukraine continues to fly warplanes that are attacking Russian forces. Ukraine also retains missiles for air defense.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, the Russians have made an amphibious attack, landing thousands of troops, the official said.\n\nElsewhere in the south, a battle is being fought for the Kakhovka hyrdo-electric plant that provides energy to Crimea and southern Ukraine. Russia has launched cyberattacks there, the official said.\n\n-Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUkraine pressures Europe to ban Russia from SWIFT\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister ramped up the pressure on European leaders on Friday to kick Russia out of the SWIFT financial system in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe United States and Europe already have hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But some European leaders have been reluctant to boot Russia from SWIFT, a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.\n\nUkraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to Twitter to urge those holdouts to reconsider, citing their past statements that a conflict like World War II should never be allowed to happen again.\n\n“To some European leaders who are still hesitant: each year at commemorative events you say ‘Never again,’” he wrote. “The time to prove it is now. Russia is waging a horrific war of aggression in Europe. Here is your ‘never again’ test: BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere.”\n\nKuleba said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the need for the U.S. to use its influence to persuade hesitant European leaders to ban Russia from SWIFT.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nZelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting Russia ‘alone’\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday Ukraine is fighting Russia “alone,” in an apparent criticism of the U.S. and other western allies, as he pushes for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion of his country.\n\n“This morning, we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday,” he said in an address to Ukrainians. “The world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday’s sanctions convince Russia?”\n\nBiden has vowed that he won’t send U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, though he has sent American forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank.\n\nBiden announced a second round of U.S. sanctions announced Thursday, but it did not include the harsh step of cutting Russia from the SWIFT financial system, which connects banks worldwide.\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nKremlin open to talks if Ukraine stops fighting\n\nThe Kremlin said Friday it is ready to hold talks with Ukrainian officials, but only after Ukrainian forces stand down. The conditional offer came as Russian forces bore down on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation to Belarus to meet with Ukrainian officials. This came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is willing to discuss a non-aligned status for the country, which would essentially mean dropping the country's bid to join NATO.\n\nHowever, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine must put down its arms before any talks happen, according to Russia's state controlled TASS News Agency.\n\nCharting Russia's invasion in maps\n\nRussian military forces invaded Ukraine at roughly 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday (4:30 a.m. on Thursday in Ukraine), using missiles, troops, tanks and aircraft.\n\nThe invasion has targeted major cities and military sites, with the attacks coming from all different directions, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Russia has fired more than 100 missiles.\n\nSee where Russia's forces are moving\n\nEmergency spending for Ukraine likely to reach billions, US senator says\n\nCongress may need to approve at least $10 billion in emergency spending to support Ukraine and for other needs, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Friday.\n\nCoons, a close ally of President Joe Biden who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters his estimate may be on the low side because it doesn’t include what may be a “robust” request from the Pentagon.\n\n“There is strong enthusiasm to provide ongoing resupply and training and whatever other covert and overt support is necessary and appropriate for the Ukrainian resistance,” he said.\n\nCoons, who also heads a subcommittee in charge of humanitarian aid, said he’s confident billions of dollars will be needed to support the likely millions of refugees expected to flee Ukraine for nearby countries.\n\n“It would be a wild guess on my part,” he said, “but I would be supportive of an emergency supplemental of at least $10 billion, perhaps more, to meet these vital national security and humanitarian needs.”\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nUkrainian official: Kyiv residents should make Molotov cocktails\n\nUkraine's Defense Ministry urged Kyiv's residents Friday to stay inside and prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their capital as Russian troops and tanks were on the verge of entering the central part of the city for the first since President Vladimir Putin launched his assault on Ukraine.\n\n\"Neutralize the enemy,\" Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted as Kyiv continued to be hit by apparent Russian airstrikes that have damaged apartment buildings and forced thousands into bomb shelters. Air raid sirens rang out through the night and into the early morning.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is continuing to plead with western leaders to unveil harsher sanctions on the Kremlin, saying “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”\n\nUkraine claims that more than 1,000 Russian troops have already been killed, though British officials have put the Russian death toll at half that.\n\n-Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from it impact the country?\n\nPresident Biden on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut one move the president didn’t announce: kicking Russia out of the SWIFT financial system.\n\nBiden said removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial system is still on the table but that European allies had resisted that step. The SWIFT system shifts money between banks around the world. Removing Russia would block Moscow from most international financial transactions, including profits from oil and gas production that are the lifeblood of Russia’s economy.\n\nMore:What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from the banking system impact the country?\n\nRussia bans British flights from airspace\n\nRussia’s civil aviation authority has banned U.K. flights to and over Russia in retaliation against the British government’s ban on Aeroflot flights.\n\nRosaviatsiya said that all flights by the U.K. carriers to Russia as well as transit flights are banned starting Friday.\n\nIt said the measure was taken in response to the “unfriendly decisions” by the British authorities who banned flights to the U.K. by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nPope Francis makes unprecedented visit to Russian embassy\n\nPope Francis went to the Russian embassy in Rome on Friday to personally express his concern about the war in Ukraine, in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent.\n\nPopes usually receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican. For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of concern about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nVatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted “clearly to express his concern about the war.” Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said.\n\nFrancis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine.\n\nBut he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties.\n\nRockets strike Kyiv in `horrific’ attack\n\nRussia has launched a “horrific” rocket strike on Kyiv, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted Friday.\n\nThe capital hasn’t experienced an attack like that since 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded, he said.\n\n“Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one,” Kuleba tweeted. “Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out\" of everywhere.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nRussian invasion advances on Kyiv; civilians spent night in bomb shelters\n\nRussian troops appeared to be advancing on Kyiv at the start of the second day of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAmid a fast-moving and difficult-to-verify situation, Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted early Friday that some Russian troops had broken through to several northern districts on the outskirts of the capital. However, Ukraine's military also said it was resisting the advance on multiple fronts.\n\nThe apparent development comes as thousands of civilians spent the night in bomb shelters, typically underground subway stations, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his citizens to do all they can to resist Russia's assault. Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv with his family and he appealed to Russia for a ceasefire.\n\nSome 137 Ukrainians, a mixture of soldiers and civilians, died in the fighting on Thursday, Zelenskyy said. Britain's Defense Secretary told his country's media Friday that Russia has lost about 450 military personnel.\n\nThe U.S., Europe and Japan have all unveiled sanctions on key Russian banks, airlines and associates of President Vladimir Putin. Later Friday, NATO leaders will convene an emergency meeting by video link to discuss the deteriorating security situation.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nEU plans more sanctions with 'massive consequences'\n\nBRUSSELS — A senior European Union official says the 27-nation bloc intends to slap further sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEU Council president Charles Michel tweeted Friday: “Second wave of sanctions with massive and severe consequences politically agreed last night. Further package under urgent preparation.”\n\nMichel announced the move after a call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nMichel said Kyiv “is under continued attack by Russian forces” and called on Russia to immediately stop the violence.\n\nRussia stripped of Champions League final as UEFA shifts match to Paris\n\nLONDON - Russia was stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA on Friday with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe men's final will still be held on May 28 but now at the 80,000-seat Stade de France after the decision by UEFA's executive committee.\n\n\"UEFA wishes to express its thanks and appreciation to French Republic President Emmanuel Macron for his personal support and commitment to have European club football’s most prestigious game moved to France at a time of unparalleled crisis,” European football's governing body said in a statement. \"Together with the French government, UEFA will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.\"\n\nUkraine president: Russia has marked him ‘target No. 1’\n\nZelenskyy said Thursday he remains in the Ukraine capital of Kyiv, and intends to stay there, even as Russia has made him its top quarry.\n\n“The enemy has marked me as target No. 1, my family as target No. 2,” Zelenskyy said in an address to Ukrainians. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”\n\nAsked about Zelenskyy’s safety, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. is in touch with him and are working to provide him support.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels –bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles,many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017.

They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/03/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/9353494002/", "title": "Ukraine recap: Nuclear plant fire extinguished after Russian attacks", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Thursday, March. 3.

The latest information shows no indications of elevated levels of radiation, but officials are monitoring the situation closely, the official said.\n\nIn an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”\n\n“Only urgent action by Europe can stop the Russian troops,” he said. “Do not allow the death of Europe from a catastrophe at a nuclear power station.”\n\nThe assault renewed fears that the invasion could damage one of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and set off another emergency like the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which happened about 65 miles north of the capital.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the U.N.

The yacht was recently seized by Germany. The White House called Usmanov \"a close ally of Putin.''\n\nThe Biden administration is also imposing travel restrictions on 19 Russian oligarchs and their 47 family members and close associates. According to the White House, those oligarchs are known for directing, authorizing, funding or supporting Russia’s foreign policy. The administration has taken steps to place visa restrictions on the group.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said the sanctions are cutting off Russia's access to technology and the global financial system, and that they are having a deep impact.\n\n“The goal is to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm and loss to our allies and friends around the world,” Biden said. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nFormer Fox producer charged with violating sanctions against Russia for its 2014 takeover of Crimea\n\nFormer Fox News producer Jack Hanick was charged with sanctions violations and lying to the FBI in the first such indictment arising from sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Justice Department said Thursday.\n\nAccording to court documents unsealed in federal court in Manhattan, the 71-year-old Hanick worked for years for Konstantin Malofeyev even after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned for financing Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nThe indictment said Hanick, a U.S. citizen, “knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilizing messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria and Greece, in violation of those sanctions.”\n\nThe indictment comes a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the launch of a task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions and restrictions the U.S. and its allies have imposed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nUkrainians in U.S. granted temporary protection from deportation\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced temporary protected status for Ukrainians living in the United States, which will shield them from deportation for the next 18 months, as Ukraine continues to face ongoing attacks from Russia.\n\n“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”\n\nIndividuals must have continuously lived in the U.S. since March 1 to be eligible for TPS, DHS said.

About 90% of the 150,000 combat forces Putin deployed to Ukraine’s borders are now inside the country, said the official, who described military movements on condition of anonymity.\n\nHeavily populated southern cities along the Black Sea and Sea of Azov were among primary targets as Russia's campaign threatened to cut off shipping. Hennadiy Lahuta, governor of Kherson Oblast, said the government building in the Black Sea port city of Kherson, with a population of almost 280,000, was seized by Russian troops. Units were also bearing down on Mykolaiv, 40 miles to the northwest and home to almost half a million Ukrainians, The New York Times reported. U.S. officials said Russia had fired 480 missiles at Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces failed to capture Mariupol, a city of 450,000 on the Azov Sea, and had \"resorted to a blockade, creating a humanitarian disaster,\" the Ukrainian military said. Food, water and even electricity have been cut off, women and children halted from evacuating. In the vital energy-producing southern city of Enerhodar, a hub on the Dnieper River, Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts, Mayor Dmytro Orlov said.\n\nThe Ukraine military said four large landing ships and three missile boats were moving through the Black Sea in the direction of the Odesa and its 1 million residents. Russian sailors were firing on civilian ships and taking prisoners, according to the military.\n\nRussia has acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed in the war and about 1,600 wounded. Ukraine, which has not released casualty figures for its own armed forces, has estimated Russian troop losses at up to 9,000.\n\nUkraine’s State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died, though it was impossible to verify the claim. The U.N. human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, including 15 under age 18, and 525 injured, since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.\n\nZelenskyy says 16,000 foreign volunteers have answered call to fight for Ukraine\n\nUkraine has sent out a call for foreign volunteers to join its fight against the Russian invaders, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there has been a strong response.\n\nIn a video posted online, Zelenskyy said the first 16,000 fighters from other countries \"are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us, and for all.''\n\nWhile many governments are limiting their involvement in the war to sending weapons and other forms of aid, which Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for, others have gone a step further.\n\nThe Czech Republic said Thursday it won’t get in the way of its citizens who decide to join international brigades to help Ukraine. Serving in a foreign army is punishable by a prison term in the Czech Republic, but Prime Minister Petr Fiala said those who fight for Ukraine in this war would be pardoned by President Milos Zeman, with him co-signing it.\n\nCongressmen want oligarchs' assets 'repurposed' to benefit Ukraine\n\nReps. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) and Joe Wilson (R-SC) introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday to seize any assets from oligarchs whose wealth is linked to the corruption of Vladimir Putin’s repressive regime and “repurpose” them to help Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation authorizes the Biden administration to confiscate any property – including luxury villas, yachts and airplanes – valued over $5 million from Russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the U.S. government for their involvement in the Kremlin’s invasion and human rights violations in Ukraine.\n\nAny funds gained from asset sales must then be used to benefit the Ukrainian people through the provision of military and humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and technology to ensure the free flow of information in Ukraine, the two lawmakers said.\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nWhite House seeks $10 billion for Ukraine\n\nThe White House on Thursday requested $10 billion from Congress to aid Ukraine. Much of the aid to Ukraine would be used to support the country’s military in its fight against the Russian invasion, though a significant portion would also go toward humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians fleeing violence or who have been made food insecure by the attack.\n\n“To continue this important work and further support the Ukrainian people, we are requesting $10 billion to deliver additional humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the neighboring region in the coming days and weeks,” Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a blog post.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\n1 million have fled in 'swiftest exodus this century'\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled the fighting. The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed. The Ukrainian government said at least 34 people were killed and 285 injured, including 10 children, during the shelling of Kharkiv.\n\nIn one week, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to a tally from the United Nations, which called the mass flight one of the \"swiftest refugee exodus this century.\"\n\nPutin siege tactics could bring mass destruction, death to Ukraine\n\nPutin's military forces seem poised to adopt siege tactics that could result in enormous civilian deaths and infrastructure damage after their initial assault has failed to topple the Ukrainian government, officials and experts say. The Ukrainian cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol have come under heavy bombardment from airstrikes and artillery – similar to tactics Putin used in Syria and Chechnya.\n\n\"A siege is likely and may last as long as several weeks,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Armed Services Committee. \"He’ll try to wear down resistance in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other major cities, hitting civilian centers with massive explosives, airstrikes and missiles.\" Read more here.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPutin nuclear talk sparks run on iodine pills\n\nFighting in the vicinity of the former Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine followed by news Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had put his nuclear arsenal on alert has prompted a rush on iodine in some European countries. In Belgium, Pharmacists’ Union’s Michael Storme told the press agency Belga that druggists there had given away 30,000 packs of iodine tablets Monday alone. Some pharmacies in Finland were running out of iodine tablets, which can protect the thyroid gland from the effects of radiation.\n\nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that it is a “very specialized protection\" and says evacuation is the most effective measure because it \"protects the whole body from all radionuclides and all exposure pathways.\"\n\nZelenskyy: Russian soldiers are 'confused children'\n\nIn a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up their resistance but didn’t comment on whether the Russians have seized any cities.\n\n“They will have no peace here,” Zelenskyy said, calling on the Russian soldiers to “go home” and describing them as “confused children who have been used.” He said that for Ukrainians this was a patriotic war that won't end until the Russians have been driven out.\n\n\"Wherever they go they will be destroyed,\" Zerenskyy said. \"They will not have one quiet moment. The occupiers will receive only one thing from Ukrainians – resistance. Fierce resistance.\"\n\nBlack and brown refugees are being turned away at European borders\n\nAs increasing reports indicate people of color fleeing Ukraine are facing discrimination at the border, the crisis has once again highlighted a double standard in the way nations treat refugees based on country of origin, race, religion and more, academics and refugees say.\n\nMany of the same European nations that turned away refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia in the past are now largely welcoming refugees from Ukraine.\n\n\"It's great that Europe is being welcoming toward Ukrainian refugees. That should be the response,'' said Nell Gabiam, an associate professor at Iowa State University who studies forced migration. \"But it would be even better if that response was applied across the board toward all refugees who are fleeing persecution and war.\"\n\nFilippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, commended governments and citizens for their \"extraordinary acts of humanity and kindness\" but acknowledged some refugees have faced \"a different treatment\" at the border.

And on Monday, the Department of State urged all Americans to leave Russia, which could affect some collegians studying abroad.\n\nThe developments are especially striking given that universities celebrate their openness to cultural exchange, even with controversial governments such as China or Saudi Arabia. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine is testing how far the commitment to intellectual diversity can go in the face of war.

Only 34% of the country's population is fully vaccinated, according to WHO data.\n\n– Jordan Mendoza\n\nBiden banned Russia from US airspace. Here's what the area covers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights during his State of the Union address Tuesday, a decision with a sprawling geographic impact because of the numerous territories in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe move is a part of a global effort aimed at isolating Russia from the rest of the world. Cutting off Russian flights to the U.S. will impact airspace over the lower 48 states, Hawaii, Alaska and the American-controlled territories that expand across much of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThose territories include Palau and the Marshall Islands. And under the Compacts of Free Association, a series of treaties between the United States and those territories, the U.S. has access to and controls much of the airspace surrounding the islands.\n\n– Celina Tebor\n\nReport: China asked Russia to delay Ukraine invasion after Olympics\n\nSenior Chinese officials told Russian officials back in February not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, The New York Times reported Tuesday.\n\nThe Times, citing a Western intelligence report and quoting senior Biden administration officials and a European official, said that the Chinese officials had \"some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions\" before the invasion started last month.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Feb. 4 before the Winter Games kicked off in Beijing. According to the Times, it's not clear if conversations about the invasion took place in the meeting between Xi and Putin.\n\nAfter their meeting last month, both leaders issued a joint statement highlighting what they called “interference in the internal affairs” of other states, as Xi and Putin faced criticism from the United States over their foreign and domestic policies.\n\nThe relationship between China and Russia has grown over the past few decades, and the two nations opposed a further expansion of NATO. When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, China called for peace between the two countries and said the U.S. and its allies were worsening the conflict.\n\n– Charles Ventura, Asha C.

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you went to bed hoping Ian would go away, your dreams didn’t come true.\n\nIt’s big, strong, and will move northeast and soon slow down – all recipes for a worst-case scenario for the western coast of Florida.\n\nFor residents in the Tampa Bay area, “it’s time to stop looking on the internet and hoping that it’ll go away. It’s time to start acting,” Jamie Rhome, the National Hurricane Center acting director, told CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray on Monday.\n\nThe sun illuminates hurricane Ian on satellite imagery as it rises Tuesday morning. NOAA\n\nIan made landfall in western Cuba early Tuesday as a Category 3 hurricane with 125 mph winds. “Significant wind and storm surge impacts (are) occurring over western Cuba,” the hurricane center said.\n\nIan’s path takes it off the coast of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe storm intensified rapidly Monday and is expected to strengthen even more rapidly as it moves into the warmer waters of the Gulf.\n\nRead: Climate change is causing hurricanes to intensify faster than ever\n\nThe crazy thing about this is that the hurricane center forecast this rapid intensification. It has been difficult to predict in the past, but confidence in this storm’s intensity is high.\n\n“The NHC forecast for Ian has shown an unprecedented rate of strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful hurricane (winds increasing faster than in any previous forecast produced for any other tropical storm) – showing the confidence forecasters have in the potential for explosive growth),” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nThat confidence is only increasing now that the storm is moving where they expected and at the intensity they expected.\n\nYet, even though we have a better idea of where this storm is going to go – looking at you, Florida – there is still some slight uncertainty about the exact landfall location.\n\nDon’t focus on that middle line shown in the forecast cone here:\n\nAnyone inside the cone is at risk of a landfalling major hurricane, one of last night’s big updates. The hurricane center now says Ian will maintain major hurricane intensity when it hits Florida.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles from the center of Ian. This means that more than 15 million people will likely experience tropical storm-force winds, including all of Tampa metro and other cities such as Orlando, Tallahassee and Jacksonville.\n\nThese are the most likely arrival of tropical storm-force winds:\n\nTuesday afternoon/evening – The Florida Keys\n\nTuesday overnight – Naples\n\nWednesday morning – Tampa\n\nWednesday evening – Orlando\n\nThursday morning – Tallahassee and Jacksonville\n\nStorm surge is a real threat\n\nThe exact location of the hurricane’s landfall will make a dramatic difference in the location of the surge.\n\n“Landfall in the southern part of the cone will take Tampa Bay out of the extreme surge and put Charlotte Harbor in the center of the worst conditions,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. “Landfall to the north of Tampa puts the massive surge right into Tampa Bay.”\n\nWhy coastal communities should fear storm surge\n\nLiterally, 50 miles one way or the other changes everything.\n\nIf it makes landfall north of Tampa, this will push water levels to a height not seen in over 50 years of tide level records in Tampa Bay.\n\n“This is a near worst-case approach angle coming in from the south and west and stalling,” Rhome said.\n\nThat slowing forward momentum will allow for another extreme event to unfold. There are damaging winds in the eyewall and the surge. There is also the potential for flooding rainfalls, said Myers.\n\nThere is “the potential for rainfall totals of 20 to 25 inches as the storm appears to temporarily stall after landfall creating massive rainfall flash flooding,” said Myers.\n\nThe average September brings about 6 inches of rain to the Tampa region.\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

And because of this, their own rough treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities and their long, violent and bitter shared history with the country, Palestinians like Farhat and others in the wider community are finding it hard to denounce the attacks on Israel even though they say they don't approve of violence against civilians.\n\n\"Killing anybody is wrong,\" said a Palestinian man chatting with friends Saturday in downtown Ramallah.\n\n\"But imagine you live somewhere and I come and lock you in your house. I control everything that comes in and out of your house. Occasionally, I come and beat you up. Eventually you're going to resist and start fighting back with whatever you have,\" he said. With the Hamas attacks, \"that's what's happening.\"\n\nIsrael contends it controls access to Gaza for security reasons.\n\n\"I am powerless to help them, and for every 10 times I try to reach them on the phone, I get through maybe once,\" Farhat, 60, said Saturday, speaking about his wife, 12 children and \"many grandchildren\" on the grounds of a school in Ramallah. That's where 130 Palestinian workers from Gaza, deported from Israel alongside him, were being temporarily sheltered in a large hall. USA TODAY could not independently verify their accounts, but all had similar stories of detention and displacement. The Israel Prison Service did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe full names of the men at the school spoken to for this story are being withheld, at their request, for their own safety. Other names of Palestinians are being withheld to limit possible damage to their professional reputations.\n\nHamas attacks Israel:How police and military are still trying to find the gunmen\n\n'Where can we go? We are all under attack'\n\nThe school hall in Ramallah was filled with floor mats arranged in neat rows, rumpled sleeping bags, discarded plastic water bottles and scores of pacing men − only men − who said they simply had no idea how they could help themselves or their families, let alone reunite with them.\n\n\"I don't care if I die,\" said Imad, 58, another Palestinian electrician from Gaza who was deported to the West Bank with Farhat. He has eight children and helps care for several more from a son who died a few years ago after a battle with cancer. Farhat said he is never certain whether his family members are alive or dead.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are fleeing to the south of Gaza, close to Egypt, with whatever they can carry and by whatever means of transportation they can find. With fuel scarce, some are using horses and carts.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry says more than 2,700 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting erupted, and fatalities are occurring at a rate of every five minutes amid Israeli airstrikes.\n\nAlmost 10,000 Gazans, half of them women and children, have been injured. As many as 50,000 pregnant women are not able to access basic health services, according to the U.N. So far, Israel has not allowed aid in. It says it wants Hamas to release captives first. Egypt has been unwilling to open its border to fleeing Gazans.\n\n\"Where can we go? We are all under attack,\" said Imad's wife, Hayat, when reached by phone Saturday in Khan Younis, a city in the south of Gaza. The city has ballooned to more than 1 million people as Israel's military has warned Palestinian civilians to leave northernGaza ahead of an expected ground offensive targeting Hamas.\n\nKhan Younis usually has a population of about 400,000 people.\n\n'They cursed us, treated us like animals'\n\nMany Palestinians at the school in Ramallah drew attention to their bruised wrists.\n\nThe bruises are the result, they said, of zip ties placed on them by Israeli police. For years Israel has adopted a controversial policy of \"administrative detention,\" which allows the authorities to detain Palestinians of all ages without trial and under allegations it keeps secret. Israel says the tactic is necessary to contain dangerous militants whom the government believes could be terrorists.\n\nRights groups argue the practice amounts to extrajudicial detention and punishment.\n\nFarhat and Imad said police refused to let them use the bathroom while they were being held.\n\nThey showed photos on their phones, taken by eyewitnesses, of what appeared to be them kneeling while blindfolded in front of police and other Israeli security services. They said that the younger men among them were beaten, though they also said that some Israeli soldiers sought to intervene to stop it.\n\n\"They cursed us, treated us like animals and accused us of killing (Israeli) children − of being responsible for (the attacks in Israel) and what's happening in Gaza,\" Farhat said.\n\n\"'Piss in your pants if you need to,' the Israeli soldiers told us,\" Imad said.\n\nA third man at the school who was listening to Imad speak said he and his wife, who is in Gaza, have decided it would be best for her die in their own home rather than evacuate to the south.\n\n\"There is no safe place in Gaza,\" he said. \"Every place is targeted. The worst thing about this whole experience for me is that I am here but my mind is back there.\"\n\nEarlier that Saturday, word arrived that the entire family of another Palestinian worker staying at the school had been killed in an Israeli bombardment. He got so emotional and enraged he was taken to a medical clinic to be given sedatives.\n\nMinors shot in the head, chest, abdomen\n\nThe school where the workers were staying serves 800 children from kindergarten up to high school.\n\nIts director said some parents were concerned that the men's presence could cause it to be raided by Israel's military or attacked by vigilante Jewish settlers in the West Bank seeking to exact some kind of revenge for the 1,400 Israelis killed when Hamas crossed the border from Gaza to Israel to attack and kidnap civilians and soldiers.\n\nThe Israeli settlers live in West Bank communities that are illegal under international law. These settlements are built on Palestinian lands in a Palestinian-governed area that Israeli's military has occupied since it won a war in 1967 with Arab countries.\n\n\"Nowadays nobody can tell what these settlers will do,\" the director said, referring to the communities that have been expanded under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and are opposed by some Israelis.\n\n\"They seem free to do, and kill, whoever they like.\"\n\nSince the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas more than a week ago, at least 56 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 have been wounded in the West Bank in attacks on them by settlers and in confrontations with Israel's military, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nSome of those killed, according to Palestinian activists, included minors shot in the head, chest and abdomen.\n\nOn Friday alone, traditionally a day of protest, at least 14 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank in clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians near roads leading to checkpoints. Some were killed by settlers.\n\nA refusal to condemn Hamas\n\nMany of the Palestinians USA TODAY encountered in Ramallah and surrounding West Bank areas said that while they reject the idea of violence against civilians, Israelis or otherwise, they do not believe or feel it is their responsibility to forcefully condemn or repudiate the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians.\n\nMany also don't view Hamas as terrorist organization, as the U.S. and European Union designate it. They see the group as acting in self-defense to Israeli military actions.\n\nHamas is the de facto ruler of Gaza.\n\nThis refusal to condemn Hamas − a group that believes Israel should not exist − has angered the Israeli public and large swaths of international opinion as accounts and gory details have emerged of executions and kidnappings committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians. Among the kidnapped are elderly women and small children. Israel estimates that about 200 people, some of them police and soldiers, are being held hostage by Hamas. Fourteen Americans remain unaccounted for, though it is unclear how many may be held hostage.\n\nAn American advocated for Palestinians:Then Hamas came\n\nHuman rights groups say they are tracking evidence of war crimes committed by both sides, with Israel's indiscriminate military campaign and \"complete siege of Gaza\" − its withholding of water, food, electricity and fuel − amounting to a \"collective punishment\" on Palestinian civilians, according to the United Nations. Both Israel and Hamas insist they are operating within the confines of international law.\n\n“We are at war. We are defending our homes,\" Israeli President Isaac Herzog said at a media briefing Friday. “That’s the truth. And when a nation protects its home, it fights. And we will fight until we break their backbone.”\n\nIn an interview with the Economist magazine last week, Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas leader, said that his group's operation in Israel targeted only \"military posts.\"\n\nThe official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises civilian control over the West Bank, published comments Sunday by President Mahmoud Abbas that criticized Hamas for its actions. It later removed a reference to Hamas without providing an explanation.\n\nOn Monday, the news agency published comments from Abbas in which he rejected the killing of civilians on both sides and called for the release of civilians, prisoners and detainees on both sides. He did not mention Hamas.\n\n'I won't condemn Hamas'\n\nOn the outskirts of Ramallah, a 25-year-old graduate student was taking a break from her studies at a coffee shop in an upscale business park. She's studying for a master's degree in international law and wants to specialize in defending the human rights of Palestinians.\n\nShe was born in Chicago and holds dual citizenship.\n\nShe said there are a multitude of reasons why Palestinians like her are finding it hard to criticize Hamas.\n\nAmong them: Palestinians feel they have lived for decades in a world where attacks on them by Israelis have not been given similar public censure; millions of Palestinians lack basic rights as a result of Israel's military occupation, which imposes onerous restrictions on their movement, controls their water resources, and subjects them to forced evictions, police harassment, arbitrary detention and numerous other everyday indignities; Israeli transgressions of international law with its settlements and military actions are shrugged off; and Israel has slowly taken more Palestinian land while ministers in Netanyahu's government have openly called for ethic cleansing against Palestinian civilians.\n\n\"It hurts me that America is supporting Israel so much,\" she said.\n\n\"I won't condemn Hamas (for its attacks against Israeli civilians in the south) because Israel has been violating our rights for years. They've killed thousands in Gaza over several wars. What happened was a consequence of their own actions. We have the right to defend ourselves, and this is the first time we've done it.\"\n\nShe said some of the images and videos she had seen on social media of Hamas' brutalities in Israel were a \"tough\" watch. But she didn't think these images and videos represented the \"real Hamas,\" just the actions of lone bad actors. She said pregnant women and babies in Gaza were routinely killed by Israeli bombs.\n\n\"We don't want them dead,\" she said of Israelis. \"We want them out of our lands.\"\n\nA few tables away, a Palestinian man who lives in the U.S. and works for a well-known U.S. technology firm said he, too, thought it was not appropriate to condemn Hamas for its assault on Israelis.\n\n\"Being a Palestinian, you are continuously under systematic violence on a daily basis,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of it is invisible to the external world. Yet literally two hills away from where were are sitting is an illegally occupied settlement. They call them 'settlements.' But that's actually too benign a word. It's actually a colony. Palestinians are surrounded by extremists who are colonizing our lands.\"\n\nHe said Americans and others who don't know the region very well need to understand that \"there's a context (to the Hamas raid in Israel on Oct. 7) that's a lot larger than a single event.\"\n\nIsrael pulled out of its settlements in Gaza in 2005 and has since fought multiple wars there with Hamas.\n\nSupport for Hamas may grow\n\nOn Saturday night, USA TODAY briefly visited a hill on the edge of Ramallah near a giant bronze statue of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela where groups of Palestinians had gathered.\n\nThey chatted excitedly as they sat around small fires and snacked on seeds and nuts.\n\nThey also scanned the horizon for signs of Hamas rockets launched from Gaza toward Tel Aviv, whose lights lay shimmering about 25 miles away. None flew by over the course of an hour.\n\nLet's talk about your peace plan:Rep. Rashida Tlaib's grandmother to Donald Trump\n\nLess than a mile away, a green laser sight emanating from an adjacent Israeli settlement scanned this same hillside, its beam occasionally coming to stop in the bushes 100 yards or so down from the viewing point.\n\nOne man who was watching remarked that he thought it was an Israeli sniper looking for Palestinian intruders.\n\nKhaldoun Barghouti, a Ramallah-based Palestinian researcher and analyst of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, said he believes Israel's decision to bomb Gaza, killing hundreds of civilians and causing widespread destruction, has led to more support for Hamas among Palestinians.\n\nHe said it has \"turned blame to Hamas (over the attacks in Israel) into more anger toward Israel.\"\n\nIn the U.S, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy died Sunday after he was stabbed in Illinois. Authorities believe the attack was in response to the Israel-Hamas war. Attorney General Merrick Garland warned the incident would raise fears among Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities about hate-fueled violence.\n\nA number of European countries have heightened protection for Jewish communities because of a rise in antisemitic incidents after Hamas’ attacks.\n\n'They don't know we are here. If they did I think they'd kill us'\n\nFarhat, Imad and the other Palestinians from Gaza at the school who were receiving sanctuary after being deported from Israel were moved Sunday to Jericho, a West Bank Palestinian city in the Jordan Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, when they weren't trying to check on their families, they spent most of their time staring at snippets of video on their phones that showed the impact of Israel's bombing campaign.\n\nFloppy children being rushed, half-dead, to hospitals. Streams of exhausted-looking Gazans converging on Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, only to find unbelievably cramped conditions.\n\nThey collected names of Palestinians, fellow workers in Israel, whom they had not seen since their arrest.\n\nThey were getting worried about what happened to them.\n\nOne man named Mahmoud was trying to solve what seemed like yet another insurmountable problem.\n\nA relative and the man's friend, he said, neighbors back in Gaza, were hiding in a room in southern Israel, where they worked in a kitchen. They had been there since the first day of the Hamas assault and now feared that if they ventured outside, Israel's military would mistake them for militants.\n\nThey shared their Israeli work permits to prove their identities.\n\nThey were't sure what to do. They might try to sneak out.\n\n\"They don't know we are here. If they did I think they'd kill us,\" one of the men said in a phone call with USA TODAY. They did not want their location or identity to be made public.\n\nHe estimated they had enough food and water for another three days.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/27/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/6960680001/", "title": "Ukraine agrees to meet with Russia; ruble plunges: recaps", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, Feb. 27. Click here to follow the latest updates and news from Monday, Feb. 28, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\n***\n\nWhile Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s nuclear weapons on high alert, more support poured in for Ukraine in its ongoing effort to fend off Russian forces, which on Sunday reached the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe European Union announced unprecedented new actions against Russia, outlining plans to close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund a weapons purchase to assist Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, while the Associated Press reported the United States approved the delivery of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine.\n\nWestern powers in support of Ukraine could soon be joined by Switzerland, an oftentimes neutral country that on Monday is set to review potential sanctions and asset freezes against Russia, said President Ignazio Cassis via Reuters. Cassis said it was “very probable” the country would follow suit, the outlet reported.\n\nThe office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said a delegation would meet with Russian officials for talks near the Belarus border. The discussion was expected to happen Monday morning local time, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin via CNN.\n\nAlso Monday, both the 193-member U.N. General Assembly and the smaller, 15-member Security Council plan to hold emergency meetings on Russia’s invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s order to make his nuclear weapons more ready for launch – made Sunday in response to “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers and economic sanctions by the West – represents an unnecessary and dangerous move, according to the Pentagon.\n\nA senior Defense Department official said Russia is under no threat from the United States and its NATO allies. The Pentagon is confident it can protect the U.S. and its allies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is heading towards a fifth day of fighting. According to the Associated Press, Russian troops entered Kharkiv on Sunday, where videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across the city and a vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, according to the Ukrainian president's office.\n\nUkrainian officials said Sunday the civilian death toll has reached 352.\n\nA few things to catch you up on:\n\nTHE NEWS COMES TO YOU: Get the latest updates on the situation in Ukraine.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:The enigma of Vladimir Putin: What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way. We need to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity by considering other human beings as brothers and sisters,\" the spiritual leader said on his website. \"This is how we will build a more peaceful world.\"\n\nThe Nobel peace prize winner also said any problems and disagreements are best resolved through dialogue. \"Genuine peace comes about through mutual understanding and respect for each other's well-being,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he hopes peace is swiftly restored.\n\n\"We must not lose hope,\" he said. \"The 20th century was a century of war and bloodshed. The 21st century must be a century of dialogue.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTwo United Nations sessions scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N.’s two major bodies -- the 193-nation General Assembly and the more powerful 15-member Security Council -- will hold separate meetings Monday on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a reflection of widespread international demands for an immediate cease-fire and escalating concern for the plight of millions of Ukrainians caught up in the war.\n\nThe Security Council gave a green light Sunday for the first emergency session of the General Assembly in decades. It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nMore:Ukraine athletes defend country, demand sanctions for Russia\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ukraine: departing the country may take up to 30 hours\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is now urging U.S citizens in Ukraine to try leaving using private transportation options as leaving could in some cases take more than 30 hours.\n\nThe embassy said Sunday “conditions may deteriorate” in various parts of the country without any warning due to the escalating Russian invasion.\n\n“Careful consideration should be made to routes and the risks of travel because Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations have been destroyed. Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nMore:Satellite images show damaged airport in Hostomel following strikes\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal. They hinder Russia’s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value.\n\nSanctions announced earlier had taken the Russian currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:What sanctions does Russia face? Here's a list by country\n\nUS official: Belarus may join Ukraine invasion\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official says Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces that invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nBelarus has been providing support for Russia’s war effort but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.\n\nThe American official has direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments and says the decision by Belarus’ leader on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine happening in the coming days. The official spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nRussian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:There may be risk, but the U.S. will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nRussia rendering Facebook unusable in some places\n\nRussia has apparently rendered Facebook largely unusable across leading Russian telecommunications providers amid rising friction between Moscow and the social media platform.\n\nThe London-based internet monitor NetBlocks reports that Facebook’s network of content-distribution servers in Russia was so badly restricted Sunday that “content no longer loads, or loads extremely slowly making the platforms unusable.”\n\nRussian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor on Friday announced plans to “partially restrict” access to Facebook. That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:There may be risk, but the US will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them. We can isolate them in the United Nations. We can isolate them in U.N. specialized agencies. They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials. Marakova said Ukraine is ready “for any peace talks that would stop the war and get them out from our country.” But the Ukrainians will not surrender, she said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCotton: West must stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on sanctions\n\nSen. Tom Cotton on Sunday called on the Biden administration and American businesses to provide “no support whatsoever” to Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“We can do more than prayers and hashtags and lining up building storage,” he said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “It's time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussyfooting around.”\n\nCotton appealed to the Biden administration to increase its sanctions on Russian banks, arguing that while the administration says it has sanctioned 80% of Russian banks, Russian President Vladimir Putin “controls 100% of banks.”\n\nThe Arkansas Republican also blamed Western nations for underestimating Putin’s ambition.\n\nDespite a strong condemnation of Putin, Cotton stopped short of condemning former President Donald Trump, who has called Putin “smart” and his plan both “savvy” and “genius.” Cotton repeatedly said he does not speak for other politicians.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\n‘This is a different Putin’: Rice says Putin ‘erratic’\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin recent behavior is a departure from her past encounters with the “cold and calculating” leader.\n\n“This is a different Putin,” Rice, who served under former President George W. Bush, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" “He seems erratic… He has descended into something I have not seen before.”\n\nWhile Rice said the prospect of peace talks was promising, she urged Ukraine to follow the advice of former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Trust but verify,” she said. “It’s always a good thing if there is a chance (at peace),” she said.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nMore:A song of defiance: Ukraine's national anthem being heard all over the world\n\nPsaki: Putin 'manufacturing threats' to justify attack on Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert is another example of the Russian leader “manufacturing threats” to justify aggression against Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday.\n\n“We’ve seen him do this time and time again,” Psaki said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “At no time has Russia been under threat from NATO.”\n\n“This is all a pattern from President Putin,” Psaki said, “and we’re all going to stand up” to him.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCondoleeza Rice: Putin faces unexpected reality in Ukraine\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said Russian President Vladimir Putin may have “bitten off more than he can chew” perhaps forcing early peace talks.\n\nRice, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" said Putin likely believed that he could \"waltz\" into Ukraine.\n\n“But the reality has been quite different.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nRomney casts the war as a battle of 'good and evil'\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, cast Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion as a battle of \"good and evil,\" and called for more sanctions on the \"evil regime\" of Vladimir Putin.\n\nSpeaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Romney also said he hopes Putin will use potential peace talks with Ukraine as an opportunity to back off.\n\n\"He made a huge error,\" Romney said of Putin. \"This is not going well for him.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\n‘A thug and despot’: Putin to feel pain of new financial sanctions\n\nRemoving Russia from a global banking network as part of a new round of sanctions “will make a big difference” in isolating the Kremlin, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies Saturday cut Russia from the key financial messaging network known as SWIFT, in an escalation of its sanctioning campaign.\n\nKlobuchar called Putin “a thug and a despot,” who misjudged the world’s reaction to Russia aggression.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\n'Unacceptable': Thomas-Greenfield says Putin escalating conflict in Ukraine\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday that Vladimir Putin’s decision to put nuclear deterrent forces on high alert indicates the Russian president is “continuing to escalate” the war in Ukraine in a way that is “unacceptable.”\n\nSpeaking on CBS’ \"Face the Nation,\" Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. is using “every possible lever” to stop Russia’s invasion of its neighbor and that the U.N. Security Council will meet later Sunday.\n\n“I’m not surprised at this information because Putin has tried every means possible to actually put fear in the world in terms of his actions. It just means that we need to ramp up up our actions at the U.N.”\n\nWhen asked whether there’s a threat of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield responded: “Certainly nothing is off the table with this guy.”\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nPutin orders nuclear deterrent forces on high alert\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces Sunday to be on high alert, a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West that brought immediate condemnation from the U.S. as Russia continues its full-scale assault on Ukraine.\n\nPutin, announcing the move on Russian state television, called it a response to “aggressive statements” and tough financial sections from NATO countries. The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy asks UN top court to halt Russian invasion, says Moscow 'manipulating the notion of genocide'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of manipulating the notion of genocide to justify invading its neighbor and urged the International Court of Justice to hold trials.\n\nLocated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICJ is the main judicial arm of the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe ICJ rules on disputes between states, including responsibility for breaches of international law. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy is a lion of a leader | Opinion\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride.” Those are the words proclaimed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the midst of terrible death and destruction and the most egregious threat to Europe since World War II, Ukrainians are teaching the rest of the world a lesson about freedom, resolve and love of country.\n\nWhen offered an escape from Kyiv, allegedly by the United States, the 44-year-old Ukrainian president immediately rejected the notion and demonstrated selfless leadership and a portrait of courage generally reserved for Hollywood.\n\nMany leaders would have abandoned ship, putting their own personal safety above that of their countrymen. Zelenskyy, on the other hand, is taking a stand for freedom, boldly demonstrating that freedom is worth fighting for; that a government of, by and for the people is worth defending.\n\n– August Pfluger (Read more of August Pfluger's column.)\n\nNHL star Alex Ovechkin called over over stance on war\n\nHockey Hall of Famer Dominik Hasek has called for the NHL to \"immediately suspend contracts for all Russian players\" amidst Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe 57-year-old Czech also had some choice words for Washington Capitals' Russian-born star Alex Ovechkin, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHasek, who played in the NHL for 16-seasons and is widely considered one of the best goaltenders of all time, called Ovechkin an \"alibist,\" a \"liar\" and a \"chicken (expletive)\" after Ovechkin failed to publicly denounce Putin and his country's aggression.\n\n– Cydney Henderson\n\nUkraine rejects location for talks with Russia\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is ready for peace talks with Russia but not in Belarus.\n\nSpeaking in a video message Sunday, Zelenskyy suggested meeting in Warsaw, Poland; Bratislava, Slovakia; Istanbul; Budapest, Hungary; or Baku, Azerbaijan. He said other locations are also possible but made clear that Ukraine doesn’t accept Russia’s selection of Belarus, which Russia has used as a staging ground for its invasion.\n\nThe Kremlin said Sunday a Russian delegation had arrived in Homel, Belarus, for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the delegation includes military officials and diplomats.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRussia's cutting off port access\n\nRussia was working Sunday to limit strategic strategic ports along the Ukraine’s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nRussia’s military also put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine, blocking the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nCutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussia targets Ukraine airfields in next phase\n\nRussia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities in what appeared to be the next phase of an invasion that has been slowed by fierce resistance.

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/30/courts-reject-voting-rights-extensions-in-covid-shadowed-elections/5998149002/", "title": "Election results for Biden, Trump could be decided by these lawsuits", "text": "In Alabama, a Black man with Parkinson's disease and asthma asked a court to allow curbside voting but was turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court. In Florida, 700,000 felons trying to regain their right to vote were hampered by five judges appointed by President Donald Trump. In Arkansas, three judges appointed by Republican presidents told elderly residents worried about COVID-19 exposure they could sign ballot initiatives through a window.\n\nAt the same time, arguments from Trump's lawyers have been shot down in several states, and the president was dealt two setbacks by the Supreme Court just before Election Day in cases that expanded absentee voting – a procedure he has criticized without evidence as the source of ballot fraud.\n\nThose outcomes are part of a record-setting number of lawsuits that have been filed this year, with even more expected to come after polls close Tuesday. In all, more than 230 election-related federal lawsuits were filed from Jan. 1 to Oct. 23, higher than any of the past three presidential election years during the same time period, a USA TODAY analysis of federal court data found.\n\nThe outcomes have been mixed. Voting rights advocates won numerous COVID-19-related decisions that expanded access to absentee ballots, extended deadlines to count those ballots and allowed blind and disabled voters to cast their ballots electronically or by phone. Trump’s lawyers and his supporters have also scored key victories, locking in Election Day deadlines for absentee voting, limiting the number of ballot drop boxes and blocking other measures to ease voting.\n\nThe flood of litigation has been powered by the coronavirus pandemic that forced states to adjust their normal voting protocols.\n\nLawyers representing Trump, the Republican Party and conservative voters have warned – with little evidence – of voter fraud as they’ve urged courts to limit voter registration efforts, block universal mail-in voting and other pandemic-related changes.\n\n\"The electoral process cannot function properly if it lacks integrity and results in chaos,\" Trump’s attorneys wrote in a Nevada lawsuit.\n\nSupporters of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, civil rights groups and organizations representing vulnerable communities have fought back. They have urged judges to eliminate requirements that witnesses sign absentee ballots and approve postage-free envelopes for absentee ballots.\n\n\"We have seen a level of voter suppression that has really been unprecedented in its breadth, in its depth, in its innovation, in its geographic reach,\" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nUSA TODAY's review of hundreds of lawsuits that were filed or had significant rulings in 2020 found that courts have already made pivotal decisions on who can vote, how they vote and the process used to count their votes. USA TODAY also reviewed election lawsuit data compiled and maintained by the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project and the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe analysis found that Trump has already been assisted by the legions of federal court judges he appointed during his first term in office. Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the conservative Federalist Society legal group, the president has installed more than a quarter of all federal judges.\n\nThe Supreme Court has played a significant role in election-related cases, issuing a series of decisions halting lower-court rulings that would have expanded voting access. This week’s confirmation of Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee, further cemented the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, giving Trump and Republicans an even more significant advantage heading into what is expected to be a post-Election Day legal frenzy.\n\n\"We saw a wave of judges ... issuing very careful rulings protecting voting rights and carefully crafting remedies so people can vote safely during the pandemic, and the Supreme Court issued rulings that just swept them away without any explanation,\" said Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan think tank based in New York.\n\nThe lawsuits are a culmination of a decades-long trend that started with the infamous Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. The contest was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, a ruling that has resulted in a steady increase of election-related lawsuits ever since. Richard Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who has tracked election-related lawsuits for three decades, said the 2018 midterm elections had set the latest record for election year lawsuits, but 2020 is on pace to set a new mark.\n\nAt times, the hyperpoliticized nature of the 2020 election cycle has contributed to lawsuits that often sound like an angry Twitter feed.\n\nIn Michigan, a Republican state candidate argued in court documents that sending absentee ballot requests to all voters would only help \"the deep state.\" In Illinois, a county Republican Party accused the state's Democratic governor of implementing an emergency election system designed to minimize Republican ballots and \"if the election still doesn’t turn out the way he wants it, to generate enough Democratic ballots after election day to sway the result.\"\n\nLawsuits initiated by Democrats and advocacy groups have accused Republican election officials of purposefully curtailing the vote for constituencies that don't support them. In Minnesota, several groups challenged a state law requiring a witness to sign absentee ballots, which they claim is discriminatory to African and Native Americans who tend to suffer from higher rates of preexisting conditions that make their communities more vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nBelow is a look at the legal landscape across the nation. A handful of states, including Hawaii and Wyoming, avoided significant legal battles and are not listed.\n\nAlabama\n\nVoters worried about exposing themselves to COVID-19 inside polling stations won a legal victory this summer when a judge ordered the state to make it easier to vote by mail and allow curbside voting.\n\nThat was a relief for the plaintiffs, including Howard Porter, a 70-year-old African American who has Parkinson's disease and asthma. He argued in court papers that he hadn't left his home since the pandemic started but can't vote absentee because the state requires a witness sign all absentee ballots, and Porter worries about exposing himself in that way.\n\n\"(So) many of my (ancestors) even died to vote,\" Porter said during a hearing. \"And while I don’t mind dying to vote, I think we’re past … that time.\"\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, election officials in Jefferson and Montgomery counties – home to the state's two largest cities, which both voted against Trump during the 2016 election – announced they would adopt curbside voting in time for November.\n\nAll those plans ended, however, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Alabama judge's ruling on Oct. 21 without explanation. In a dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor lamented the high court's decision, pointing out that even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended curbside voting to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe counties \"are ready and willing to help vulnerable voters like Mr. Porter cast their ballots without unnecessarily risking infection from a deadly virus,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"This Court should not stand in their way.\"\n\nAlaska\n\nAn Alaskan tribe sued the state government over a rule that required witness signatures on absentee ballots.\n\nResidents of Arctic Village, a tiny Native American community of 150 members deep in the mountains in northern Alaska, went into a severe lockdown after some members contracted COVID-19 and returned to the village. Leaders closed down the village to all outsiders and issued strict orders that people not congregate with anybody outside their household.\n\n\"The Tribe is aware that COVID-19-related deaths among Native communities is highest among any demographic group in the United States,\" its lawyers wrote. \"The Tribe has taken a series of drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus that, if not contained, has the potential to decimate the Arctic Village's entire population.\"\n\nState election leaders in this Republican-controlled state argued that the village made its request too late – the lawsuit was filed in September – and that it would create too much confusion for voters to alter absentee ballot rules so close to the November election. The judge disagreed, arguing that the state could easily send out public notices of the change and that the health of Alaskans was more important than any last-minute inconveniences to the state.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Dani Crosby, who called the pandemic \"a shifty beast,\" sided with the tribe, concluding that absentee ballots could risk the lives of voters and ordering the state to accept absentee ballots without a witness signature.\n\nArizona\n\nPerhaps no other state has seen more judicial rulings limiting voting rights than Arizona, a Republican-leaning state that has emerged as a possible win for Biden this year.\n\nIn one case, two advocacy groups persuaded a federal judge to extend the state's Oct. 3 voter registration deadline by nearly three weeks because of COVID-19 delays. But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down that ruling, ordering that voter registrations be shut down on Oct. 15. More than 7,000 voters registered during the extension period.\n\nThe appeals court struck down another ruling that would have allowed voters who accidentally mailed their absentee ballots without signing them an opportunity to fix the error up to five days after Election Day. The deadline is now Election Day.\n\nOne judge ruled that members of the Navajo Nation do not face unfair barriers to voting and struck down their request to extend the deadline to submit their absentee ballots. And another judge denied a request to waive the state's requirement that a witness be present when signing ballot initiatives, despite claims that the requirement puts medically compromised Arizonans at risk of exposing themselves to the coronavirus.\n\nOne of the rare legal victories for voting rights advocates came in Maricopa County, where Superior Court Judge Randall Warner allowed vulnerable voters to fill out their ballots by placing a video call to a county election official who fills out their ballot. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey objected to that practice, but Warner ruled that it was legal and necessary to protect disabled people and those in hospitals or nursing homes.\n\n\"Federal law does not allow Arizona to impose on a disabled voter the choice between voting and protecting their health,\" Warner wrote.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas voters have been shot down by federal judges in every attempt to expand their ability to vote in elections throughout 2020.\n\nOne federal judge struck down a request from voters to extend absentee ballot deadlines for the state’s May primary, arguing that Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson had already done enough when he loosened rules to secure a ballot.\n\nIn another case, a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a lower court ruling that would have eliminated the state’s requirement that all signatures gathered to get citizen petitions on the November ballot be witnessed and notarized. The lawsuit argues that such close contact exposes voters who are disabled, vulnerable to COVID-19 or living in nursing homes unable to sign those ballot initiatives without risking their lives.\n\nThe three appellate court judges – all appointed by Republican presidents – ruled that those voters could find creative ways to sign a ballot initiative without risking their health. In their opinion, the judges wrote that voters could be given \"sterilized petitions\" or sign them \"through a window from the safety of their homes.\"\n\n\"No doubt, the in-person signature requirement imposes real burdens,\" the judges wrote. \"We are just not persuaded it imposes severe burdens.\"\n\nThe League of Women Voters was also rejected when it filed a lawsuit requesting that voters whose signatures are deemed invalid are notified and given a chance to correct it. The organization argued that many factors may contribute to people signing their name differently on their ballot from the signature on file with the state.\n\n\"The rate of error only increases when signature matching is left to laypersons who have not received training in forensic document examination,\" the organization argued in its lawsuit.\n\nU.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes disagreed. The judge concluded that as many 600 ballots may be thrown out in the November election because of signature mismatches – a \"shockingly high\" number, in his words – but he ruled that the League of Women Voters did not prove its members' ballots would be the ones rejected, so he dismissed their request.\n\nCalifornia\n\nA citizen trying to get an initiative on the ballot to expand the use of food trucks argued that the coronavirus pandemic limited his ability to gather enough signatures. A judge denied him, arguing that public health takes precedence over his initiative.\n\nYet a group of environmentalists making a similar request to get a recycling initiative on the ballot were given a 2½-month extension to collect enough signatures. And a group of Native American tribes pushing a sports betting initiative was given 35 additional days to gather signatures.\n\nThe most controversial lawsuit, however, involves drop boxes that have been placed in several California counties by the state's Republican Party. Unlike the official drop boxes used throughout the country that are placed, monitored and collected by county election officials, the boxes in California are unofficial, managed entirely by GOP officials.\n\nXavier Becerra, the state’s Democratic attorney general, sued the Republican Party in state court, requesting that the party disclose the location of each drop box and the names, addresses and dates of birth of every voter who has used one. Republicans refused, arguing that the boxes were legal under the state’s “ballot harvesting” law that allows third parties to deliver mail-in ballots on behalf of voters. On Oct. 21, Superior Court Judge David Brown sided with the GOP, rejecting the attorney general’s request to investigate, but allowing the case to proceed.\n\nIn an email to The Associated Press, Becerra’s office wrote that they will continue pressing the legal case \"to ensure that every voter who casts their ballot will have their voices heard.\"\n\nThe Republican Party had its own response.\n\n\"This is a thuggish voter intimidation and vote suppression tactic by our Democratic Attorney General and Secretary of State,\" said Hector Barajas, spokesman for the California Republican Party.\n\nColorado\n\nCandidates and supporters of citizen initiatives made multiple requests to be included on the ballot, arguing that they only fell short of the number of signatures needed because COVID-19 restrictions made it difficult – and irresponsible – to collect them.\n\nOne Senate candidate gathered 51% of the required signatures and another gathered 90%. Each of them won initial approval from judges.\n\n\"A candidate who still manages to collect at least one-half of the required valid number of signatures from an electorate absorbed within a global pandemic, has shown he or she enjoys enough public support to justify putting the candidate on a primary ballot,\" Denver District Court Judge Christopher Baumann said during a hearing in May.\n\nIn each case, the state Supreme Court overturned the judges. The court ruled that limitations on gathering signatures has been \"one of the unfortunate impacts of the virus,\" but ultimately found that gathering enough signatures is a \"strict\" requirement of state law.\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe legal battles in Connecticut have focused on the state’s decision to mail absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. Several Republican candidates for office challenged the governor’s order because the state only allows people to vote absentee for a limited number of reasons.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Thomas Moukawsher struck down the Republicans’ request, arguing that the governor was empowered to make changes to the process in the name of public health. The judge focused on one of the existing excuses to vote absentee listed in the state's constitution: \"because of sickness.\"\n\n\"COVID-19 is the scourge of the earth,\" the judge wrote. \"It is a sickness of a lethality and ubiquity unknown for a hundred years. So it can be said with some confidence that the executive branch has not so broadly interpreted the constitutional language as to make it meaningless.\"\n\nDelaware\n\nOnly two election-related lawsuits have been filed in Delaware.\n\nIn one case, the League of Women Voters of Delaware requested that the deadline to receive mail-in ballots be extended by 10 days. Nearly 3% of votes cast in the state’s July presidential primary arrived too late, the result of increased absentee voting this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and delays at the U.S. Postal Service. If that trend holds for the November election, the organization worries that thousands of votes will be thrown out.\n\n\"This disenfranchisement – which is all but guaranteed for some number of voters – is tantamount to depriving voters of access to the polls,\" the league wrote in court papers.\n\nIn another case, the Delaware Republican Party challenged a universal vote-by-mail plan passed by the state’s Democrat-run General Assembly to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Mirroring lawsuits filed in other states, the Delaware Republicans argued that such a dramatic increase in mail-in voting would throw the entire election into question because the vote-by-mail system \"is rife with potential problems and pitfalls.\"\n\nJudges denied both requests.\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida is already infamous for its role in the 2000 election recount, which left the presidential election undecided for five weeks and launched a 20-year period of nonstop litigation that has grown year after year.\n\n2020 has been no different, with judges deciding everything from voter registration deadlines to drop boxes to the order in which candidate names must appear on the ballot. But one case may end up being the most influential in terms of how many people get to vote in November.\n\nIn 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment allowing most felons to regain their right to vote. But the next year, the Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a law forcing felons to repay all of their court fees, fines and restitution before regaining their right to vote.\n\nCritics have called the law a modern-day poll tax. Supporters have said they’re simply carrying out the will of the voters.\n\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state, upholding the law in September on a straight party-line vote. The six judges on the court who sided with Florida were appointed by Republican presidents, including five appointed by Trump. The four judges who opposed Florida were named by Democratic presidents.\n\n\"Because court costs and fees are legitimate parts of a criminal sentence – that is, part of the debt to society that felons must pay for their crimes – there is no basis to regard them as a tax,\" the appeals court ruled.\n\nThe end result is that 770,000 Floridians who could have voted in November must now repay every dollar they owe before regaining their right to vote. And in a state that was decided by 537 votes in 2000, and tiny fractions in every presidential election since, that decision could make all the difference.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMost lawsuits requesting expanded voting opportunities have been struck down by Trump-appointed judges in this Republican-dominated state.\n\nOne case saw a federal judge appointed by Obama order the state to extend the deadline to receive absentee ballots three days after Election Day. A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which included two judges appointed by Trump, struck down that ruling, keeping the absentee ballot deadline in place.\n\nIn another case, a group requested that the state send absentee ballot applications in Spanish to Gwinnett County voters, since the Atlanta suburb is 22% Hispanic. U.S. District Judge William Ray seemed to agree, concluding that providing ballots in their native language was \"reasonable\" and \"may very well be the best public policy.\" Still, the judge – a Trump appointee – denied the request on a technicality: county election officials are required by law to distribute Spanish-language election material, but the state, which distributed the ballots, was under no such requirement.\n\nIn a separate suit, the Democratic Party of Georgia requested wholesale changes, including more voting locations, poll workers and technical support to fix malfunctioning voting machines, after the state’s June primary led to people waiting up to eight hours in line to vote and voters again faced long lines at the start of early voting in the general election. The Democrats argued that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has overseen a methodical process of closing polling locations and limiting services that have led to \"voters (and particularly minority voters) waiting in unconscionably long lines to exercise their right to vote.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Brown – a Trump appointee – denied the request, concluding that the Democratic Party had \"not shown long lines are certainly impending in November.\"\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho hasn’t seen much election litigation, but one of its cases had the distinction of being one of the few where the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in with a written opinion.\n\nThe high court has delivered a handful of rulings that have limited access to voting so far, but most of its decisions have been issued with no explanation. But in July, the justices chimed in on a lawsuit filed by Reclaim Idaho, a group trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would increase educational funding in the state.\n\nLower courts had sided with the group, ordering the state to either put the initiative on the ballot or grant the group more time to reach the 56,000 signatures it needed. The Supreme Court blocked those rulings because the High Court already saw conflicting orders around the country on the topic of ballot initiatives and indicated it would end up ruling on those conflicts sometime later.\n\n\"Since the onset of the pandemic, the Circuits have applied their conflicting frameworks to reach predictably contrary conclusions,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.\n\nThe Reclaim Idaho case was sent back to lower courts and is ongoing.\n\nIllinois\n\nThe Cook County Republican Party filed a lawsuit challenging Democratic Gov. J. B. Pritzker's emergency orders expanding absentee voting, arguing they would lead to widespread voter fraud.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Dow – appointed by President George W. Bush – disagreed, ruling that the Republican Party's arguments came down to \"unsupported speculation about potential criminal conduct.\"\n\nIndiana\n\nIndiana voters filed several lawsuits to expand absentee voting. But each time, judges appointed by Republican presidents turned down those requests.\n\nState law allows people to request absentee ballots only if they are over 65, disabled or have another documented reason to stay home. During the state’s June primary, the Indiana Election Commission allowed all voters to request absentee ballots because the state was under a stay-at-home order.\n\nBut the commission decided that in-person voting must return for the November election. A group of citizens challenged that ruling but were struck down by a Trump-appointed federal judge and denied again by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals – all appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nThe appeals court recognized the \"difficulties\" Hoosiers may face voting in-person in a state that has repeatedly broken daily coronavirus infection records throughout October.\n\n\"But Indiana's absentee-voting laws are not to blame,\" the appeals court concluded. \"It's the pandemic, not the State, that might affect Plaintiffs' determination to cast a ballot.\"\n\nIn a separate case where public interest groups tried to extend the deadline for the state to receive absentee ballots, a different panel of 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judges – all appointed by Republican presidents – was more blunt in denying the request.\n\n\"As long as the state allows voting in person, there is no constitutional right to vote by mail,\" they wrote.\n\nIowa\n\nThe Republican Party was active in Iowa’s courts this year, winning victories that expanded in-person polling locations and limited absentee voting in the few Democratic strongholds in the Republican state.\n\nIn one case, a former Republican state senator asked a judge to expand the number of polling locations in Woodbury County from two to five, arguing that Republicans, and especially men, tend to vote in-person on Election Day and that the state’s emphasis on absentee voting would harm those voters. A judge agreed, granting the request.\n\nIn another series of cases, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party tried to prevent election officials in three Iowa counties – including two that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 – from sending absentee ballot applications that were prepopulated with the voters’ information. Lawyers for the GOP argued that doing so would open the possibility of voter fraud because election officials couldn't be certain if the applications they received back were signed by the actual voter.\n\nJudges in all three cases agreed, ruling that the election process should be uniform throughout Iowa and that election officials must only send out blank absentee ballot applications. In Woodbury County, a judge also ordered the county to nullify the estimated 14,000 absentee ballot applications that had already been returned and contact each of those voters that they would need to complete a new, blank application themselves.\n\n\"While this certainly can create hardship with their ability to vote by absentee ballot, it will not prevent them from still being able to vote by absentee ballot or in-person,\" state District Court Judge Patrick Tott wrote.\n\nKentucky\n\nA lawsuit filed by a group of Republican voters charged that in its efforts to ease mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, the state of Kentucky actually made it harder for people to vote in person.\n\nThe suit, filed in June ahead of the primary election, questioned the decision by election officials to have only one polling location in five of the most populous counties in the state. The plaintiffs argued that cramming so many people into one voting location would expose people to COVID-19, since social distancing will be difficult and voting machines may not be sanitized between each use.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the move violates part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, saying singular polling locations will disproportionately hinder African American communities in Jefferson and Fayette counties, which hold roughly 60% of the commonwealth’s Black population.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Simpson, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, struck down the request, ruling that voters had expanded access to absentee voting this year and 15 days of early, in-person voting.\n\n\"While it may seem intuitive that, when it comes to polling places, more is better, that is not a call for this Court to make, unless we first find a constitutional or statutory violation,\" Simpson wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nSeveral groups filed a lawsuit requesting that Louisiana add more early voting days to reduce congestion at the polls.\n\nDuring a September court hearing held over a Zoom video call, the state called as one of its witnesses a doctor who expressed skepticism over the severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, according to court documents. Philip Barie, a professor of surgery and public health, claimed that the number of COVID-19 cases may be \"gross overestimates\" and downplayed the risk of in-person voting to Louisiana voters.\n\n\"But, when asked about his personal COVID-19 risk tolerance, he was far less cavalier,\" U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick later wrote. \"Barie testified that if he had close contact with a person infected with COVID-19, he would quarantine and would not vote in person (this would be an option for Dr. Barie, since he lives in New York City, which has implemented universal vote by mail due to the Virus).\"\n\nAfter that hearing, the judge ordered that early voting be extended from seven days to 10 days, a rare win for Louisiana voters who have struggled to expand voting options even as their coronavirus infections have skyrocketed throughout September and October.\n\nIn a separate case, several advocacy groups tried to expand absentee voting to a broader range of people, including a Black woman who suffers from asthma, according to court records. Her diagnosis was \"environmentally induced\" by pollutants near her home in Baton Rouge, which is part of a region known as \"Cancer Alley\" because of the high number of severe illnesses suffered by people living near chemical plants. Those residents are now disproportionately dying from COVID-19.\n\nA judge rejected the request, arguing that Louisiana’s election laws are constitutional.\n\nMore:Racism turned their neighborhood into 'Cancer Alley.’ Now they’re dying from COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nA group of blind voters won a victory when it forced the state into providing an absentee voting system that they could use.\n\nThe group argued that they can’t vote in person during a pandemic because blind people rely on carpools and public transportation to travel, exposing them to others with the virus, and navigating a polling location would force them to touch many surfaces to go through the line and fill in their ballot.\n\nThe state’s paper-based absentee voting system is no help either. The group requested that Maine follow the lead of other states by allowing them to use screen reader and ballot-marking software that allows blind people to mark their picks and sign their ballots electronically.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have been denied that right in violation of federal and state laws,\" the lawsuit read.\n\nOn Oct. 2, one month before Election Day, the state announced it would create a new online service that allows blind voters to use assistive technology to cast their votes from home.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story erroneously listed the resolution of a court case in Maine and several court rulings in Arizona. The state is handled by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMaryland\n\nIndependent and third-party candidates filed several lawsuits requesting that the state reduce the number of signatures required to get on the ballot.\n\n\"The prime venues for collection of petition signatures historically have been large gatherings, such as fairs, festivals and sporting events, during warm weather months. Since March, all such events have been cancelled in Maryland,\" wrote lawyers representing candidates for the Green Party and Libertarian Party.\n\nThe lawsuits led to settlement agreements where the state lowered the required signatures from 10,000 to 5,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nIn a rare case of bipartisan litigation, two Democrats and one Republican candidate for Congress requested that the state make it easier for candidates to gather signatures to get their names on the primary and general election ballots.\n\n\"These candidates simply do not have the ability to collect the required numbers of signatures from voters unable to leave their homes and advised to limit contact with others,\" their lawyers wrote.\n\nA judge agreed, ordering the state to reduce the number of signatures required by 50%, allowing candidates to submit electronic signatures supporting their candidacy and extending the deadline to submit all signatures.\n\nVoters with \"print disabilities\" also scored a victory when a lawsuit they filed led to an agreement with the state that expanded their access to vote. The plaintiffs included people who are blind, have low vision or suffer from mobility or dexterity problems that make it impossible for them to read, write, hold or manipulate paper documents.\n\nUnder the agreement, the state will allow the voters to request a ballot and cast their vote by email using existing technology that assists the visually impaired.\n\nMichigan\n\nAfter the National Federation for the Blind filed a lawsuit claiming its members could not fill out paper absentee ballots on their own, U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain ordered the state to provide them with a manner to fill out their ballots using \"screen reader technology\" that is commonly used for other kinds of reading.\n\nSeveral groups filed challenges to the state's deadline to receive absentee ballots by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The groups argued that COVID-19 restrictions coupled with reported delays in the U.S. Post Office could lead to thousands of ballots being thrown out for arriving late. They cited the fact that at least 6,405 absentee ballot arrived too late during the August primary, and Trump won the 2016 election by 10,704 votes.\n\nA state Court of Appeals panel rejected those requests, arguing that the state has made enough accommodations for absentee voters.\n\n\"When choosing to submit an absentee ballot by mail, one assumes the risk that the ballot will not arrive by the deadline (any deadline), or even arrive at all,\" the judges wrote.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWith Minnesota moving to more mail-in voting, multiple lawsuits requested the state extend the Election Day deadline to receive absentee ballots and to eliminate the requirement that a witness sign each absentee ballot.\n\nThe challenges were filed by elderly residents worried about bringing an infected person into their home and college students studying in other states worried about their ballots arriving on time. One lawsuit noted that 40% of Minnesotans over 65 live alone and that Black and Indigenous voters are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 because of their underlying conditions.\n\nThe Republican Party tried to intervene in one of the cases to block any changes, but a judge denied them and accepted a settlement agreement that granted most of the requests.\n\nUnder the deal finalized in July, absentee ballots were to be accepted if they were postmarked by Election Day and received by election officials within a week, and ballots would no longer require a witness signature.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Thursday that the agreement violated the U.S. Constitution because the secretary of state's acceptance of the agreement \"extended the receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.\"\n\n\"Simply put, the Secretary has no power to override the Minnesota Legislature,\" which enacted the Election Day deadline for receiving ballots, the court ruled.\n\nThe three-judge panel sent the case back to the district court with instructions to issue a preliminary injunction requiring compliance with the original deadline. Ballots received after Election Day are to be set aside and preserved, the ruling said.\n\nThe ruling acknowledged that the nearly last-minute injunction \"may create harm in terms of voter confusion.\" However, the court said, \"inevitable post-election challenges to the counting of invalid ballots if no injunction is granted is even more problematic since it would give voters no opportunity to adjust their mailing time or to deliver their mail-in ballots on Election Day to obviate their risk.\"\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in Minnesota is challenging the requirement that people wear masks in polling locations. The nonpartisan Minnesota Voters Alliance argued that state law makes it a crime to wear a mask in public, but the state is requiring masks at voting locations, forcing people to violate one law or another in order to vote.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz rejected that argument, writing that the state’s ban on masks was first enacted in 1923 to limit the rise of the Klu Klux Klan and was \"clearly\" designed to prevent people from purposefully concealing their identity. Wearing a mask in the midst of a global pandemic, the judge ruled, does not violate that law.\n\n\"The statute makes it unlawful to wear disguises,\" the judge wrote.\n\nMississippi\n\nVoting absentee has never been easy in Mississippi, and civil rights groups say that's by design.\n\n\"Mississippi has some of the most restrictive burdens on absentee voting in the nation that run afoul of the constitution and have a particularly stark impact on Black voters,\" said Jennifer Nwachukwu, attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law.\n\nMany states allow any voter to cast an absentee ballot, but in Mississippi, voters have to fall into a list of \"excuses\" to do so. One of the allowable reasons is for a \"temporary or permanent physical disability,\" but judges and legislators have made clear that exception does mean everyone can use the COVID-19 pandemic as reason to vote absentee.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature recently amended the law to state that a \"temporary physical disability\" includes any voter who is \"under a physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19 during the year 2020 or is caring for a dependent who is under a physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19.\" And last month, the Mississippi Supreme Court dismissed a request that people with underlying medical conditions be allowed to vote absentee.\n\n\"Having a preexisting condition that puts a voter at a higher risk does not automatically create a temporary disability for absentee-voting purposes,\" the court ruled.\n\nMontana\n\nThree key lawsuits significantly altered the way Montanans vote in November.\n\nIn one case, a group of Native American tribes requested that a judge strike down a state law that limits the number of ballots that one person can deliver on behalf of others. The groups argued their members live in isolated areas with high levels of poverty, making a trip to a polling station or even a mailbox can be incredibly difficult.\n\nState District Court Judge Jessica Fehr agreed, ruling that the state law created too large a burden on Native American voters.\n\n\"The questions presented cannot be viewed through the lens of our own upbringings or own life experiences, but through the lens of the cold, hard data that was presented at trial about the clear limitations Native American communities in Montana face,\" Fehr wrote.\n\nIn another case filed by the Democratic Party, a judge extended the Election Day deadline for absentee ballots, allowing all votes postmarked by Election Day to be counted.\n\nAnd in a third case, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party requested that a judge block Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s order allowing for universal mail-in voting. The GOP argued that the order was a \"brazen power grab\" that opens the election to \"fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Christensen – an Obama appointee – called the Republicans' claims \"a fiction.\"\n\n\"When pressed during the hearing in this matter, the Plaintiffs were compelled to concede that they cannot point to a single instance of voter fraud in Montana in any election during the last 20 years,\" Christensen wrote.\n\nNevada\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a lawsuit challenging a law passed by the state’s Democratic legislature and signed into law by the Democratic governor that expands absentee voting in the November election.\n\nTrump's attorneys argued that the changes were rushed into law and would lead to \"chaos\" in election offices. U.S. District Judge James Mahan – appointed by President George W. Bush – struck down the lawsuit, ruling that the Trump campaign did not have standing to challenge the state law.\n\n\"The Trump campaign does not represent Nevada voters,\" Mahan wrote. \"The Trump campaign represents only Donald J. Trump and his 'electoral and political goals' of reelection.\"\n\nSimilar lawsuits were filed by Sharron Angle, a Republican who failed in her 2010 U.S. Senate campaign, and a group of citizens who argued that an all-mail election would lead to the collapse of the state and the nation's \"republican form of government.\"\n\nA judge struck down each lawsuit, ruling that protecting the health of citizens was paramount in the midst of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican Party scored a win in the Granite State when a judge refused to extend the Election Day deadline for absentee ballots.\n\nA teacher’s union filed a lawsuit challenging the election system implemented by the state’s Republican governor and Democratic legislature. The union argued that the 5 p.m. Election Day deadline and the requirement that a witness sign all absentee ballots posed a challenge to its members, many of whom are older and at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\nSuperior Court Judge William Delker struck down those requests, ruling that the state has already taken steps to make it easier to vote absentee this year and that witness signature requirements are needed to ensure the validity of each ballot. As for the Election Day deadline, Delker wrote that: “Voters have ample time to request, complete, and return their registrations and/or ballots prior to the election.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe Trump campaign and local Republicans filed several lawsuits challenging the decision by New Jersey’s Democratic governor and Democratic-led Legislature to transition to a mostly mail-in vote in November in the name of public health.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the campaign cited several instances of alleged voter fraud in New Jersey, including a case in Paterson where a campaign worker admitted to investigators that she stole ballots out of mailboxes. The lawsuit charged that those cases reveal the risks of absentee voting and would dilute the \"legitimate votes of honest citizens.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Shipp, an Obama appointee, disagreed, ruling that the Trump campaign did not show that the previous, isolated cases of fraud meant that widespread fraud in the November election was \"inevitable.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, a judge granted a request that voters be allowed an opportunity to correct alleged mismatches between the signature on their absentee ballot and the signature on file with the state. The judge ordered all county election offices to notify those voters within 24 hours and give them time to verify their vote.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTwenty-seven of the 33 county clerks in Democratic-leaning New Mexico filed a lawsuit in March arguing that they couldn’t responsibly hold the state’s June primary election because so many of the regular polling stations were closed at the time because of the pandemic.\n\nThey requested the state move to all-mail voting. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court granted them a partial win, allowing them to send absentee ballot registrations to all voters but requiring them to maintain some polling locations open for in-person voting.\n\nNew York\n\nDisability Rights New York and other organizations and individuals filed a federal lawsuit seeking an order for the state to provide voting alternatives for disabled people who are fearful of voting in-person due to the coronavirus pandemic. The groups represent people living with blindness, low vision and physical disabilities such as paralysis.\n\n\"Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs because their service, program, or activity of absentee voting is inaccessible,” the lawsuit alleged.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case include Rasheta Bunting, a registered voter in Brooklyn. She has low vision and does not have sufficient eyesight to read, mark and sign a standard print ballot without assistance, the court complaint said.\n\nThe two sides agreed to a settlement approved by a judge. The state will order county election boards to distribute \"an accessible fillable PDF absentee ballot\" that people with print disabilities can use to vote in the primary election. The parties later agree on a settlement to implement a similar program for the November election, where voters with print disabilities will receive a form \"that is screen readable using common assistive technology.\"\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIn 2020, North Carolina election lawsuits featured challenges over witness requirements for voter signatures on absentee ballots, giving voters an opportunity to correct problems with their absentee ballots, and other issues.\n\nBut the most-watched case focused on whether voters would win extra time to have their absentee ballots received and counted.\n\nThe state’s election board agreed on Sept. 22 to accept mail-in votes postmarked by Nov. 3 that arrive before Nov. 12. That represents a six-day extension of the previous Nov. 6 deadline set by state lawmakers. The board also agreed to provide more opportunities to correct deficient absentee ballots and add absentee ballot drop-off locations.\n\nThe leaders of the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature asked a federal court judge to throw out the agreement. They argued that the board was administering the 2020 election “in an arbitrary and nonuniform manner.”\n\nA federal judge granted a temporary restraining order that blocked state election officials from continuing to use the expanded voting plan. On Oct. 14, another judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction, arguing that it was too late to overhaul the voting process, \"even in the face of what appear to be clear violations\" of state election procedures. The ruling allowed the extended voting plan to continue.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reviewed the legal arguments in a proceeding that consolidated multiple cases. In the 12-3 ruling issued on Oct. 20, the appeals court refused to grant a preliminary injunction that would have overturned the extended voting plan.\n\nTrump's election campaign asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review and reverse the appeals court decision. However, the high court denied the application Wednesday in a ruling that let the extended deadline stand.\n\nBarrett did not participate in the ruling, the court said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nSelf Advocacy Solutions, the League of Women Voters of North Dakota and a voter filed a constitutional challenge to the state’s system for verifying voter’s signatures on mail-in ballots. They alleged that the people who perform the comparisons aren’t trained properly.\n\n“The State rejects hundreds of ballots cast by eligible North Dakota voters every election because of this unreliable ballot verification process, disproportionately disenfranchising voters prone to signature variability, specifically people with disabilities, non-native English speakers, and both young and elderly voters,” the court complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cited the experience of Maria Fallon Romo, a regular voter and resident of Grand Forks who has voted by mail and assumed her votes had been counted. They were not.\n\n“Ms. Romo was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1997. As a result of her MS, it is difficult for her to write neatly or consistently,” the court complaint said. “Ms. Romo did not know that a signature on her ballot application that did not ‘correspond’ with the one provided on her ballot could invalidate her ballot, particularly without any notice to her beforehand.”\n\nBoth sides in the case agreed to a permanent injunction that requires county voting officials to notify voters if the signature on their ballots don’t match with the ones on file. The officials are required to first try calling the voter, then mailing them a notice, and giving them time to verify the signature before the state locks in final vote tallies six days after Election Day.\n\nOhio\n\nThe A. Philip Randolph Institute of Ohio, an organization of African American trade union members, filed a federal court constitutional challenge to Ohio's one drop box per county for accepting completed absentee ballots. Citing an expected torrent of absentee votes during the coronavirus pandemic, the lawsuit said “absent immediate injunctive relief, hundreds of thousands of Ohioans stand to have their votes suppressed” because of the Ohio secretary of state’s decision “depriving Ohioans of a sufficient number of secure drop boxes.\"\n\nThe court ultimately issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the institute. \"The Secretary has not advanced any legitimate reason to prohibit a county board of elections from utilizing off-site drop boxes and/or off-site delivery of ballots to staff,” the court ruled.\n\nA split decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of appeals stayed the injunction. Federal courts should not micromanage state election processes, the judges ruled, citing a 2016 federal court ruling.\n\nOklahoma\n\nA Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee complaint filed in federal court challenged what it called \"onerous and unnecessary\" election law requirements for notarization and witnessing of ballots, photo IDs for voters, lack of prepaid postage for mail ballots and other rules that the committee said would make voting more difficult during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe court ruled that the state had created alternatives for voters to file absentee ballots without direct contact with others. Dismissing the case, the ruling also said \"the state’s interests in preventing voter fraud and promoting certainty and confidence are sufficiently weighty to overcome any minor burden imposed upon Oklahoma voters during the pandemic.\"\n\nOregon\n\nA community organization called People Not Politicians sought a ballot initiative that would amend the state constitution to assign the redistricting maps for the state Senate, House and U.S. House of Representatives seats to an independent commission. The coronavirus pandemic made it difficult for the organization to get the signatures required to qualify for this year’s ballots. A federal district court granted an injunction that reduced the number of required signatures and extended the filing deadline.\n\nThe state sought a stay of the ruling. After the district court denied the application, the case ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which imposed a stay and agreed to consider the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the stay made the case moot, because the Supreme Court would likely not decide the issue before the deadline to place the initiative on Oregon ballots.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is among a few states that proved crucial to Trump’s 2016 victory. Widely viewed as a swing state again this year, Pennsylvania has been the site of multiple 2020 election law challenges, and a U.S. Supreme Court announcement six days before Election Day in a closely watched case.\n\nThe lawsuit features Democratic Party officials’ challenges to several provisions of state election laws. They sought rulings on whether election boards may establish drop boxes to receive completed ballots, whether the deadline for receiving mail ballots by 8 p.m. on Election Day could be changed during the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Postal System delivery problems and other issues.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that county election boards could receive mail ballots at drop boxes and other locations other than the boards’ main offices. Citing USPS delivery problems and the crush of voters using mail ballots during the coronavirus pandemic, the court also ruled that election boards could accept mail ballots by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, a three-day extension from the deadline set by state lawmakers. The court denied an application for a stay filed by state Republican officials.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on whether to consider two applications for stays of the decision. That let the lower court ruling stand. Pennsylvania Republicans returned to the U.S. Supreme Court late last week with an application for expedited consideration of a full review by the nation's highest court.\n\nThe court denied the motion on Wednesday without Barrett taking part. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that there was insufficient time to decide the issue before Election Day.\n\nAlito, referring to the state court's decision to alter the mail ballot deadline set by the state Legislature, wrote that the issue \"has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution.\"\n\nAlito left the door open to further action by the high court as it continues to weigh a full review of the matter. He raised the possibility that the court could order Pennsylvania ballots received after Election Day be segregated from other ballots for further consideration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nGovernment watchdog Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and individual voters filed a constitutional challenge to the state requirement that voters who submit absentee ballots must have them notarized or signed by two people who witnessed the voter’s signature. The lawsuit alleged the requirement was an undue burden on voters during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBoth sides in the case reached a consent agreement suspending enforcement of the law for the 2020 primary election and Nov. 3 national election. The Republican National Committee intervened and moved for a stay on the consent agreement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the motion, in part because no Rhode Island elected officials voiced public opposition to the settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, South Carolina voters and the state’s Democratic Party challenged the constitutionality of several election laws. The provisions restrict mail voting in some cases by age, require a witness signature on ballot envelopes, require proper postage for mail ballots, limit who can help a voter return a mail ballot and reject ballots received after 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement on the postage issue. The district court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction that enjoined the state from enforcing the witness signature policy for the 2020 election but denied relief on other issues.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court granted in part an application for a stay of the ruling on Oct. 5. The action reimposed the witness signature requirement, but exempted ballots already filed or received within two days of the high court’s action.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed with the stay because decisions about safety and health should be left to politically accountable officials in the states.\n\n“Second, for many years, this court has repeatedly emphasized that federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election rules in the period close to an election,” Kavanaugh wrote. “By enjoining South Carolina’s witness requirement shortly before the election, the district court defied that principle and this court’s precedents.”\n\nTennessee\n\nA Tennessee state court lawsuit challenged election laws that place restrictions on who is eligible to vote by absentee ballot.\n\nThe case was filed earlier this year on behalf of plaintiffs who are immunocompromised or who have other ailments that could make them vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nThe court granted an injunction that temporarily required the state to provide absentee ballots to any eligible Tennessee voter who applies to vote by mail due to concern about contracting or transmitting the disease.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Tennessee said the ruling went too far. Ruling in August, the court said that only people who have special vulnerability to COVID-19 or who provide care for those with that vulnerability should qualify for absentee ballots.\n\nOverturning the lower court's injunction, the state Supreme Court ruled that the \"state’s interests in the efficacy and integrity of the election process are sufficient to justify the moderate burden placed on the right to vote of those\" who don't have particular vulnerability to the coronavirus.\n\nTexas\n\nState or federal courts in the Lone Star State handled more than 20 election-related legal challenges during 2020.\n\nOne case alleged that Gov. Greg Abbott's one-per-county limit on ballot drop-off locations would \"unreasonably burden\" citizens' ability to vote and force them to \"risk exposure to COVID-19.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman, who was nominated to the federal bench by Obama, ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction. The public interest would be best served by “ensuring that qualified absentee voters, who comprise some of the most vulnerable citizens in Texas, can exercise their right to vote and have that vote counted.”\n\nHowever, a three-judge panel of judges nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by Trump reversed Pitman’s ruling and upheld Abbott's order. \"The district court vastly overstated the 'character and magnitude' of the burden allegedly placed on voting rights ... Indeed, one strains to see how it burdens voting at all,\" the judges ruled.\n\nLeaving Abbot’s order in place “still gives Texas absentee voters many ways to cast their ballots in the November 3 election,” and “abridges no one’s right to vote,” the judges ruled.\n\nVermont\n\nFive voters, three of them present or former government officials, sued the Vermont secretary of state over a statewide election directive issued in July designed to send absentee ballots to all registered voters.\n\nThe lawsuit argued that the directive would inevitably send some ballots to people who have moved or died. People who are otherwise ineligible to vote may cast some of the ballots, the lawsuit also alleged.\n\nU.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford in September denied a motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case on grounds that the people who sued lacked legal standing to represent all Vermonters. \"Of all people likely to be confused about how to vote, these five plaintiffs must be last on the list,\" Crawford wrote.\n\nVirginia\n\nA member of the National Federation of the Blind of Virginia joined other disabled voters in challenging what they alleged was the state's failure to provide accessible vote-by-mail options to voters who are blind, have low vision or who suffer from impaired manual dexterity.\n\nA partial settlement agreement reached in August requires the state to help voters like these by providing them with screen reader assisting technology that enables them to electronically receive and mare absentee ballots.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington is one of 14 states that sued Trump and the U.S. Postal Service over operational changes to mail processing and handling that slowed deliveries of regular mail, prescriptions and packages. State officials said the changes could slow applications for absentee ballots, as well as filings of the completed ballots.\n\nIn September, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the Postal Service from continuing to use the changed workplace instructions. The injunction requires the Postal Service to use \"extraordinary measures\" to speed deliveries of election ballots.\n\nThe court is continuing to review the postal system's performance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWest Virginia’s Democratic Party challenged the state's decades-old system of deciding which party’s candidates are listed first on ballots, arguing the procedure gave an unfair edge to the first candidates listed. They submitted evidence from a political psychologist who calculated the advantage at 2.94%.\n\nThe system uses the results of the most recent presidential election to decide which candidate slate gets listed first for the succeeding four years. That means that Trump and other Republicans will be listed first.\n\n\"To award candidates from a favored political party an extra 2.94 percentage points in an election would be blatantly unconstitutional. To do the same through the allocation of ballot position without a weighty justification is also unconstitutional,” wrote U.S. District Judge Robert Chambers in an August ruling that permanently enjoined the West Virginia secretary of state’s office from using the protocol.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit subsequently granted a stay that enabled the state to continue using the system while a full appeal of the ruling continues.\n\nWisconsin\n\nA major U.S. Supreme Court ruling just over a week before Election Day will affect some voters who file absentee ballots in Wisconsin, a state Trump narrowly won in 2016 and that is viewed as a swing state again this year.\n\nBy a 5-3 vote, the high court let stand a lower appeals court decision that means absentee ballots must be received by local boards of election by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The decision dealt the final legal blow to an earlier federal district court ruling that the boards would have to accept absentee ballots as long as six days after the elections.\n\n\"Elections must end sometime, a single deadline supplies clear notice, and requiring ballots be in by election day puts all voters on the same footing,\" wrote Gorsuch, with a concurrence by Kavanaugh.\n\n\"The Constitution provides that state legislatures – not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials – bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,\" wrote Gorsuch.\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY; Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer; Jon Campbell, USA TODAY Network New York; Jimmie Gates, The Clarion-Ledger; Clara Hendrickson, Detroit Free Press; John Kennedy, Gannett Florida Capital Bureau; Dylan Segelbaum, York Daily Record; Mariah Timms, The Tennessean; Ben Tobin, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story erroneously listed several court rulings in Arizona.

The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/27/congress-debt-ceiling-funding-issues-before-year-end/6374543001/", "title": "Congress: Debt ceiling, funding, other issues to tackle before year-end", "text": "WASHINGTON – When Congress returns from Thanksgiving break, it will have a slate of legislative items it must pass – and others it may try to push through – by the calendar-year's end.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress will work in overdrive to try to avoid a government shutdown and default, both of which would be catastrophic for an economy grappling with the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/11/boarding-school-stories-underwater-festival-secret-museum-living-news-around-states/50476947/", "title": "Boarding school stories, underwater festival, secret museum living ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: Abnormally dry weather in north Alabama may have ruined corn plantings and is damaging other crops. “The hot, dry weather has just hit the corn at the absolute worst time,” said Brady Peek, who farms approximately 1,800 acres in western Limestone County. “We’ll be lucky if we even have a corn crop. Yields are going to be significantly below average.” Ashley Ravenscraft, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Huntsville, said portions of Lawrence and Morgan counties have been characterized as “abnormally dry” since June 21. In Limestone County, 60% of the county has been in a moderate drought since June 28. From June 21 through last Monday, Decatur received only 0.24 inch of rainfall, and Moulton had 0.53 inch, Ravenscraft said. Athens, she said, had 1.78 inches of rain in that span, but she attributed the higher number to pop-up showers the past several days. Ravenscraft said the average rainfall in July is 4.49 inches. “Typically, around this time of year you’re getting some kind of rainfall from either tropical systems or your summertime storms or a weaker disturbance that will come through and produce some rain. This is typically one of our wettest months out of the year,” she said.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: A family had given up hope of finding their blind, elderly golden retriever who wandered away from their home three weeks ago, but a construction crew found Lulu in salmonberry bushes after initially confusing her for a bear. Lulu was barely alive after being found Tuesday, but she is being nursed back to health at home with her family, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “She means everything,” owner Ted Kubacki said. “I have five daughters, and they’re 4 to 13 years old, so they’ve spent every day of their life with that dog.” The Kubacki family searched for weeks after Lulu wandered off June 18. “She’s just so helpless, and you kind of imagined that she can’t get real far because she can’t see,” he said. It didn’t help when the family was the subject of a terrible joke when someone claimed they found Lulu a few days into the search. “We put the kids to bed and got a text saying, ‘We found your dog,’ or ‘I have your dog,’ and we’re like, ‘Oh my god, this is incredible,’ ” he said. “Then the person texted me, ‘Just kidding.’ This happened, yeah; that was all part of this terrible story.” Once Lulu did make it back, Kubacki, a grocery store employee and sole provider for his family of seven, then worried about the veterinarian’s bill. But his fears were unfounded, as Sitka residents donated hundreds of dollars to cover Lulu’s recuperation bills.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney with the state attorney general’s office told a judge Friday that a 2021 “personhood” law that gives all legal rights to unborn children can’t be used to bring criminal charges against abortion providers. The comment from Assistant Solicitor General Kate Sawyer came during a hearing where attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and an abortion rights group representing abortion providers were seeking an injunction blocking the law. They said abortion providers are worried that prosecutors will bring charges for crimes like assault and child abuse under the law, which U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes declined to block last year. That decision came before the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 24 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that said women have a right to seek an abortion. The battle over Arizona’s “personhood” law – one of several in Republican-led states that aim to grant all rights to fetuses – is playing out despite all abortions being halted in the state. Arizona providers stopped providing the procedure because of concerns that a pre-1901 law that bans all abortions may now be enforceable, as Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich declared June 29. That law has been blocked since 1973, but Brnovich has vowed to go to court to remove that injunction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana and scale back casino gambling submitted thousands of signatures Friday in the hopes of getting their proposals on the Arkansas ballot. Friday was the deadline for groups to turn in the signatures needed to qualify for the November election. Proposed constitutional amendments need at least 89,151 valid signatures from registered voters. The proposal’s ballot title and popular name will also need to be approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners. More than 192,000 signatures were submitted for the recreational marijuana proposal to allow people age 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis. Arkansas voters in 2016 voted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. More than 103,000 signatures were submitted for the other proposed amendment to repeal part of a casino gambling amendment voters approved in 2018. The proposal would remove Pope County as one of the counties where a casino is allowed. Casinos have already been set up in the three other counties spelled out in the 2018 measure. State officials will check the petitions to determine whether enough valid signatures were submitted or if the groups qualify for an additional 30 days to collect signatures.\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: A wildfire threatening the largest grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park more than doubled in size in a day, and firefighters were working in difficult terrain Sunday to protect the iconic trees and a small mountain town. Campers and residents near the blaze were evacuated, but the rest of the sprawling park in California remained open, though heavy smoke obscured scenic vistas and created unhealthy air quality. “Today it’s actually the smokiest that we’ve seen,” Nancy Phillipe, a Yosemite fire information spokesperson, said Sunday. “Up until this morning, the park has not been in that unhealthy category, but that is where we are now.” More than 500 mature sequoias were threatened in the famed Mariposa Grove, but there were no reports of severe damage to any named trees, including the 3,000-year-old Grizzly Giant. A sprinkler system set up within the grove kept the tree trunks moist, and officials were hopeful that the steady spray of water along with previous prescribed burns would be enough to keep flames at bay, Phillipe said. The cause of the Washburn Fire was under investigation. It had grown to nearly 2.5 square miles by Sunday morning, with no containment. Beyond the trees, the community of Wawona, which is surrounded by parkland, was under threat, with people ordered to leave late Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis barred state agencies Wednesday from arresting or extraditing anyone seeking or providing reproductive care in Colorado, where the right to abortion was codified in state law this year. Polis issued an executive order that prohibits state agencies from cooperating with out-of-state civil or criminal investigations related to seeking, obtaining or providing reproductive health care – unless the alleged activity would be illegal in Colorado. The Democratic governor also ordered the Department of Regulatory Agencies to develop rules designed to protect licensed professional workers who could face disciplinary action or the loss of a professional license due to potential sanctions imposed by another state. Polis’ order comes as other liberal governors vow to fight out-of-state law enforcement actions following the Supreme Court’s June decision to revoke the constitutional right to abortion. Polis also directed state agencies to work to “protect people and entities who are providing, assisting, seeking, or obtaining reproductive health care in Colorado.” Colorado was the first U.S. state to decriminalize abortion in 1967, and Polis this year signed into law a bill codifying that right.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The family of a Black man paralyzed when a police van without seat belts braked suddenly asked federal authorities Friday to file civil rights charges against the officers involved. The driver was taking Randy Cox, 36, to a police station in New Haven on June 19 for processing on a weapons charge when he braked hard to avoid a collision, police said, causing Cox to fly headfirst into the wall of the van. His family said he remains paralyzed from the chest down. Cox’s mother, two sisters and civil rights attorney Ben Crump spoke before meeting with U.S. Department of Justice officials in New Haven on Friday, arguing that Cox’s constitutional rights were violated. “You ask yourself, was it cruel and unusual punishment to put him in the back of that police transportation van with no seat belt, knowing that if you’re speeding, if you slam on the brakes, that somebody is going to be seriously injured?” Crump said. Cox’s supporters say the police mocked his cries for help and accused him of being drunk. Video shows the officers dragged him by his feet from the van and placed him in a holding cell at the police department before paramedics finally took him to a hospital. Cox remains hospitalized and unable to speak because of his breathing tube. Hundreds of protesters led by Crump, members of Cox’s family and the local NAACP staged a march Friday evening in New Haven to the city’s police headquarters.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man convicted earlier this year of a felony hate crime for what authorities say was the persistent harassment of a Black female employee in Gov. John Carney’s office has been sentenced to four months in prison. Matthew Gregg will also be required to complete community service, anger management, and mental health and substance abuse counseling. The 27-year-old Hockessin man was arrested Dec. 10, 2020, on charges of harassment and terroristic threatening. According to court documents, Gregg called the receptionist in Carney’s office 160 times between Nov. 20 and Dec. 10, 2020. In those calls, Gregg targeted the woman with racist and sexist slurs, according to court documents. Gregg also threatened to kill the receptionist and throw a brick at the governor’s head, according to the Department of Justice’s sentencing memorandum. Deputy Attorney General Nicole Mozee wrote that Gregg was upset about COVID-19 mandates Carney put in place but that none of his calls to the governor’s secretary actually protested those mandates. The Department of Justice argued that not sentencing Gregg to time in prison would unduly depreciate “the severity of the offense.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that $2 million will be invested in order to improve the quality of school breakfast in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. Additionally, there will be an expansion of schools participating in the school breakfast program with 104 public and public charter schools across the district, according to a press release. State Superintendent Christina Grant said not every eligible food-insecure student participates in the program. “We are excited to support schools in increasing student participation in the school breakfast program, leading to increases in health and academic outcomes,” Grant said. Nearly 18 local education agencies that serve students from pre-K through 12th grade and have a population where at least 75% have eligibility for free or reduced-price meals were awarded school breakfast grant funds from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education. “With this investment, we can support more families, get more students connected to the student breakfast program and build healthier classrooms and communities,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nBig Pine Key: They weren’t in a “Yellow Submarine,” but hundreds of people spent time below the waves Saturday for a music festival off the Florida Keys. The Beatles hit and other ocean-themed songs like the theme to “The Little Mermaid” were part of the entertainment during the Lower Keys Underwater Music Festival. The divers and snorkelers, many dressed as mermaids and sea creatures, enjoyed music played through waterproof speakers dangling from boats floating above the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The festival took place at Looe Key Reef, about 6 miles from Big Pine Key. The event at the continental United States’ only living coral barrier reef raised awareness on how divers can protect the reef by not touching corals or leaving litter underwater, using mooring buoys instead of anchoring when boating, respecting dive flags, and other ways of minimizing environmental impacts. Participants swam among marine life and coral formations and described the music as ethereal, a bit muted, but emanating from all directions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state could have more than $5 billion in surplus revenue after the just-concluded budget year, following another big month for tax collections in June. The state Revenue Department announced Friday that it collected more than $33 billion in taxes in the year ended June 30, up 23% from about $27 billion the year before. Georgia planned to spend more than $54 billion in the just-ended budget year, including federal money, lottery proceeds, and other fees and taxes that state agencies collect. Lawmakers boosted that number by $4.5 billion during a midyear budget revision that included bonus payments and pay raises for state employees and teachers but will still substantially undershoot total revenue for the year. Final numbers won’t be clear until the state closes it books on the budget year, which usually happens around Labor Day. The bulging bank account could allow the state to further cut taxes or expand services. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has already extended a temporary waiver on gas taxes through the middle of August, and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has been calling on Kemp to extend the gas tax holiday through the end of the year. Kemp can make that move as long as lawmakers later ratify it.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor ordered the U.S. and state flags to be flown at half-staff to honor former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, calling the assassinated ex-leader a friend of the islands. Because flags were already at half-staff honoring victims of an Independence Day parade shooting near Chicago, Hawaii Gov. David Ige said the flags would be lowered in Abe’s memory from sunrise to sunset Sunday. Abe, 67, was assassinated on a street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign speech – an attack in a nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere. Police at the shooting scene arrested Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, a former member of Japan’s navy, on suspicion of murder. “This senseless act of violence has taken the life of a true friend of Hawaii,” Ige said in a statement. “In our multiple meetings, we shared stories of our past, embraced our common culture, and continued the quest for reconciliation and partnership that has developed between the United States and Japan.” Ige’s flag order applies to the Hawaii State Capitol, state offices and agencies, and the Hawaii National Guard.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A site targeted with antisemitic vandalism last month is now slated to get a mural supporting human rights. Boise Parks and Recreation Director said the city’s Department of Arts & History would be tasked with handling the mural in a tunnel next to the Idaho Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, the Idaho Press reports. The graffiti left on the site in December was part of a string of antisemitic incidents in the city in recent years, according to the newspaper.\n\nIllinois\n\nWheaton: A former suburban Chicago man sought for 22 years after fleeing the country to avoid trial on a charge of concealing a homicide has been captured and returned to DuPage County, prosecutors said Friday. Romulo Mendoza, 46, was arrested last month trying to reenter the U.S. on the southern border, the DuPage County State’s Attorney’s Office said without specifying the location. He appeared Thursday before a judge, who set his bond at $1 million. On Feb. 4, 2000, Mendoza and two roommates, Carmelino Gomez and Pedro Garcia, were allegedly drinking alcohol in their Bensenville home and began arguing over an electricity bill. Gomez grabbed Garcia from behind and put his arm around his neck, killing him, authorities said at the time. Gomez and Mendoza allegedly then loaded the body in a car and dumped it at a rural location, where a passerby discovered it the next day. The two were arrested two days later. After posting $2,000 bond on May 31, 2000, Mendoza failed to appear for his next court date. Gomez pleaded guilty in September 2000 to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has allowed an Indiana law largely banning a second-trimester abortion procedure to take effect following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge Sarah Evans Barker’s order signed Thursday lifted the injunction she issued in 2019 blocking the state law against the dilation and evacuation abortions. The law took effect immediately, according to the state attorney general’s office, and is the first tightening of Indiana’s anti-abortion laws since the Supreme Court decision. Indiana could have more sweeping abortion restrictions by next month, as the Republican-dominated Legislature is scheduled to begin a special legislative session on July 25. Barker granted a request from the Indiana attorney general’s office to lift her order, writing that the Supreme Court’s decision in June overturning the 1973 landmark ruling that made abortion legal nationwide removed the “linchpin holdings” for her analysis. The Republican-backed legislation prohibits doctors from performing what it calls “dismemberment abortion” except to prevent serious health risk or save the woman’s life. A doctor violating the law could face a felony charge, punishable by up to six years in prison.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two police officers are taking the unusual move of suing six people who participated in a 2020 protest in Des Moines after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, accusing them of assault. All six people were arrested during the July 1, 2020, protest, and five already pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of assault on a police officer and/or interference with official acts. One of them, Indira Sheumaker, was later elected to the Des Moines City Council. The lawsuit, first reported by Axios Des Moines, was filed by Peter Wilson and Jeffrey George as individuals and not as representatives of the Des Moines Police Department. They are seeking an unspecified amount for actual and punitive damages. It will likely be met with skepticism by the court, said Robert Bloom, a professor at Boston College Law School, who noted that the claims of assault and battery appear to be applying criminal complaints to a civil action. Experts also note that Iowa is among several states that have adopted what’s known as the “fireman’s rule,” which holds that firefighting and policing are inherently dangerous jobs and generally bars emergency responders from suing or collecting damages for injuries that occur in the course of their duties.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A gubernatorial drought declaration covers the entire state, and for the first time, the 2022 annual Kansas Water Authority report acknowledged the role of climate change while recommending mitigation and adaptation strategies. Internationally, climate scientists warn of a “code red for humanity.” As farmers harvest a drought-ravaged wheat crop after a heat wave killed cattle, discussion of what governments can do to help remain divided over the role of climate change. Bipartisan support exists for adapting to persistent droughts, water shortages and wildfires, but there is less appetite to make mitigating climate change central to the government response. In Topeka, the Legislature authorized a special water committee to meet in the coming months. The move comes after an overhaul of the state government’s approach to water issues was watered down. The Kansas wheat harvest is more than halfway done, USDA reports show, putting it ahead of schedule. Wheat farmers expect a largely drought-induced drop in yield of 100 million bushels, equating to more than $1 billion in lost production. An abnormally dry winter and spring meant much of the state’s what crop did not get the precipitation it needed. More recent rains in May and June came too late for most fields to make a difference.\n\nKentucky\n\nBarbourville: A school district has banned middle and high school students from using backpacks, saying the move is meant to address safety concerns. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that Knox County Schools will implement the policy when students return to school in August. School spokesperson Frank Shelton says the policy will prevent students from using a bag to conceal items. “That is one less method that a student has to bring something into the building,” Shelton said. “With school safety on the minds of many due to recent school and public gathering shootings, we hope that our students and families see this as one more measure we are taking to protect students.” The policy will not apply to elementary school students.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state can now enforce its ban on almost all abortions under a judge’s order issued Friday amid a flurry of court challenges to state “trigger” laws crafted to take effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The decision came the same day President Joe Biden issued an executive order to protect access to abortion in states where it is still legal and mitigate the potential penalties women seeking the procedure may face after the high court’s ruling June 24. Days after the Supreme Court decision, Louisiana District Judge Robin Giarrusso issued a temporary restraining order banning enforcement of the state legislation in response to a lawsuit filed by a north Louisiana abortion clinic and others. State District Judge Ethel Julien said Friday that she did not have the authority to extend the restraining order because she had concluded the suit should not have been filed in her court. She said the suit’s claims that provisions in the law are unconstitutionally vague and inconsistent are matters involving legislation and therefore should be heard in state court in the capital, Baton Rouge. The ruling was a victory for Attorney General Jeff Landry and lawyers for the state, who argued that the lawsuit had been improperly filed in New Orleans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government hasn’t done enough to protect a rare species of whale from lethal entanglement in lobster fishing gear, and new rules are needed to protect the species from extinction, a judge has ruled. The government has violated both the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act by failing to protect the North Atlantic right whale, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled Friday. The whales number less than 340 in the world and have been declining rapidly in population in recent years. Boasberg’s ruling was a victory for conservation groups that have long sought to save the whale and a new challenge for lobster fishermen who have fought back against tightening restrictions on where and how they can fish. Boasberg ruled that the court’s findings “do not dictate that it must immediately shutter the American lobster fishery” but instead said the parties must propose potential remedies to the threat faced by whales. The ruling “may seem a severe result for the lobster industry” and the government, but no one “operates free from the strict requirements imposed by the MMPA and ESA,” Boasberg wrote. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, while some members of the fishing industry took a more measured approach.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: The U.S. Army says it is making progress in the long-running effort to address groundwater contamination at part of Fort Detrick that was used as a test site for the Army’s biological warfare program. The Army has been studying the groundwater problems on and around the “Area B” portion of the Maryland base for over a decade. Joseph Gortva, chief of Fort Detrick’s Environmental Management Division, recently told the Frederick News-Post he is “cautiously optimistic” the Army will complete field work at the site within the next two years. It will likely take another year or two beyond that for officials to finish a report summarizing what they’ve learned, the newspaper reports. Then the Army would move to the “feasibility study” phase of the cleanup. That would involve evaluating potential methods of addressing the contamination. The cleanup process for the site’s groundwater has been in the “remedial investigation” phase since 2010, the newspaper reports. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated the Area B groundwater as a Superfund site. Most drinking water wells near Fort Detrick have been closed, according to the newspaper.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: A fire ripped through a historic landmark on Nantucket on Saturday morning, leaving the centuries-old structure heavily damaged. Firefighters battled the blaze that tore through the Veranda House inn, which dates back to the late 17th century. The inn is located in downtown Nantucket. Multiple firefighters from around the Cape Cod area headed to the island to help battle the flames, the Yarmouth Fire Department said on Facebook. Firefighters were still working to suppress the fire as of noon Saturday, Nantucket police tweeted. People were urged to avoid the area. Massachusetts State Police sent troopers to assist Nantucket authorities with the investigation, David Procopio, a state police spokesperson, told The Boston Globe. Photos and videos posted online showed smoke billowing into the sky above the downtown area. About 185 customers were without power because of the fire at about 8:45 a.m., according to National Grid. All but seven had their power restored by 11 a.m. The inn, which was built in the late 1600s, boasts 18 rooms and suites, according to its website.\n\nMichigan\n\nSturgis: Production of baby formula has resumed at the Abbott Nutrition factory whose February shutdown over contamination contributed to a national shortage, a company spokesman said. Damage from severe thunderstorms including flooding had forced the Sturgis plant to halt operations in mid-June, just two weeks after restarting production with additional sanitizing and safety protocols. Production of EleCare, a specialty formula for infants with severe food allergies and digestive problems, was restored at Sturgis following a July 1 reboot, said Abbott spokesman John Koval. “We are working to restart Similac production as soon as we can. We’ll provide more information when we have it,” he said via email. Abbott recalled several leading brands of formula in February, including Similac. That squeezed supplies already been strained by supply chain disruptions and stockpiling during COVID-19 shutdowns. The shortage was most dire for children with allergies, digestive problems and metabolic disorders who rely on specialty formulas. President Joe Biden’s administration has since eased import rules for foreign manufacturers, airlifted formula from Europe and invoked federal emergency rules to prioritize U.S. production.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A program that allows people to cross into remote areas of Canada without reporting to border officials is expected to resume in the coming days. The Canada Border Services Agency told Minnesota Public Radio News that it has notified stakeholders that the program will restart soon and that the reopening date will be posted on its website once it has been confirmed. Resuming the program that was suspended in May 2020 as COVID-19 took hold will provide an economic boost to resorts and businesses in northern Minnesota, including those that offer canoe trips into Quetico Provincial Park. The park’s website said that the program was set to resume Friday and that the Canadian border agency would begin to accept applications in the coming weeks. The suspension of the remote permits for more than two years has had “a huge impact on us and the Boundary Waters,” said Mike Prom, co-owner of Voyageur Canoe Outfitters at the end of the Gunflint Trail. It will likely be a few weeks before canoeists begin crossing the border into Quetico, Prom said, since it typically takes about three weeks to receive the permits in the mail. He said travelers may also be able to drive to the border to get permits.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A man has been indicted on a murder charge a year after a former legislator was shot to death while she was doing yard work in a rural area where her sister-in-law had died. Republican former state Rep. Ashley Henley, 40, was killed in June 2021 outside the burned-out mobile home where her sister-in-law, Kristina Michelle Jones, was found dead in December 2020. Henley and other relatives contended Yalobusha County authorities were doing too little to examine possible criminal charges in Jones’ death. Relatives erected a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark said Henley had been mowing grass at the home site before she was killed. A man who had lived near Jones, Billy Lamar Brooks, was indicted in February on a charge of maliciously setting fire to the home of Jones and Terry Henley. Court records show that on June 30, a grand jury filed a new indictment against Brooks to add a murder charge in the death of Ashley Henley. The Associated Press reached Brooks’ attorney, Bradley Peeples, by phone Saturday, and he declined to comment on the case. Court records show Brooks made a court appearance Thursday, and Circuit Judge Smith Murphey set his bond at $250,000.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s Board of Aldermen has given initial approval to creating a $1 million fund to help St. Louis women get abortions in other states in the wake of a near-total state abortion ban that went into effect June 24. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the measure passed Friday would allocate federal American Rescue Plan Act funds for transportation, child care and other logistical help for women who travel to states where abortion remains legal. A vote on final passage is set for this week. Alderman Joe Vaccaro opposed the plan and called it a political stunt that will tie up some of the city’s pandemic aid funds in a lengthy court fight. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt already has said he will sue to try to block the measure and one proposed in Kansas City to use city employee health insurance to help with employee travel for out-of-state abortions. Schmitt, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Roy Blunt, said the St. Louis ordinance would violate a state law barring public money from being used to perform or assist an abortion not needed to save the life of the mother. Supporters say the money would only be used to provide access to abortion.\n\nMontana\n\nYellowstone National Park: It could take three to five years to replace roads damaged by flooding last month in Yellowstone National Park, but temporary fixes are expected to be in place within months, park Superintendent Cam Sholly said Friday. Sholly spoke after surveying damaged areas of the nation’s first national park with U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. The flooding prompted the evacuation of more than 10,000 people from the park and prompted its temporary closure. Parts of Yellowstone and two of its five entrances remain closed. Haaland also met with Gov. Greg Gianforte to tour flood damage in Gardiner, Montana. The town is a gateway to Yellowstone and dependent on its tourism but was cut off when the road into the park washed out in flooding that began June 12. A temporary road from Gardiner to the park headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs has been built for essential travel and some guided tours. It potentially could be opened to visitors before winter, park officials said. A similar temporary fix is planned for washed out roadway at the park’s northeast gate near Cooke City, Montana. Federal officials have offered $50 million in emergency funding for the work.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Republicans fired their longtime party chairman at a tumultuous state convention that highlighted divisions within the party driven by activists who support ex-President Donald Trump and want to take the party further to the right. After convention delegates voted to remove Chairman Dan Welch on Saturday, most of the other state party leaders resigned, including Executive Director Taylor Gage, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Republicans were sharply divided during this spring’s gubernatorial primary battle between two conservative candidates: the eventual winner, Jim Pillen, and businessman Charles Herbster, who was endorsed by Trump. The race to replace Gov. Pete Ricketts, who couldn’t run because of term limits, became more controversial after eight young women accused Herbster of groping them. Herbster denied the allegations, describing them as a politically motivated attack. He filed a defamation lawsuit against one of his accusers, state Sen. Julie Slama, who responded with a lawsuit of her own accusing Herbster of sexual battery. Herbster has refused to endorse Pillen, who is still expected to win in November over Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood because the state strongly favors Republicans.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A couple was found secretly keeping a cache of weapons and living with their two kids at a children’s museum where they worked, authorities said. A janitor at the Children’s Museum of Northern Nevada was arrested late last week, KRNV-TV in Reno reports. The 41-year-old man has been charged with child neglect and endangerment and possession of a suppressor and a short-barrel rifle. Authorities discovered the arsenal in a storage room, they said. A police report listed an AK-47 rifle, three handguns, a pistol, ammunition, knives and a Taser that could have been reached by a child. The stash also included drug paraphernalia like a bong and a used marijuana joint. Officials realized the family was living in the museum after the man’s 2-year-old child was spotted walking nearby unsupervised, the Carson City Sheriff’s Office said. It was not the first time police interacted with the man over his child being left alone. But this time, the toddler’s older sister gave deputies the museum as their address. Authorities, along with a museum board member, then walked through the property and saw signs people had been living there. Sleeping bags, mattresses, clothes and food were among the items found in areas off-limits to visitors, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: Joseph Raymond Goulet, a veteran who landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, on D-Day, has died. The New Hampshire resident died July 4. He was 99. Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to parents who emigrated from Canada, Goulet voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, according to an obituary. His math and organizational skills led him to the Army Service Forces – now the Army Quartermaster Corps. When Army officials realized that Goulet spoke and read French fluently, he was sent to the Army’s 1st Infantry Division to use those language skills to connect with local French leaders and help open routes to the Army’s objectives inland following the invasion. On June 6, 1944, he landed with the first wave of the 1st Infantry Division at Omaha Beach but never ended up having to use his French language skills. During the rapid advance toward Germany, Goulet drove trucks loaded with fuel, ammunition and other needed supplies to the advancing front lines. He became part of what became known as the “Red-Ball Express,” which ran truck convoys nonstop regardless of the enemy, the weather or other obstacles. After the war, he worked at several jobs in the electrical supply industry before retiring and relocating permanently to New Hampshire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The New Jersey Economic Developmental Authority announced Friday that it will allocate $17.5million in grants to 30 nonprofits across the state to support restaurants and families through the latest phase of its Sustain and Serve NJ program. The program, launched in December 2020, offers grant funding to nonprofit organizations who purchase meals from New Jersey restaurants that have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizations then distribute these meals at no cost to those in need to help address food insecurity across the state. The program has allocated $52.5 million over three phases to eligible organizations that have purchased more than 3.5 million meals from more than 400 restaurants from every county in New Jersey, according to the press release. Gov. Phil Murphy allocated $10 million from the federal American Rescue Plan and about $7.5 million from the state to fund Phase 3 of the program. To be eligible for the Phase 3 grant, applicants must be a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(19) nonprofit organization that demonstrates the capacity to purchase at least 1,500 meals meals in bulk costing at least $25,000 from New Jersey restaurants. They also must demonstrate increased costs during the pandemic, among other criteria to be eligible for the funding.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Months after the withdrawal of legislation that proposed the Navajo Nation recognize marriage equality through repealing and amending tribal laws, a new bill is bringing back that recommendation. The legislation seeks to end the ban on same-sex marriage under the Diné Marriage Act and repeal the section of the Navajo Nation Council resolution from 2005 that forbids couples of the same gender from marrying on tribal land or having their marriage recognized. The bill also proposes to amend other provisions in tribal law to conform with the repeal, including those that address spousal rights to property and employee benefits under the tribal government. Delegate Eugene Tso recently introduced the legislation. It is now eligible for consideration by four standing committees, then the Navajo Nation Council. Tso sponsored the previous bill but abruptly withdrew his sponsorship in April, citing the need to retool the legislation amid mixed reaction from delegates and the public. In an interview July 1, Tso said he wants the bill to go to the council at the summer session.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo improperly used state resources for a book he received $5.1 million to write, according to a report by a law firm. New York’s soon-to-be-disbanded ethics commission, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, voted Thursday to make the report public. It had sought the investigation by the law firm to learn more about how the book deal was approved and the role played by the commission itself. The report says the ethics commission failed to assert itself as a watchdog agency against the governor and should have asked for more information from Cuomo’s office. Cuomo had already written 70,000 words of what was expected to be an 80,000-word book before he submitted a request seeking approval by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics for the book in 2020. That meant Cuomo wrote and publicized the book at a time when it interfered with his responsibilities as a governor leading the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. In December, the commission ordered Cuomo to turn over money from his book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” Cuomo has filed a lawsuit accusing the commission of violating his rights and showing bias against him.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court will accelerate appeals over the constitutionality of a law that gave adults with child sexual abuse claims another two years to seek civil damages. A majority of justices agreed last week to hear the case of three former Gaston County student-athletes who are suing a coach who was convicted of crimes against team members, as well as the county school board, rather than let the intermediate-level Court of Appeals rule first. A divided panel of three trial judges dismissed the lawsuit last December, ruling unconstitutional a portion of the law that revived for two years only – 2020 and 2021 – the ability of someone otherwise too late to sue for child sexual abuse claims. Before the 2019 law called the SAFE Act, such abuse victims effectively had until age 21 to file such a lawsuit. The plaintiffs appealed. In a 4-3 decision announced Tuesday, the Supreme Court decided the case should bypass the Court of Appeals. The court’s registered Democrats composed the majority. Chief Justice Paul Newby, writing a dissent for the three Republican justices, said they would have allowed Court of Appeals review first and lamented that multiple bypass motions have been allowed by the court over the past few months in other cases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Dozens of teachers from around the state got a cultural education from American Indian tribes last week. More than 250 educators attended the North Dakota Indian Education Summit on Thursday and Friday at the Capitol in Bismarck, where they participated in breakout sessions and took in cultural presentations, such as Native American dancing in traditional regalia. Some of the breakout sessions included teaching Indigenous culture successfully in today’s schools and implementing Native American topics into schools’ curriculum. “I think it’s important that we learn about the diversity of our students and have a better understanding of where they’re coming from and gain the knowledge they have so much to give back to us as educators,” said teacher Tami Hauglie. One of the summit’s objectives is to unify the education system in North Dakota to bring different cultures together, organizers said. Courtney Davis Souvannasacd, an outreach coordinator with the National Resource Center on Native American Aging at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, told KFYR-TV it wasn’t until later in her life that she was exposed to cultural ceremonies. “And so I still I have a lot to learn,” she said. “And I’m just happy that my children are able to experience that new environment that is open, welcoming, and inclusive of that where I try to chip away at obstacles or barriers that might be in the way, and it’s not always easy.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A former Cincinnati City Council member was convicted Friday of federal charges of bribery and attempted extortion but was acquitted on four other counts. Democrat P.G. Sittenfeld, 37, had maintained his innocence against allegations that he agreed to accept $40,000 in payments to his political action committee to “deliver the votes” in the City Council for a proposed downtown real estate development. He had been considered a top contender to run for mayor before he was indicted in November 2020. “We’re obviously very disappointed; that’s about all I can say right now,” Charlie Rittgers, Sittenfeld’s attorney, said as he left the courthouse. “P.G., well he’s crushed. He’s crushed.” It’s not yet known if Sittenfeld will appeal the verdict or what type of sentence he’s facing. The jury got the case Wednesday afternoon and deliberated more than 12 hours over three days before reaching its mixed verdict. Sittenfeld was found guilty of single counts of bribery and attempted extortion but was acquitted of two counts of honest services wire fraud and single counts of attempted bribery and extortion. Sittenfeld dipped his head and slumped forward in his seat after hearing the verdict, while his wife and at least one other woman in the packed courtroom started to cry.\n\nOklahoma\n\nAnadarko: Native American tribal elders who were once students at federal Indian boarding schools testified Saturday about the hardships they endured, including beatings, whippings, sexual assaults, forced haircuts and painful nicknames. “I still feel that pain,” said 84-year-old Donald Neconie, a former U.S. Marine and member of the Kiowa Tribe who once attended the Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. “I will never, ever forgive this school for what they did to me. It may be good now. But it wasn’t back then.” As the elders spoke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, herself a Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history, listened quietly. The event at the Riverside Indian School, which still operates today but with a vastly different mission, was the first stop on a yearlong nationwide tour to hear about the painful experiences of Native Americans who were sent to the government-backed boarding schools. Although most closed their doors long ago, and none still exist to strip students of their identities, some still function as schools, albeit with drastically different missions that celebrate the cultural backgrounds of their Native students. Among them is Riverside, one of oldest, which opened in 1871.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Backers of a proposed initiative that would require people to secure permits to buy firearms say concern about recent mass shootings have buoyed their effort, and they have enough signatures to place it on the November ballot. The Rev. Mark Knutson, a chief petitioner of the initiative, delivered signatures Friday afternoon to the Oregon secretary of state’s office in Salem, accompanied by students and other volunteers. Election officials, who work under Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, will verify that the signatures are from registered voters. Proponents of the measure say they’ve seen surging interest in the possible November ballot question following recent mass shootings, and they hope the move to put the gun issue before voters catches fire in other states. “Let’s go across the nation and go from grief and despair and mourning,” Knutson said. “We just need to take action. If people are afraid, if neighbors are being shot, if our children are in fear – if we don’t take action, what are we doing?” The initiative supporters needed to deliver at least 112,080 registered voters’ signatures by the Friday deadline to get on the ballot, Knutson said. Proponents say they delivered 161,545 signatures. It would ban large-capacity magazines over 10 rounds – except for current owners, law enforcement and the military – and require a permit to purchase any gun. The state police would create a firearms database.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday rejected three bills passed by the Republican-majority Legislature, vetoing measures regarding transgender athletes in school sports and poll watchers. He also struck down the Human Services Code, blowing a hole in the state budget as lawmakers were trying to finish the annual flurry of votes that accompany the annual spending plan. Wolf had previously warned he would strike down the bill to prohibit transgender athletes from playing sports that align with their gender identity. In his veto message, he said the bill would have “a devastating impact on a vulnerable population already at greater risk of bullying and depression.” He also vetoed a bill – sponsored by Franklin County Sen. Doug Mastriano, the GOP’s nominee for governor – to let all registered voters of Pennsylvania serve as poll watchers in any precinct in the state. “This bill does nothing to increase access to voting,” he wrote. “Instead, this bill undermines the integrity of our election process and encourages voter intimidation.” Wolf’s third veto was based on a provision in the Human Service Code that would have prohibited a state agency from contracting with a vendor of financial management services.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A national women’s rights organization is fighting back against the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling through federal court in the state. The Elizabeth Cady Stanton Trust has filed a lawsuit asking the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island to recognize the Equal Rights Amendment as a valid and enforceable 28th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, thus affirming women’s equal rights under the law. “We hope that the little state of Rhode Island will make the biggest decision in the history of women’s rights. The timing has never been more urgent,” said Wendy Murphy, a longtime ERA strategist who works with the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Trust. The lawsuit is one of three the organization filed after the Supreme Court’s draft ruling overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked. The group, named for Stanton, a leading women’s rights activist in the 1800s, filed similar lawsuits in Michigan and New York, all with the aim of getting the courts to establish equal protection under the law regardless of sex. “The goal of the lawsuit is to get the Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution,” said Murphy, a co-director of the Women’s and Children’s Advocacy Project at New England Law.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Pastor John Gray of Relentless Church was hospitalized Thursday night with a saddle pulmonary embolism, according an Instagram post by Gray’s wife, Aventer Gray. “My family and I stand in need of a miracle,” Aventer Gray wrote in her post. A saddle pulmonary embolism is a rare type of blockage of an artery in the lungs that can be life-threatening, according to the National Library of Medicine. “To place this in perspective,” Aventer Gray posted, “the doctor said that people have come into the hospital dead with this exact scenario (John) walked in with.” Along with the embolism, Aventer Gray wrote that more blood clots were also found in her husband’s lungs. She wrote that he will need to undergo two types of surgery due to the pressure on his heart. John Gray came to Greenville in 2018 from Houston, Texas, where he served as an associate pastor under megachurch leader Joel Osteen. Gray took over the Redemption Church congregation and buildings and rebranded the church as Relentless Church when Redemption pastor Ron Carpenter announced he was moving his ministry to California. The post sparked an outpouring of support from members of Gray’s congregation, other faith leaders and celebrities alike.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Skateboarders and their fans dropped into downtown Sioux Falls for the national skateboard festival Innoskate over the weekend. Innoskate, created in 2013 by USA Skateboarding and the Smithsonian’s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, celebrates the intersection of invention and creativity in skate culture, according to the Smithsonian. Crowdgoers were treated to panels during Saturday’s activities on Native American skateboarding culture on the Pine Ridge Reservation, what diversity and inclusion looks like in skateboarding, and discussions about skateboarding in the Olympics. There were also trick competitions and skateboard workshops. “Pine Ridge is literally the mecca of skateboarding,” said Kyle Mesteth, 36, who founded the Ground Control Skate Park on the reservation. “You could just travel within an hour and hit four skate parks.” Mesteth spoke about how important skateboarding has become on the reservation and how he has watched it grow since he started skateboarding in the mid-1990s. One of the first skateparks on the reservation, the Toby Eagle Bull Memorial Wounded Knee Skate Park, opened in 2011. “We see a very bright future for our skaters because of the skate park,” he said. “We see results because of it.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city’s hospitality and tourism industry experienced a bounce-back last year, with the hotel occupancy rate and total visitors returning to near pre-pandemic figures, according to Memphis Tourism’s annual report. The nonprofit organization often touts 2019 as a record year for the local industry. Then in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered that promising trajectory for hospitality and tourism due to restrictions that decreased national and international visitation. In addition to the usual tourist draws like Graceland and the National Civil Rights Museum, 2021 also saw the return of a scaled-back Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. While COVID-19 restrictions remained in place for large parts of 2021, the availability of vaccines and loosening of local restrictions, along with other factors, saw the optimism from the end of 2019 return for those in hospitality and tourism. “Everybody saw the dramatic impact and how important the visitor economy is to a community,” Memphis Tourism CEO Kevin Kane said. “Everybody is really anxious to get that back as soon as they can.” More than 4.1 million hotel rooms were sold in Shelby County, or about 93% of the total hotel demand from 2019. Memphis outpaced the national average by about 5%.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The mayor on Friday disputed a new report that alleges authorities missed chances to quickly end the massacre at an elementary school, again reflecting the lack of definitive answers about the slow law enforcement response to one of the deadliest classroom shootings in U.S. history. Mayor Don McLaughlin said that no Uvalde police officer saw the gunman outside Robb Elementary School before he went inside and that none of them had an opportunity to fire on the shooter. His comments contradict a critique of the decision-making by law enforcement that was released last week by tactical response experts at Texas State University. The differing accounts and public rebuke of the report reiterated how, more than six weeks after the May 24 shooting, questions remain about how and why police armed with rifles and bulletproof shields waited more than an hour before confronting the gunman in a fourth grade classroom where 21 people were killed, including 19 children. It also widened a rift between Uvalde officials and the state, particularly the Texas Department of Public Safety, which had troopers on the scene and has directed much of the blame to the local school district police chief.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city, already a draw for outdoors enthusiasts, is opening a new trail this week, and officials say they expect it could help fight crime, too. The Temple Springs Trail, which will connect 700 East to Red Hills Parkway along the cliffside on the north end of the central part of the city, is set for an official opening Wednesday. The trail is open to pedestrians and cyclists and adds to the city’s growing network of multiuse trails. This particular trail was not initially in the city master plan but was later approved by the City Council after it was picked as a potential location, said Joe Nelson, the city’s parks and planning landscape architect. The project was brought to the city’s attention by the St. George Police Department, which had dealt with crime and homelessness in the area, Nelson said. “It was a kind of magnet for homeless camps and just kind of crime,” Nelson said. “It was a kind of a hot spot for that. The police had a really hard time getting into the site to surveil it, and so they were the ones that actually said, ‘Hey, we need to clean up this site and put a trail through it so we can have eyes on the site.’ ” A grand opening will be held at 9 a.m. Wednesday. Parking will be available east of the water tank in two parking lots, and biking is also encouraged.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 21-year-old man died after he was shot in the head, police said Friday, as the city contends with an increase in gun violence in recent years. The shooting took place about 7:40 p.m. Thursday in the Old North End neighborhood. No suspects were in custody, but police said they believed that the parties knew each other and that the shooting was not random. Police identified the victim as Hussein Mubarak, of Burlington. After the shooting, police were told the suspect may have fled north into a wooded area. A search by police that included dogs and a drone was unsuccessful. In a statement, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said the shooting death was the first homicide in the city in more than two years. “Yet it is one of many recent gunfire incidents, part of a very disturbing trend that has dramatically increased since 2020,” Weinberger said. Last month, Weinberger, city police and the county prosecutor said reducing gunfire episodes in Vermont’s largest city was a top priority. At the time, city officials said there had been nearly 40 instances of gunfire in the city since the beginning of 2020. Previously, the city averaged about two a year.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The state’s first casino has opened for business in a temporary space inside a former shopping mall. The Bristol Casino will be open 24/7, offering 870 slots, 21 tables and a sportsbook. A line of customers wrapped around the building as they waited for Friday’s grand opening, TV station WDBJ reports. “We had to come and save my sister from spending all her money,” Christiansburg resident Cheryl Hubbard told the station. “And spend all of his,” she joked, pointing to her husband. In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation to allow developers to build large casino resorts in five cities – Norfolk, Bristol, Portsmouth, Danville and Richmond – in what supporters billed as a way to boost struggling economies. Potential operators had to first clear a voter referendum. That happened in every city but Richmond, which rejected the initiative last year. But city officials have mounted an effort to bring the issue back a second time. Bristol voters overwhelmingly approved their referendum, and the project got its license earlier this year. Developers eventually plan to open a $400 million resort and Hard Rock casino, with a hotel, restaurants, bars and lounges, and a concert venue. The full-scale project is expected to open in 2024 and employ 1,200 people.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Commission on Judicial Conduct has admonished a King County District Court judge for implying in court that a defendant would be raped in prison if he didn’t change his behavior. The Seattle Times reports Judge Virginia Amato, who was elected in November 2018, presided over the arraignment of a man charged with misdemeanor domestic violence assault and resisting arrest last August, according to the stipulation, agreement and order of admonishment signed June 24 by the commission’s executive director, J. Reiko Callner. Before imposing conditions of release, Amato noted the man’s alleged crimes happened while he was on probation, the order says. The man had no felony convictions and could not be sent to prison for misdemeanors, yet Amato is quoted in the order as telling him he was setting himself up “to be Bubba’s new best girlfriend at the state penitentiary.” “That may hopefully give you a graphic image to think about … and if you think I’m kidding, I’m not,” she reportedly said. A confidential complaint was filed in October with the commission, which is responsible for reviewing and acting on complaints of judicial misconduct, and Amato was served with a statement of allegations in December, the order says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Recovery Point West Virginia held its grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday for the Point Cafe, Huntington’s newest community resource center. The Point Cafe opened after a few years of planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reginald Jones, Recovery Point’s executive director, said officials originally applied for a grant in 2019 from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to fund the cafe at a different location, but a “year of unavailability” led to the project coming to fruition later than expected. Now that the cafe is open, Jones said the location will be a safe space and a free, therapeutic environment for anyone seeking recovery to find resources, make connections and join support groups. The cafe will offer a variety of workshops and classes, including art and yoga. He said the cafe will also be a resource for the greater community of Huntington by holding cooking, financial literacy and computer courses; conducting barista training; and offering resume-building assistance, among other services. “The idea came to us as an organization, Recovery Point, from looking at what the needs are of the community and trying to find a niche to fill those gaps,” Jones said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A divided state Supreme Court ruled Friday that parents suing the Madison School District over its gender identity policies must disclose their names to opposing attorneys, but they don’t have to be revealed to the district or be made public. The 4-3 ruling comes after a Dane County Circuit Court judge in 2020 temporarily suspended portions of the district’s guidance on gender identity that a group of unnamed parents and a conservative law firm sued to overturn. The case centers on a policy the district adopted in 2018 that calls for district personnel to call students by their preferred names and pronouns but not to disclose students’ gender identities to anyone outside, including their parents. Some parents sued in 2020, alleging the policy violates their right to parent their children as they see fit and their right to religious freedom. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom, both conservative law firms, are representing the parents. The firm’s attorneys asked Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington to allow them to proceed without revealing the parents’ names out of fear they would be subject to retaliation and harassment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Energy companies bid more than $22 million to secure drilling rights on about 110 square miles of public lands in the West late last month, during the first onshore oil and natural gas lease sales since President Joe Biden took office. Leases on about 90 square miles went unsold in the U.S. Bureau Land Management online auctions that included parcels of federal lands in seven states. Oil and gas produced from the leases will be subject to a royalty rate of 18.75%. That’s up from 12.5% and the first royalty increase since the 1920s. Most of those sold were in Wyoming, where companies paid more than $13 million for parcels totaling about 105 square miles. The auctions came as federal officials try to balance efforts to fight climate change against pressure to bring down high gas prices. Critics of the leasing program pointed to unsold parcels in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Nevada as further evidence oil companies have enough leases and drilling permits already stockpiled to last them for years. But with several prior lease sales still tied up in court challenges from environmentalists, some companies had concerns going into the sale that they might not be able to drill on leases they acquired, said Ryan McConnaughey, vice president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/vote-in-wisconsin-election-results-and-updates-polling-places-voting-sites/6130134002/", "title": "Voting in Wisconsin: Updates from polling places and election results", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin staff members are out in force this week to keep you informed on this historic election.\n\nFollow our regular updates, from scene-setting at the polls on Tuesday to results and reaction as races are called.\n\nResults:Statewide results, county breakdowns and more\n\nMore:Why Wisconsin election results weren't final on Tuesday\n\nFull coverage:Wisconsin election section\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n10:05 a.m.: Reaction starting to pour in after Wisconsin votes blue\n\nSeveral celebrities posted on social media Wednesday, commenting on Wisconsin's vote totals revealing a win for Joe Biden in the presidential election.\n\nThat included Kenosha native Mark Ruffalo, whose presence in the preceding months including collaborating on a pro-voting commercial in the state and speaking to community members following unrest in his hometown.\n\nOn the CBS \"Late Show,\" host Stephen Colbert pointed out that the state is now full of \"Blue Cheeseheads.\"\n\n\"So they smell weird, but they taste great crumbled on a salad made with poached pear and candied walnuts.\"\n\nDaniel Bice of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel pointed out winners and losers of the election, including a winner in Assembly Speaker Robin Vos.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n4:11 p.m.: Despite Rudy Guliani's false claim, ballots did not just materialize\n\nSpeaking at a press conference that aired on Fox News, Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Guliani, falsely said that about 120,000 ballots just mysteriously showed up in Wisconsin about 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. — part of “a concerted effort of the crooks that run the Democrat Party.”\n\nTrump's team has announced it will pursue legal action to stop vote-tallying in Pennsylvania because of lack of transparency and has already expressed desire for a recount in Wisconsin, a state declared for Joe Biden earlier Wednesday.\n\nClaims similar to Guliani's have made the rounds citing irregularities in the Wisconsin election, unfounded claims that are debunked by Politifact.\n\n3:53 p.m.: Voter confusion in Glendale solved with an assist from ... Georgia's Stacy Abrams\n\nGlendale resident Larry Sandler submitted his absentee ballot last week at Glendale City Hall but later discovered his ballot wasn’t marked as received online, he said in a Facebook post.\n\nSandler, a former reporter with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said he was informed of his voting status after receiving a robocall from Stacy Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate. The call included the comment that according to records, Sandler hadn't yet voted.\n\n“I called Glendale City Hall, and fortunately they were able to find my ballot and promise me it would be counted,” he said.\n\nGlendale City Clerk Megan Humitz was out of office on Election Day after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. City Administrator Rachel Safstrom said she was unable to speak on Sandler’s situation, but it is possible that the check-in step on WisVote could be missed.\n\n“This step missed does not mean the ballot would not be processed at the polls,” Safstrom said in an email. “It just means they could not see it was processed online.”\n\nSafstrom said if a person drops off an absentee ballot at the polls on Election Day, it wouldn’t go to the clerk, but would be processed at the polls, and part of the final reconciliation logged in by the clerk’s office.\n\n“If any resident contacted us with concern we would locate the ballot,” Safstrom said. “Residents can always review their voting record on MyVote. Final reconciliation for this election will be completed in the upcoming weeks.”\n\nSafstrom said there were several residents who cited ballot issues, only to find out they believed the website’s status meant that the resident received the ballot, but not the municipality.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n3:40: Rock band R.E.M. salutes Wisconsin with songs from classic Madison show\n\nShortly after The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election Wednesday, R.E.M offered a \"nod\" to the state — and shared old songs recorded in Madison.\n\nThe left-leaning band — which officially broke up in 2011, but still maintains social media channels — shared a YouTube link on Twitter to recordings of a couple of songs from a 1982 set at Madison club Merlyn's, of \"Catapult\" and \"Radio Free Radio.\"\n\n\"A nod to Wisconsin from the mists of time … ,\" read the accompanying tweet.\n\nWisconsin being called for Biden brought the Democratic challenger closer to achieving the needed 270 electoral college votes to clinch the presidency. Biden received about 20,000 more votes in Wisconsin than President Donald Trump, but the Trump campaign said it would call for a recount.\n\n— Piet Levy\n\n3:35 p.m.: Despite ballot glitch, Outagamie County avoids delays\n\nThousands of misprinted ballots led to many additional hours of work for poll workers in Outagamie County on Election Day but didn't lead to any significant delays in counting votes.\n\nThe municipalities with the most misprinted ballots had enough poll workers to handle the workload, Outagamie County Clerk Lori O'Bright told The Post-Crescent on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"I am very pleased with how hard everyone worked,\" O'Bright said. \"It was amazing, so I appreciate all the hard work of our municipalities and their poll workers.\"\n\nThe last results in Outagamie County were reported about 2 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe misprint was visible in a black square — known as a timing mark — near the edge of the ballots. It was small, but still large enough that machines used to scan ballots weren't able to accurately read them.\n\nTo make sure those votes were still counted, poll workers had to duplicate the ballots by transferring votes to a new ballot that could be read by machine. The process required two workers and typically takes about four minutes per ballot.\n\n— Chris Mueller\n\n2:12 p.m.: Two intriguing District Attorney races\n\nTo no real surprise, the Waushara County District Attorney who abandoned her job just two months after appointment by Gov. Tony Evers, lost her bid to keep the job via election.\n\nAnd In Iron County, incumbent DA Matthew Tingstad defeated a challenger who got in the race this summer after questions arose about whether Tingstad ever moved to Wisconsin from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan after his election in 2016.\n\nHis opponent, Doug Muskett, was another Upper Michigan lawyer, who said he made a point of moving across the Montreal River to Hurley even before the election, though he could legally run as a Michigan resident, just like Tingstad had.\n\nMuskett got well more than the needed 200 write-in votes during an August primary to get on Tuesday's ballot as a Democrat.\n\nBut in the election, Tingstad, running as a Republican in a county went heavily for President Donald Trump, beat Muskett by less than 1,000 votes, 2,398 to 1,506.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n2:01 p.m.: Milwaukee leaders praise Election Commission effort\n\nMilwaukee leaders on Wednesday applauded the work of the city’s Election Commission to prepare and execute Tuesday’s election, which required processing almost 170,000 absentee ballots and took place as the state’s coronavirus cases have been rising at an alarming pace.\n\nIn April, as the pandemic was ramping up, the city made national headlines for the challenges its voters faced in casting their ballots. At that point, the city was hemorrhaging poll workers and opened only five polling locations on Election Day.\n\nThat wasn’t the case Tuesday, when the city opened 173 neighborhood-based polling sites. It also had 15 absentee ballot drop boxes and more than a dozen early in-person voting locations.\n\nResults from the city’s nearly 170,000 absentee ballots were taken from Central Count in downtown to the Milwaukee County Courthouse about 3 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n“I want to say a huge thank you to Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg, her staff, all election workers and volunteers,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett tweeted late Wednesday morning. “I’m grateful to everyone who worked around the clock yesterday and into the morning to get our ballots processed as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said Woodall-Vogg and her staff worked hard in the months leading up to Tuesday to organize a safe election in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nMilwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson said in a statement that the city “put forth an historic infrastructure this election to ensure that all residents could vote safely and securely during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nJohnson, who worked a shift at Central Count, credited Woodall-Vogg with putting together an efficient, smooth operation to accurately count absentee ballots.\n\n“I applaud Ms. Woodall-Vogg, Election Commission staff, and all of the poll workers and volunteers who worked into the night to sustain our democratic process of free and fair elections,” he said. “As a city we are very proud and grateful for your service.”\n\nUnder Wisconsin law, the city could only begin counting absentee ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Central Count workers worked in shifts to process all of the absentee ballots.\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley on Wednesday afternoon also thanked those who worked and volunteered in Tuesday’s election – and the months leading up to it.\n\nAnd he thanked county residents for voting.\n\n“More people participating in the process and exercising their right to vote is a testament to the level of engagement across Milwaukee County and across the political spectrum, and to all those who helped make sure the COVID-19 pandemic did not get in the way of democracy,” he said in a statement. “These are the true heroes of the election process and we are forever grateful for their tireless work.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n1:33 p.m.: Associated Press officially calls Wisconsin for Biden\n\nThe Associated Press declared Democrat Joe Biden the winner in Wisconsin on Wednesday, after the state once again went down to the wire in the presidential election.\n\nUnofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes, and the Trump campaign in a statement already vowed it would request a recount.\n\nBiden's lead is very close to Trump's winning margin in 2016 over Hillary Clinton.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in the early morning hours when the City of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead.\n\n— Read full story from Craig Gilbert and Patrick Marley\n\n1:24 p.m.: Results from lone outstanding Wisconsin precinct slowed by missing clerk\n\nJust one Wisconsin precinct hasn’t reported voting totals, and county election officials in the area say they don’t know when they’ll know the results.\n\nRichland County Clerk Victor Vlasak said the Willow township clerk went home sick from the polls on Tuesday, and he hasn’t been able to reach her or anyone in the township.\n\nVlasak said the clerk typically would provide voting totals by phone on Election Day. That didn’t happen and he said he can't find her or anyone there to answer questions or bring in ballots from the single polling location in the township.\n\n\"I don’t know what we’re going to do … we need those numbers,\" he said.\n\nVlasak, who has been clerk since 1988, said this is the first time he hasn't received a call from all polling locations with voting totals. He said everyone is due to bring election materials to his office by 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nHe said he’s concerned about going to the clerk’s home because she is sick.\n\n— Molly Beck\n\n11:53 a.m.: Scott Walker points out unlikelihood of recount impacting result\n\nNo stranger to close elections, former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker pointed out that a recount in Wisconsin would have a tall order in overcoming a 20,000-vote spread.\n\n\"After recount in 2011 race for WI Supreme Court, there was a swing of 300 votes,\" Walker tweeted. \"After recount in 2016 Presidential race in WI, @realDonaldTrump numbers went up by 131. As I said, 20,000 is a high hurdle.\"\n\nWalker lost his re-election bid in 2018 by 29,000 votes, an outcome outside the margin of 1% that allowed for a recount. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin in 2016 by 22,748 votes, a tally that gained ground after a recount requested by the campaign of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.\n\nRELATED:Trump campaign vows to seek recount as Wisconsin election officials say Joe Biden has 20,000-vote margin\n\nBiden appears to have won Wisconsin by a margin of 20,517 votes, with all precincts reported. It is within the 1% margin to allow for a recount if requested, which the Trump campaign has said it will pursue.\n\n— JR Radcliffe\n\n11:33 a.m.: Officials say all votes are counted, and Biden has 20,000-vote lead\n\nAfter all the upheaval of the past year and the drama and turmoil of President Donald Trump's first term, Wisconsin once again went down to the wire in the 2020 election, with Democrat Joe Biden holding a lead of around 20,000 votes, according to unofficial returns.\n\nThat is very close to Trump's winning margin in 2016.\n\nBiden overtook Trump in early morning hours when the city of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic. Then late returns from Green Bay and the city of Kenosha added to his slender lead.\n\nTrump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\nMeagan Wolfe, the director of the state Elections Commission, told NBC News on Wednesday that all ballots have been counted, though the results have not yet been made final.\n\nRead the full story from Craig Gilbert.\n\n10:35 a.m.: Both Biden, Trump campaigns taking notice of Wisconsin's thin margin\n\nThe campaigns of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden are taking notice that Wisconsin could be headed for a recount because of its thin margin.\n\nTrump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters Wednesday that Wisconsin was in “recount territory,” just hours after Trump said he wanted all vote-counting to stop even though many legally cast ballots around the country had not yet been tallied.\n\nIn its own call with reporters, Biden aides said the former vice president was confident he would keep his lead in Wisconsin even if there is a recount. They said they believed Biden would secure the last Electoral College votes he needs as the outstanding states finalize their results in coming days.\n\nTrump could seek a recount in Wisconsin if he loses the state by less than 1 percentage point. If his loss is between a quarter of a point and 1 point he would have to pay for the recount, which would likely cost a few million dollars.\n\nBiden campaign attorney Bob Bauer called Trump’s demands to stop counting ballots extraordinary and unacceptable. He noted Republican lawmakers in states like Wisconsin didn’t allow absentee ballots to be counted before Election Day, which contributed to delays in tabulating the ballots.\n\n“They were looking to logjam that process,” Bauer said.\n\n– Patrick Marley\n\n7:40 a.m.: Are we headed for a Wisconsin recount?\n\nThe presidential race in Wisconsin looks like it will be decided by the thinnest of margins, likely putting it in recount territory.\n\nUnofficial returns in Wisconsin showed Democrat Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by about 20,000 votes as of early Wednesday. That's a tiny share of the 3.2 million votes that were cast.\n\nIf the race stays within 1 percentage point, the losing candidate can force a recount. If the margin is larger than that, there's no chance for one.\n\nBefore any decision could be made on a recount, the official results need to be finalized over the coming weeks.\n\nA recount in 2016 resulted in few changes to the final tally in Wisconsin. That year, Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes out of about 3 million cast.\n\nRead the full story from Patrick Marley.\n\n4 a.m. Wisconsin again goes down to the wire\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden overtook Trump in early morning hours when the city of Milwaukee finally reported its roughly 170,000 absentee votes, which were overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nTrump had nurtured a lead of more than 100,000 votes before that.\n\nWith Biden up by around 8,000 votes, there were still votes to be reported from the city of Kenosha and Green Bay, Democratic-leaning communities.\n\nWhile Trump did worse in much of metropolitan Milwaukee and Madison than he did four years ago, he did a little better in much of northern and central Wisconsin. The urban-rural political divide widened.\n\nRead the full story from Craig Gilbert\n\n3:10 a.m. Milwaukee's 169,341 absentee ballots have been counted, results will be be reported\n\nMilwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg headed to Milwaukee County with a police escort and the results of the 169,341 absentee ballots that had been returned to the city.\n\nShe delivered the results, stored on electronic drives, to Milwaukee County Elections Director Julietta Henry.\n\nThe county will update its website with the results of the votes. Henry estimated they would be updated withiin 30 minutes — sometime before 4 a.m.\n\n—Alison Dirr\n\n1:13 a.m.: Ballot processing continues, counting expected to take a few more hours\n\nMilwaukee’s Central Count was pretty quiet around 1 a.m. as the processing continued after many of the election workers had left for the day. The whir of ballot machines had largely died down.\n\nIt’s still expected to take a few hours before the city’s 169,341 returned absentee ballots are fully processed and uploaded to the Milwaukee County website.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n12:15 p.m.: AWOL Waushara County DA ousted\n\nWaushara County will have a new district attorney after Republican Matthew Leusink beat Democrat Laura Waite.\n\nGov. Tony Evers appointed Waite to the position in April. However, just two months after her appointment, Waite stopped showing up for work and a judge appointed a special administrative prosecutor in her absence.\n\n— Natalie Brophy\n\n11:26 p.m.: Absentee ballot count expected to be finished by 3 a.m.\n\nMilwaukee County Clerk George Christenson just reported that counting of all the absentee ballots should be finished by 3 a.m.\n\nHe said Milwaukee Central Count has processed 140,000 absentee ballots with about 30,000 left to be counted, moving up the finish time by an hour or two.\n\nChristenson also said three of the eight municipalities counting their own absentee ballots have finished - Shorewood, Greendale and South Milwaukee. He expects West Allis to be done in one to 1 1/2 hours.\n\n— Meg Jones\n\n11:22 p.m.: Steil wins re-election in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District\n\nRepublican Congressman Bryan Steil declared victory over Democrat Roger Polack at a watch party at Route 20 bar and restaurant in Racine County.\n\n“Tonight we sent a message, loud and clear, that the violence that we saw in Kenosha must never happen again,“ Steil said. “Everyone has a right to feel safe. Everyone.”\n\nSteil said he will continue to “move our country forward.“\n\nHe also reminded the crowd that a lot of races haven’t been called yet in Wisconsin including the presidential race but he’s “feeling good” about Republicans chances.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n10:52 p.m.: Election observers from Europe surprised by young voters\n\nTwo election observers at Milwaukee’s central count Tuesday night had crossed the Atlantic Ocean to be there.\n\nFarah Karimi from The Netherlands and Gergely Arato of Hungary, both national-level elected officials in their respective countries, had come with the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, which the U.S. is also a member of.\n\n“It was very good to see how many good people are working for the success of the election,” Arato said, noting he encountered poll workers who care about the work they’re doing.\n\nHe was surprised by the number of young people who turned out to vote in every polling place they visited.\n\nIt was clear, they said, that the people they talked to wanted to be part of deciding who would lead the country.\n\nThe pair estimated they had visited 11 or 12 polling locations in Milwaukee and Washington counties on Tuesday before stopping by the city’s central count operation.\n\nIn Wisconsin, election observers do not need to be Wisconsin residents. They also don't have to be U.S. citizens or live in the U.S.\n\nKarimi and Arato were interested in Wisconsin not solely because the state allows international observers but also because of its status as a key swing state in the 2020 election.\n\nThe pair arrived in Milwaukee on Monday and will leave Wednesday, though they said they had been in Washington D.C. since Friday learning about election law, campaign finance and more.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n10:48 p.m.: Volunteers help out at polls in Port Washington\n\nPort Washington City Clerk Susan Westerbeke said a lot of volunteers stepped forward to work across the city’s three polling sites.\n\nShe said they brought on extra poll workers to train volunteers in advance of Election Day.\n\nWesterbeke said plenty of voters registered today, but the amount was similar to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWith the volume of absentee ballots received, Westerbeke said they’re hoping to have everything counted by 11 p.m. or midnight.\n\nShe said about 80% of absentee ballots have been processed by 8 p.m.\n\n“We didn’t have any issues with electioneering at all, or voter intimidation,” she said.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n10:35 p.m.: People in West Allis cast votes nearly two hours past closing time\n\nLong lines in West Allis meant some voters cast their ballots around 9:45 p.m., according to WISN-TV reporter Ben Jordan.\n\nAnd at least one woman was turned away as she tried to get into the line just after 8 p.m., according to WISN.\n\n“We are aware of long voting lines at several West Allis polling locations,” West Allis Mayor Dan Devine said in a tweet.\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\n10:11 p.m.: Some jurisdictions ran low on ballots, Elections Commission official says\n\nIn five counties in Wisconsin, local clerks had to request more ballots because they were running low, according to Tim Murtaugh, President Donald Trump’s campaign communications director.\n\nMurtaugh made the comments on PBS Tuesday evening.\n\nMeagan Wolfe at the state Elections Commission said there were some reports this evening of some small jurisdictions running low on ballots, but they contacted their counties and got more.\n\n\"The counties were able to get them the ballots they needed to get through the night,\" Wolfe said.\n\nShe did not say which jurisdictions asked for more ballots.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Patrick Marley\n\n9:41 p.m.: Milwaukee County Clerk reaffirms that complete results won’t be expected until early morning\n\nMilwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said 432 out of 478 polling places have reported which is typical for this time on election night.\n\n\"Things are progressing as we were expecting.\" That does not include absentee totals. \"They're still counting absentees,\" said Christenson.\n\nHe reiterated what Julietta Henry said an hour ago, that complete vote totals will not be done until \"well into the morning hours.\"\n\n— Meg Jones\n\n9:32 p.m.: Ballot workers advised not to discuss results\n\nJust before polls closed at 8 p.m., Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg cautioned workers processing ballots at the city’s central count location not to discuss the results of the election, audibly gasp or have other reactions as results start to come in.\n\nThe results from Milwaukee’s absentee ballots are expected around 4 a.m., officials said Tuesday evening.\n\nAround 7:30 p.m., it was announced that workers for the city had counted 102,310 absentee ballots out of an estimated 169,000 returned.\n\nStill outstanding were some absentee ballots from the city’s 15 drop boxes, but Mayor Tom Barrett said at a press conference that he did not expect a significant influx since the drop boxes had been emptied throughout the day.\n\nThe results from the city’s 173 polling places were sent via modem to Milwaukee County about 8 p.m. The first results released by the county will solely be from polling places.\n\n“I think it’s amazing how many people, during a pandemic, continue to believe in this country, believe in this community and want to be involved in our democratic process,” Barrett said, thanking voters who turned out Tuesday.\n\nThe absentee ballot figure will be released by the county once all the ballots have been counted, hopefully by 4 a.m.\n\nWoodall-Vogg said once the absentee count is finished, she will have a police escort to take encrypted flash drives to the county. The county will then manually load the results into the reporting software and report it all at once on the county website.\n\nWoodall-Vogg said about 4,000 poll workers in the field and at central count Tuesday “made a very smooth Election Day possible.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\n8:37 p.m.: Expect to wait for final results, director says\n\nJulietta Henry, Milwaukee County Board of Elections director, announced at the county courthouse that the final results from the presidential election will not be done earlier than 5 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWorkers at the so-called “central count” location in Milwaukee began counting absentee ballots at 7 a.m. Tuesday with three shifts counting until they finish. The ballots include those mailed, put in dropboxes and cast during early in-person voting.\n\nUnder state law, the totals from absentee ballots won't be released until the very last one passes through a tabulating machine. Votes from individual polling places will be released when they're sent to the county.\n\nThe mechanical tabulators can process 1,200 to 2,000 ballots per hour. Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg expects the machines to be the busiest between 10 p.m. and whenever the final ballots are counted in the wee hours of Wednesday.\n\n— Sophie Carson, Meg Jones\n\n8:17 p.m.: Polls closed in Wauwatosa\n\nWauwatosa officials came to Hart Park at 7:45 p.m. to collect the final absentee ballots that were dropped off there, as the ballots had to be at central count at city hall by 8 p.m.\n\nThere were 2 ballots inside, as the last pick-up of ballots was around 6 p.m. It’s about a 7 minute drive to city hall from the park. The city also closed the drop box it has at city hall at 7:45 p.m.\n\nThe city has counted around 20,000 of the absentee 24,000 ballots so far, per city officials. There are around 34,000 registered voters in the city.\n\nIn September, the city said they’d need around 50 more poll workers to help count absentee ballots. Twenty Wauwatosa high school students helped with the central county operation today as well.\n\nVoter turnout in the city for the 2016 election was at 89%.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n8:15 p.m.: Voters confused about polling site location\n\nDozens of people showed up at Zablocki Library on Election Day, thinking they could vote there, when their polling place was elsewhere.\n\nZablocki Library was a polling place on Election Day, but only voters living in two certain wards could vote there. Before Tuesday, the library was used as an early voting site, open to any eligible voters in the city.\n\n“I think there has been some confusion because when they had early voting, if they were in different wards, they could still come here,” said Chief Inspector Linda Leaf. “But for today, … they have to go to their regular polling site.”\n\nThe polling place had a couple of poll workers at a time stationed outside the library Tuesday, asking voters for their address and checking if they were at the right polling place.\n\nMike McBride, a poll worker at Zablocki, estimated he had to direct about 40 voters to other polling places.\n\nA total of 250 voters had cast a ballot on Election Day at Zablocki Library as of 6:15 p.m., Leaf said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n8:09 p.m.: Few late voters spotted at Sholes Campus School / Donald W. Reagan high school\n\nTwenty minutes before polls close, there are very few voters coming to Sholes Campus School / Donald W. Reagan high school.\n\nElections inspector Jack Gaboury said they had lines with about 40 people or about half an hour wait early morning but then things slowed down. Gaboury estimated that half the voters cast their ballots by mail or during early voting.\n\nThere wasn’t an after 5 p.m. voting rush. They’ve had plenty of poll workers, including two who speak Spanish and about five observers total.\n\nJesus Gonzalez, 18, voted there just a few minutes before the polls closing time. He voted for Biden. He says he wants as president someone who can take care of the epidemic and keep the country together, “not separated by racism.”\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n8:06 p.m.: Cudahy official reports high voter turnout\n\nAfter voting at South Milwaukee’s city hall at about 6:20 p.m., Brandon Kowalski said both presidential candidates said some “messed up” things but he went with the current president for a second term. “I like Trump better,” he said.\n\nKowalski also voted for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nSimilarly, South Milwaukee resident Rebecca Pappalardo said she voted for Trump because of his “achievements” and “promises kept.” She also voted for him in 2016.\n\nLeisa Jean, also from South Milwaukee, wasn’t able to vote in 2016 because she was out of the country. Jean called the 2020 presidential race “significant, dramatic and emotional.” The voting experience in South Milwaukee was overall pleasant and well coordinated, she said. However, Jean did take issue with how close people had to get at the registration table. Jean didn’t want to say outright who she voted for, but said in some countries “socialism isn’t a bad word.” However, she said that system may not work in a country like the United States.\n\nIn neighboring Cudahy, resident Ed Owczarek also stuck with his previous party vote in 2016 and voted for Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Owczarek said the biggest issues this election are the pandemic and economy.\n\nCudahy’s Director of Office Services Kelly Sobieski said turnout has been strong and while she doesn’t have the exact numbers yet, “it’s a safe bet” that Cudahy’s voter turnout is around 90%. She said the city does traditionally have a high turnout for presidential elections, however, so she doesn’t think this is a record setting year.\n\nSobieski received high praise from first-time poll worker Karen Martin. After seeing numerous ads asking for help, Martin took time off work and decided to volunteer. She said she was very impressed with Sobieski who helped her to learn the ropes.\n\n“Her planning was stellar,” Martin said.\n\nOne thing that stood out to Martin was how in-depth the process was which she said you can’t know until you’re working behind the scenes. The “terror of missing one pink slip” is real, she said while taking a quick puff of a cigarette on a break. She called the whole experience “incredible and very emotional.”\n\n“If my two hands and 10 hours of time can help get it done and get it done well, I’ll do it,” she said.\n\nDespite the stress, Martin said she would volunteer to work the polls again “without a doubt.”\n\n— Erik Hanley\n\n7:56 p.m.: A few late Madison voters make it to polls\n\nAt Steamfitters Local 601 in Madison, only a few voters made their way into the polling place in the final hour before polls closed. Chief inspector Hayden Stone said about 2,700 people voted at the location in person, and poll workers processed an additional 3,300 absentee ballots. It was a busy day, but the line was gone by 7 p.m., surprising for a polling place hosting 9 wards. Stone said the day went smoothly, no issues with electioneering or bad attitudes.\n\n“The general attitude was way more lighthearted than anticipated,” he said. “The number of excited people was higher than usual.”\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n7:55 p.m.: Roughly 300 people go through polling site’s doors\n\nCatherine McCoy, the chief election inspector at the Milwaukee Housing Authority, said they had roughly 300 people come through their doors. “Turnout has been better than expected,” she said. The location serves two wards.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n7:39 p.m.: Postal Service disregards court order to do ballot sweeps in Wisconsin, other swing states\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service disregarded a federal judge's order Tuesday to sweep mail processing facilities serving 15 states, including Wisconsin.\n\nThe agency said late Tuesday it would instead stick to its own inspection schedule.\n\n\"Defendants have been working to comply with this Court's Order, which requires a 'sweep' of postal facilities within several specified districts, while recognizing the limitations caused by time and the Postal Service's pre-existing Postal Inspection processes,\" the U.S.P.S. response read. \"As of the time of this filing, that process remains ongoing.\"\n\nThe agency has disclosed that more than 300,000 ballots nationwide could not be traced.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza, Cary Spivak\n\n7:21 p.m.: Lines fade away in Shorewood as Election Night continues\n\nLines were long to start the day at both Shorewood polling locations, but nonexistent by 6:30 p.m at the Shorewood Village Center.\n\nVillage Clerk Sara Bruckman said absentee ballots were over half processed by 2:30 p.m.\n\nA woman from the district attorney’s office was called to the voting site early afternoon to inform a man holding a Biden sign that he was too close to the building, said Beth Hengst, a greeter at the village center.\n\nHegnst said the man cooperated, and asked for a map to see the nearest distance he could hold the sign at.\n\nHengst started her shift at 2 p.m. and noted that most voters have been college students who weren’t registered to vote.\n\nMonica Glowacz, a 24-year-old nursing student, voted for the first time. She preferred not to share her vote, but said she voted for a different party than her family.\n\n“Before, I was more influenced by my family, but now I grew up so I definitely have my own opinions,” said Glowacz.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n7:14 p.m.: Kerry Washington’s tweet puts Milwaukee in spotlight\n\nActress, producer, and director Kerry Washington tweeted “All eyes are on Milwaukee right now!!!!!!! You have the power. Sooooo much power. Polls close at 8pm!!! Let's gooooooooooo!” and tagged the Wisconsin Democrats’ Twitter account shortly before 7 p.m.\n\nShe included a video with her tweet, which had been watched more than 37,000 times by 7:10 p.m.\n\nWashington has 5.4 million Twitter followers.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\n7 p.m.: Inspector praises voter turnout at North Division High School\n\nChief Election Inspector Karen Thomas at the North Division High School polling location said about 70 voters have come through and they have had seven election observers throughout the day. “I think the turnaround was good all the way around,” she said.\n\nNorth Division High School, too, saw some fresh faces at the polls this year.\n\nGabriella Ingram turned 18 in September and said she was coming out to vote because, “I want Joe Biden in office ... because I want Trump out.”\n\nJames Ingram, her older brother, is voting in his second election.In 2016, he voted for Clinton and is sticking with the Democratic candidate this time too. “I’m a schoolteacher and I’m worried about a lot of people during this election,” he said.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n6:55 p.m.: Barnes and Crowley make final push to get people to polls\n\nLt. Governor Mandela Barnes and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley made plea a little after 6 p.m. for voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots.\n\nCrowley urged voters to head to their poll stations, saying that as long as they are in line before 8 o’clock they can still cast their ballots.\n\n“Please, make sure to let your voice be heard,” he said.\n\nBarnes repeated the plea: “If you have not gone to vote yet, please do so.”\n\nBarnes said he doesn’t have any estimated ranges for the turnout in Milwaukee or Wisconsin, but that he is confident in Wisconsin voters.\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n6:32 p.m.: National Guard members deployed to help at polls\n\nAbout 220 National Guard members were deployed to Wisconsin’s polls to fill in as poll workers, and another 200 are available as backups if more are needed tonight, according to the state Elections Commission.\n\nAt a virtual news conference this evening, commission director Meagan Wolfe said no major poll worker shortages or other problems at the polls have been reported so far today.\n\nResults are expected to come in late because of the nearly 2 million absentee ballots that need to be counted. Milwaukee’s results aren’t expected until 3 a.m. at the earliest.\n\n“If unofficial results aren’t available until tomorrow morning, it doesn’t mean anything went wrong,” Wolfe said. “Our election inspectors, they’re going to continue to value accuracy over speed.”\n\nOf nearly 2 million absentee ballots submitted in Wisconsin, about 970 had some kind of deficiency that could prevent them from being counted, according to the state’s top elections official.\n\nThat’s just a small percentage of the overall absentee ballots in the state.\n\nWhen voters submit absentee ballots, they must be enclosed in an envelope that includes their signature, the signature of a witness and the address of the witness. Without all three, the ballot won’t be counted.\n\nClerks often alert voters well before Election Day if there are problems on their ballot envelopes so they can fix them.\n\nWolfe said some of the approximately 970 absentee ballots with problems may be fixed before polls close at 8 p.m.\n\n— Patrick Marley\n\n6:29 p.m.: Election inspector highlights strong voter turnout\n\nFor Chief Election Inspector Georgia Collins, November at Washington Park Library marks her 33rd year working in elections. This year, she said, turnout has been high.\n\n“The turnout is beautiful, it was better than Obama’s (election),” she said. “And they got these kids out here and that’s what I want.”\n\nShe said most of the day has gone smoothly, and she has no worries about voting, although she hopes there are no more disruptions outside the building.\n\nA speeding car, followed by several police vehicles, crashed on West Lisbon Avenue around 6 p.m. Collins said the crash drew all the attention of voters inside and outside the building.\n\n“I’m just worried about the street activities,” she said, pointing in the direction of the wrecked car. “I don’t want no fights, no fires.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n6:18 p.m.: Green Bay total approaches 2016 level\n\nVoters in the city of Green Bay had cast nearly 40,000 ballots as of 4 p.m. Tuesday, Mayor Eric Genrich said; the total of 39,298 is roughly 70% of the number of registered voters in the city.\n\nAll ballots cast, including early and Election Day voting, will be counted before poll workers end their workday, the mayor said. He expected that the count will continue at least until early Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We're making good progress,\" he said. \"But we still have a ways to go.\"\n\nThe vote total of absentee ballots and those cast Tuesday by 4 p.m. equated to about 84% of the total cast in the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton election in 2016.\n\nOne of multiple tallying machines being used to count ballots experienced a jam early in the day. Genrich said a technician from the company that manufactures the machines was able to repair the problem.\n\n— Doug Schneider\n\n6:15 p.m.: Kosciuszko Community Center sees steady stream of voters\n\nChief inspector Terry Longo said that at most they have had a line with three to four people at Kosciuszko Community Center.\n\nHe said they have been busy though, with over 300 people voting today.\n\nLongo said they have had 13 observers, and plenty of poll workers, some of whom speak Spanish.\n\nOne pers, Precious Jimenez, voted for her first time. She says it made her feel good and important.\n\n— Maria Perez\n\n6:05 p.m.: She brought her sealed ballot and dog\n\nDiana Lopez showed up at Milwaukee German Immersion School ready to drop off her ballot in a sealed envelope.\n\nShe was told by poll workers that those could only be returned in drop boxes, but if Lopez wanted she could vote in-person and they would destroy her sealed ballot.\n\nNo big deal, she just needed to go home a few blocks away to get her photo ID.\n\n“That’s why it wasn’t a problem,” Lopez said. “I’m sure if somebody else had to do that, they probably would not have.”\n\nSo Lopez left with her young daughter and tiny dog, after some petting by a poll worker, then returned five minutes later.\n\nAfter waiting in line about 20 minutes, Lopez voted in the school’s gymnasium, dog in tow.\n\n“She’s a corgipoo,” Lopez said. “She’s only seven months old.”\n\nShe came out still with her sealed ballot.\n\n“They said I could destroy it at home,” Lopez said.\n\n— Ben Steele\n\n5:49 p.m.: Lines calm down, voting goes smoothly at Kenosha Bible Church\n\nThe line at Kenosha Bible Church stretched down the block before the polls opened. But, eventually, that morning crowd calmed down, and the day went smoothly for poll workers and voters.\n\nKhris Bellaire recently moved and had to reregister.\n\n“I’ve probably been here 10, maybe 15 minutes but only because I had to register,” Bellaire said.\n\nGoing into Election Day, Bellaire said he “wasn’t really swayed on both sides,” but ended up voting for Donald Trump.\n\n“Just because of the things he’s done and the things he said he was going to do versus Biden who hasn’t really done anything in the whole 47 years he’s been in office,” Bellaire said adding his vote was both for Trump and against Biden. “I was giving both the benefit of the doubt… I just can’t wait for it to be over now.“\n\nStacy Delaney said the voting process was easy but this election has been emotional for her.\n\n“I supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries, I was a little disappointed with Joe Biden,“ Delaney said. “but not disappointed enough to not vote for him. I don’t think I can take four more years of Donald Trump.“\n\nDavid Mendlik said the voting was “smooth and painless.”\n\n“You got to go through all the weeds, find what you think is true and what you think is right and vote with your gut,” Mendlik said on how he viewed this election.\n\nMendlik didn’t want to say who he supported in the presidential election “because of all the fallout that’s predicted by the Democrats.“\n\n“Every time they’ve talked they said if Trump wins there’s going to be chaos and protests and riots,“ Mendlik said. ”In this day and age we have to take that kind of stuff serious.“\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n5:49 p.m.: Souls to the Polls finds success in other states\n\nThe Souls to the Polls operation offering free rides to Milwaukee voters has gone national.\n\nCoordinator Norma Balentine said her volunteers have booked Uber and Lyft rides for voters in New Haven, Connecticut, and St. Louis – in addition to the dozens booked in Milwaukee – after callers in other states found their number online.\n\nSouls volunteers fielded several calls for rides, in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Minnesota and elsewhere. They initially turned callers away, but then decided, “why not?” said Balentine.\n\nThe volunteers staffing the Souls to the Polls’ Zoom-based call center also come from all over – places like Illinois, California and even Alaska.\n\nJeff Powers was taking calls at his home in Palmer, Alaska, a solidly Republican area about 40 miles outside of Anchorage. A geologist and environmental consultant, Powers had planned to travel to Milwaukee and offer free rides to voters. But he was persuaded to help online instead because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Voters in Wisconsin have more power,” he said. “I wanted to apply my resources in an area where I could make a difference.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n5:20 p.m.: Voters want their ballots to count\n\nThere’s a new image emerging in this year’s election: the persistent voter.\n\nOrganizers and volunteers with the faith-based coalition Common Ground said they worked with several voters Tuesday who were determined to cast their ballots, despite barriers that in the past might have caused them to give up.\n\n“The overall trend I’ve seen today is people just being so persistent in voting,” said Jennifer O’Hear, executive director of Common Ground, which has more than 150 volunteers working to get out the vote on Tuesday, including poll protection teams at several sites aimed at ensuring everyone who turned out to vote got to do so.\n\n“I can’t believe how many people who got sent home to get more information and they came back,” she said. “Or people who were sent to two and three different polling sites.”\n\n“We were busy all day with people who needed help,” she said.\n\nIn one case, an attorney had to intervene after a poll worker at Hillside Family Resource Center told a voter she’d have to go home and find her absentee ballot, O’Hear said. In another, at Starms Discovery Learning Center, volunteers worked with the Department of Motor Vehicles to get an emailed copy of a voter’s ID, which had been lost with his wallet.\n\nZipporah Turnbull, who worked to troubleshoot problems for several voters at Starms, said one man was turned away because he’d moved and didn’t have proof of his new address. She urged him to go home and scour his house for paperwork. “He was really down when he left. But he came back,” she said. “I told him, ‘we’re going to do this together,’” she said. “He made my day.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n4:53 p.m.: Voces de la Frontera sends in translators\n\nWhen a church voting site in a Latino neighborhood in Waukesha opened without Spanish speaking poll workers, Voces de la Frontera sent two election observers in to help with translating, said Voces spokeswoman Jacquelyn Kovarik. The observers remained at the Evangelical & Reformed United Church of Christ throughout the day.\n\n— John Fauber\n\n4:47 p.m.: 'I just want to see change come about'\n\nEbony Shelton voted in 2016 for Clinton and said that she felt the precautions were safe enough that she could vote in person this during this presidential election.\n\n“I just felt that it was very important and there’s a lot at stake,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she believes that Biden “has our best interest at heart” and also said, “I hope he can continue with some of the things that Obama had going.”\n\nTrump, she said, 'didn't align with my personal values.'\n\n“Anytime you take a stab at someone for what they believe, that does it for me.\"\n\nMarie Hyde said voting on Election Day was a tradition for her.\n\n“I (voted) to make a difference. If one vote would do it, I want it to be mine,” she said.\n\nShe voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and said she was voting for Biden because she likes what he says. She also described his choice of Kamala Harris, the first woman of Black and Indian ancestry to run on a major ticket, was “beautiful.”\n\nOn Trump, she said, “He ain't s***,” later adding, “I just want to see a change come about.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n4:44 p.m.: Oconomowoc negotiates unusual election\n\nIn the city of Oconomowoc, Clerk Diane Coenen said this election is the first time she has had observers at all four of her polling locations who spent the entire day there.\n\n“Typically if I get one observer, they don’t necessarily stay the entire day,” Coenen said. “Right now, they’re there for the entire day.”\n\nCoenen also said the city had some voters with COVID-19 who voted curbside. While poll workers have PPE available, one told Coenen they were uncomfortable with it.\n\n“Even though they have garb and face masks on, now they’ve touched the ballot, you put the ballot in the machine and now that ballot with potential germs is in with other ballots. At the end of the night you’re handling those ballots. It’s a little concerning for them. They feel that is not something they should have to do, especially when the voter in their vehicle is not wearing a mask.”\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n4:41 p.m.: City official: 'What's really important to me is that America stop being so angrily divided'\n\nLafayette Crump, Milwaukee’s Commissioner of City Development, was at the South Division High School poll site this afternoon.\n\n“What’s really important to me is that America stop being so angrily divided” he said. “I am also worried about some of the language that’s stoked the idea that patiently counting votes means something nefarious is going on.\"\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\n4:41 p.m.: Community confusion around Mitchell Street Library location\n\nMore than 50 people showed up at the Mitchell Street Library on election day thinking they could vote there, apparently not knowing that it was only an early voting site that had stopped accepting votes on Saturday, according to Jacquelyn Kovarik, a spokeswoman for Voces de la Frontera.\n\nVoces stationed couple of its workers at the library who helped voters find the correct place to vote.\n\n\"There clearly was confusion in the community,\" she said.\n\n— John Fauber\n\n4:39 p.m.: Trump yard signs doused with gasoline in Racine, homeowner says\n\nAccording to the Racine Journal Times, a Racine resident's yard signs supporting President Donald Trump were doused in gasoline early Tuesday morning.\n\nFootage of the incident, captured on a doorbell camera, shows a man pouring what the Journal Times reported was gasoline on several Trump signs staked into the home’s front yard on Ohio Street.\n\nThe man also poured gasoline down the side of the house, knocked over a flag pole and broke a light in the yard, according to the Journal Times.\n\nThe man did not set the signs or house on fire, running away instead, homeowner Tom Marquis told the newspaper.\n\nMarquis’s friend and neighbor, Marco Diaz, noticed the damage Tuesday morning and alerted Marquis. Diaz’s yard is full of signs supporting Joe Biden for president, and on Halloween, the two dressed up as their presidential picks to hand out candy to trick-or-treaters.\n\n—Sophie Carson\n\n4:33 p.m.: Milwaukee musical duo Sista Strings brings joy to the polls in Bay View, part of national venture\n\nJoy to the Polls, a group of non-partisan election observers, have positioned music groups across the nation near polling places to make voting more joyful.\n\nIn Milwaukee, the organization used local band Sista Strings to bring joy to voters at Fernwood Montessori School in Bay View.\n\nThe Joy to the Polls has deployed various nationally recognizable musicians, including rapper Busta Rhymes and singer Patti Smith, to polling locations in New York, Florida and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nJoy to the Polls was also playing music for early voting, which spurred a viral dance party at a polling place in Philadelphia.\n\n— Jordyn Noennig\n\n4:30 p.m.: Adult site offers free memberships to Wisconsin voters\n\nGiving new meaning to the term “swing state,” a national adult hook-up site is offering free Gold memberships to new subscribers who vote Tuesday in 13 key states, including Wisconsin.\n\nAdultFriendFinder is offering its “Swinging in the Swing States” promotion to voters in hotly contested states. To redeem their free memberships, voters can submit photos of themselves with their “I Voted” sticker or a photo of themselves waiting in line at a polling location to swingvotes@ffn.com.\n\nThe company says it already has more than 1 million Wisconsin subscribers.\n\n“Swinging has always been a team activity,” FriendFinder Networks spokesman Gunner Taylor said in a news release. “And we’re hoping to inspire our community to tap into that team mentality to encourage high voter turnout for this year’s election, particularly in the crucial swing states.”\n\nWisconsin law prohibits giving people anything of value in exchange for them voting or not voting.\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n4:24 p.m.: Confusion at museum polling places in Kenosha\n\nThe Kenosha Public Museum and Civil War Museum are less than 50 yards apart but they are also polling places, which has caused some confusion with voters in the city.\n\n“It was the worst voting experience I ever had,” Bryant Banks said. Banks added he checked online to make sure he was registered to vote before going to the polls on Tuesday but when he arrived at the Civil War Museum he was told he wasn’t registered. He had to go to the public museum to register.\n\nHe registered and went back to the Civil War Museum to vote. There was some confusion as to which museum he was supposed to cast his vote but eventually it was settled.\n\n“What’s the point of having people check online if they’re registered to vote if when they got here they can’t vote and have to re-register,” Banks said.\n\n“It seems like it’s set up to have people not vote.” Banks said he saw multiple people walk back and forth between the two buildings. “It’s just chaotic,” Banks said. “It just seems not well put together. And I don’t know if that’s on purpose or not on purpose. It just needs to be done better. “\n\nJocelyn Aguirre’s normal polling place was moved to the Civil War Museum but she went into the public museum by mistake.\n\n“It was a different location than what I’m used to which was a little confusing at first,“ Aguirre said. “I didn’t realize there are two separate museums. I just saw the word ‘museum’ and figured ‘OK this must be it.’”\n\nHowever, some people were able to vote at one of the museums without a problem.\n\n“It’s the first time I’ve been in the museum it looks great,” said John Pellamolla who voted at the Civil War Museum.\n\nEarlier in the day many people were arriving at the Kenosha Municipal Building thinking it was a polling place.\n\n“We do our best to redirect them to where they need to go,” said City Clerk Matt Kauter. The municipal building is being used to count absentee ballots.\n\nKrauter said the city received nearly 30,000 early and absentee ballots before Election Day and anticipated the workers will count about 47,000 ballots in a city with roughly 53,000 registered voters.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\n4:18 p.m.: Two cast first votes for Trump\n\nBoth Elizabeth Rosado, 34, and Par Cung, 42, voted in their first presidential election Tuesday at the Lyons Park polling site.\n\nThey both cast their vote for Donald Trump.\n\nRosado said in Spanish she voted for Trump for religious reasons and because she is against abortion. Cung pointed to high taxes and said she trusted Trump to keep the country great.\n\n“I like to work. I’m very hardworking,” said Cung, who is originally from Burma. “I work so much but I pay too much in taxes.”\n\nSara Flores, 30, voted for Joe Biden, who she hopes will unify the country and better address the pandemic.\n\n“For me the biggest thing is the school system,” she said, adding it isn’t working for some students and parents during the pandemic.\n\nA mother of four, Flores said she feels torn between her roles as a mom, a wife and a school employee.\n\nHer kids are struggling, she said, especially her 6-year-old who has special needs. She worries that if he doesn’t get the supports he needs now, at a young age, he will suffer more down the line.\n\n“They’re not getting what they need,” she said.\n\nShe’s stuck asking herself should she stay at her job or quit.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n4:15 p.m.: People vote early at Rufus King High School\n\nAt the Rufus King High School polling site, Chief Elections Inspector Vicki Robinson, said people showed up as early as 6:30 a.m.\n\n\"It was social-distanced, no one was complaining, everyone was mellow,\" she said.\n\nThe site had seen 334 voters so far and six election observers. She said a lot of people have come with mail to show their address and they've also signed up a lot of new voters.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n4:11 p.m.: Hoan Bridge light show will match election results\n\nOn Election Night, let there be light.\n\nWhether its blue or red will depend on the results.\n\nLight the Hoan, a community-driven effort that resulted in LED light displays unveiled on the Hoan Bridge in Milwaukee last month, is coordinating a light show to match the election results as they're called Tuesday night: blue for states that go Democrat, red for Republican — and some red, white and blue to represent the good ole' USA.\n\nThe lights will be going from dusk until 2 a.m., but folks who can't get out to the bridge tonight can watch a 15-minute light show live on the Light the Hoan Facebook page at 9 p.m.\n\n— Piet Levy\n\n4:06 p.m.: Delafield running smoothly\n\nCity of Delafield Clerk Steve Braatz said the day has been “oddly quiet.”\n\n“We haven’t had major issues, complaints and things that usually arise with a presidential election,” Braatz said.\n\nThough right when the polls opened this morning, Braatz said there were 200 people in line.\n\n“They got them through in about 45 minutes.”\n\nBraatz expected all ballots to be counted shortly after polls close.\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n4:06 p.m.: Waukesha keeps collecting ballots\n\nAs of 4 p.m., the Schuetze Center in Waukesha had collected close to 1,850 ballots, including absentees, or 87 percent of previously registered voters.\n\nThough hardly what anyone would call a crowd, by 4:30 p.m. the Schuetze Center in Waukesha began seeing lines, at least for the city’s traditionally busy 5th ward. The lines still only stretched a half-dozen deep, moving people through the voting process in about five minutes.\n\nAt 5 p.m., Waukesha’s Schuetze Center began forming longer lines, resulting in 15-minute waits for some voters. The line outside the activity room door was partly the result of new voter registrants. Chief inspector John Kelling said the polling place topped the 90 percent mark of ballots cast among existing registered voters, with three hours left.\n\n6:05 p.m: Why they're voting in person\n\nFor voters at the Schuetze Recreation Center in Waukesha, the decision to trek to the polls instead of voting absentee was a combination of doing what they’re familiar with or not trusting the advanced voting options.\n\nLinda Schroeder felt more comfortable voting Tuesday “because I’m old and I don’t understand the absentee ballots,” she said, laughing. She declined to say who she ultimately voted for, adding only “the person I wanted.”\n\nMarcia Arzamendi had too little confidence in the absentee option.\n\n“I just want to make sure my vote is counted,” Arzamendi said, openly questioning the legitimacy of the push for absentee voting this year.\n\nShe voted Republican, including Donald Trump, who she said needs more time in office.\n\n“I still think he has a lot of ideas that he hasn’t had time to finish,” she said. “So another four years will be good for him. That’s what I think.”\n\nJavin Bradley also was unsure about the reliability of absentee votes and preferred to physically insert his ballot into the counting machine.\n\n“I felt it was important to come out in person, just to do my duty,” Bradley said. “I was unsure if I did it the absentee way if it would get lost in the mail. I did it in person. I saw it go into the machine.”\n\n— James Riccioli\n\n4:01 p.m.: Greendale voters go, go, go\n\nVoters may be waiting in long lines in neighboring West Allis and Greenfield, but that's not the case in Greendale.\n\nAs of mid-afternoon, there've been no lines to speak of, said Greendale Village Clerk Melanie Pietruszka, other than the lines forming before the polls opened.\n\n\"We are not seeing too many lines at all,\" she said. \"I would say at the most it's been like five people in line.\"\n\nAbout 64% of Greendale voters cast their ballots either via absentee or early voting, Pietruszka said.\n\nShe said she did receive one complaint from a voter about campaign signs being too close to the polling location at the Greendale Safety Center, but it was checked out and deemed legal.\n\n\"They're actually outside of that 100 feet from the entrance, so they are good,\" she said. \"It's just that a voter wasn't comfortable with how close they were.\"\\\n\n— Bob Dohr\n\n3:59 p.m.: Nuns visit poll sites in Milwaukee\n\nWearing bright yellow “Election Defender” sweaters and traveling in cars painted with the slogan, “Every Vote is Sacred,” more than 30 Catholic nuns are touring poll sites in Milwaukee and Detroit.\n\nTheir efforts are a part of a nonpartisan campaign to ensure that every polling location is safe and accessible for everyone.\n\n“I think that because this year our country is more divided than ever, there is potential for anger, violence and intimidation,” said Sister Janet Weyker with Racine Dominican Sisters, in Racine.\n\nAs of mid-afternoon, however, it’s been peaceful in Milwaukee. The sisters met briefly with voters at Humboldt Park where they were welcomed by other Election Defender volunteers.\n\nMany of the sisters are elderly, and coming from communities that have been following strict COVID-19 measures, they’ve been cut off from their social justice work.\n\n“It’s been a challenging time for us,” said Mary Kay Dobrovolny, a Sister of Mercy from Detroit. “Sisters can’t show up in the world the way that we’re used to. This caravan has given us a way to tell voters we’re here for them.”\n\nThe organization Nuns & Nones organized the partnership between Election Defenders and the sisters and has accompanied them on the caravans.\n\n“Sisters continue to teach me what it means to take action from a place of deep love,” says Nuns & Nones Co-director Brittany Koteles, who joined the caravan in Wisconsin. “I hope we can continue to inspire one another into more creative, courageous action.”\n\nOn Monday, Nuns & Nones and NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice organized more than 500 sisters and allies to sign letters to Secretaries of States in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, stressing the importance of counting all votes and urging their efforts to create a fair election.\n\n“Every single vote is sacred and must be cast and counted in this election,” said Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice. “The Nuns on the Bus spoke with hundreds of people across this country who have felt unheard for too long. The votes of the unemployed, those worried about losing their healthcare, or people grieving the loss of a loved one from COVID19 must be counted.”\n\nThe sisters say they’re worried about the potential for post-election civil unrest.\n\n“Obviously, half the population is going to be upset. There are going to be a lot of people who are hurting, I think, on both sides,” Weyker said.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\n3:53 p.m.: People gather on Locust Street holding signs supporting Black Lives Matter\n\nAbout 15 Cambridge Woods neighbors who live near Riverside High School, a polling site, gathered along Locust Street this afternoon as they have every weekday since early June.\n\nThey waved signs supporting Black Lives Matter, ending racism and “voting 4 equality,” as cars honked in support.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\n3:46 p.m.: Smooth sailing in Elm Grove\n\nThe clerk for the Village of Elm Grove said poll workers will likely finish counting their absentee ballots at around 7 p.m. Tuesday night. “We’ll be done on time,\" village clerk Michelle Luedtke said. \"I'll be pleased to get those results transferred to the county, hopefully right at 8:00.”\n\nLuedtke said they'd received around 3,600 absentee ballots before Election Day, or %72 of the 5,029 registered voters in the village. Around 32 poll workers were working the polls on Tuesday. Five Wisconsin National Guard members were also working the polls, many counting absentee ballots.\n\nLuedtke said the United States Postal Service was also dropping off absentee ballots one by one at village hall when they received them in the mail Tuesday, and would be doing so throughout the day. \"We already had our major mail run, so everything else is just going to be a slow trickle,\" she said.\n\nThere were longer lines in the morning when polls opened up at 7 a.m., but no lines were seen at village hall at 1 p.m. Tuesday. All voters in Elm Grove vote at Village Hall. Half of the wards vote upstairs, while the other half votes downstairs. Luedtke says a poll worker is cleaning every voting machine after it's used. She's also been helping out with the cleaning. \"I've cleaned so much my hands are starting to crack,\" she said.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n3:43 p.m.: Testing and voting lines in Madison\n\nIn Madison, the line for the COVID-19 testing site at Alliant Energy Center was about 2.5 hours long at 3 pm, according to a sign near the entrance. By comparison, voters at the Steamfitters Local 601 on the far east side were waiting around 5 to 10 minutes in line to cast their votes at 3:30 pm. The Steamfitters location is serving the most wards in the city at 9.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\n3:28p.m.: Spotting misprints in Appleton\n\nAt a table inside St. Matthew Lutheran Church in Appleton, two poll workers went through stacks of absentee ballots early Tuesday afternoon, recreating any affected by a misprint so they could be counted.\n\n“Our job is to make sure every one of these is correct and to make sure that we get them all in the computer before the night is over,” said Louise Miller, a poll worker at the church.\n\nThe misprint on as many as 13,000 Outagamie County ballots is visible in a black square — known as a timing mark — near the edge of the form. The misprint is small, but still large enough that machines used to scan ballots can't accurately read them.\n\nTo make sure those votes are still counted, poll workers have to duplicate unreadable ballots by transferring votes to a new ballot that can be read by the machine. The process requires two workers and typically takes about four minutes per ballot, according to Outagamie County Clerk Lori O'Bright, who first announced the misprint in mid-October.\n\nOutagamie County had hoped the Wisconsin Supreme Court would allow poll workers to simply fill in the imperfection, a quicker solution to the problem, but the court refused to take the case.\n\n\"Our message to the voting public is this: Your vote will be counted,\" O'Bright said in mid-October after the issue with the ballots was discovered.\n\nAt St. Matthew, Miller was confident the added task wouldn't be a problem for poll workers, including a National Guard member at the site helping process the ballots.\n\n\"If we stay calm, stay focused, we're going to get it done,\" she said.\n\n— Mark Treinen\n\n3:15 p.m.: A busy morning in Pewaukee\n\nBarb Consigny, an election inspector for the city of Pewaukee, said they were “extremely busy this morning.” As of 3 p.m., 612 people voted today at city hall.\n\n“I think (that number) is down quite a bit because in the past we didn’t have that many people encouraged to vote early,” Consigny said.\n\nConsigny said the only issue they had was people who were sent absentee ballots in the mail and didn’t fill them out.\n\n“I had to verify with the city clerk that they haven’t sent (the ballots) in,” Consigny said. “Then they gave me permission to allow them to vote here.”\n\n— Evan Frank\n\n3:15 p.m.: Mother of twins: This election 'means everything'\n\nZamaris Rodriguez brought her father, Pedro Rodriguez, to vote to Longfellow School after she herself voted at another location. She says this election “means everything.”\n\nShe thinks Trump hasn’t done enough to control the epidemic. Kids aren’t in school and people aren’t working, she said. She is a single mom and works 11 p.m. until 7 a.m. as a front desk clerk at a motel so that she can help her twins, 11, with remote learning.\n\n“I want them to be somebody,\" she said.\n\nShe voted for Biden. She thinks that Trump should have done more. When he got sick, she said, a helicopter took him to the hospital.\n\n“We don’t have any of those privileges,” she said. “We don’t have any of those resources.”\n\nRodriguez expects the president who gets elected to treat low-income residents the same way that the wealthy. She thinks Trump has been picking on Hispanics and doesn’t like how he refers to the coronavirus as the China virus. She thinks he is now also picking on Chinese people.\"\n\n— Maria Jesus Perez Sanchez\n\n3:10 p.m.: DJs from 'Amp the Vote' add to atmosphere at Milwaukee polls\n\nThe voting line at Marshall High School in mid-afternoon was sparse, but that didn’t stop the party vibe.\n\nIn the parking lot, DJ Andre Wallace was setting up his turntables.\n\nWallace was there as part of “Amp The Vote,” an initiative spearheaded by Milwaukee Action Intersection.\n\nThe MIA is a support group borne out of the social-justice protests over the summer.\n\n“Many of us were like ‘We need to take care of each other,’“ said Vanessa Parker, a 35-year-old member of MIA. “We started out having meals together and out of that came ‘We can’t march every day.’ That’s not sustainable. Some of had jobs.”\n\nSo they kicked around ideas for events and decided on “Amp The Vote” after seeing how music helped voters in long lines during last April’s election.\n\n“We wanted to make voting fun,” Parker said.\n\nDJs were found using social media. Wallace stumbled on the gig on a DJ Facebook group.\n\n“Amp The Vote” was also at the Center Street Library, Riverside High School and South Division High School polling locations.\n\n“No matter what you’re walking to the poll with or any thoughts you have,” said Kelsey Boyle, a 28-year-old member of MIA. “As you walk by and hear just the party music and good tunes, those negative thoughts don’t stick around and you leave feeling a little lighter.”\n\nWallace was playing at Marshall from 2 to 5 p.m. He just wanted to keep the positive vibes going.\n\n“Got some funk, R&B,” he said. “Like kick-back hip-hop.”\n\nWallace was plugged in and ready to go. He kicked things off with some Busta Rhymes, then Mary J. Blige and Mark Morrison’s eternal people-pleaser “Return of the Mack.”\n\n— Ben Steele\n\n2:50 p.m.: Watch 3 p.m. press conference from Central Count in Milwaukee\n\nAs the ballot counting continues, Milwaukee officials will host a 3 p.m. press conference from Central Count in Milwaukee. Watch the stream below.\n\nSpeaking of Central Count, want to know what it looks like inside the 70,000-square foot space, formerly insurance offices?\n\n2:45 p.m.: Poll worker said her worries of voter intimidation proved unfounded\n\nCarol Jones, the chief election inspector at the New Beginnings Are Possible site, said, “It has been really busy. So far, so good.”\n\nShe said that about 302 voters have come and gone and she has more than enough poll workers and six election observers for both parties.\n\nAbbie Childs, a 22-year-old poll worker said she was initially concerned about voter intimidation, but has not had to report any incidents so far. “I was worried, especially with this being a Democratic stronghold and an urban environment, I thought we might run into some voter intimidation, but fortunately, that's not the case.”\n\nChilds said the most common questions come with address verification documents, but other than that, things have been smooth, and at times, triumphant.\n\n“I thought it was my civic duty, not only to vote but help others vote as well. And that came true today when I was able to help this elderly lady across the gym to vote. She was so determined because she had lost her absentee ballot and she really wanted to vote. (That was) definitely the highlight of my day,” she said, smiling.\n\nVanessa Carney, who voted at the New Beginnings Are Possible site, said she came out on Election Day because, “I wanted to make sure my ballot actually got in.”\n\nGregory Julien, 52, said he came out to vote because he doesn’t trust the mail in ballots, but he does trust the machines.\n\nHe said he voted for Biden because Biden was Obama’s vice President and, “If Obama trusts him, I’ll trust him.\"\n\nHe also said that he doesn’t like how Trump handled coronavirus. “With the pandemic, he didn’t warn the United States and because of that, it took a lot of people’s lives.”\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n2:40 p.m.: Souls to the Polls caravans through Milwaukee, urging residents to vote\n\nVolunteers with the get-out-the-vote initiative Souls to the Polls caravanned through Milwaukee’s north-side neighborhoods Tuesday urging residents to cast their ballots for president.\n\nAbout two dozen people began assembling at Midtown Shopping Center this afternoon before heading west on West Capitol Drive toward the Westlawn and Northlawn housing projects. Though Souls to the Polls bills itself as nonpartisan, the turnout appeared to be largely, if not entirely, Biden supporters.\n\n\"People need to know that they need to vote. This is a critical, critical, critical election,” said Rev. Mose Fuller of St. Timothy Community Baptist Church in Milwaukee and first vice president of Souls to the Polls.\n\n“A lot of people, including myself, we don’t like the way our country has been moving in the last four years. … The very future of our country is at stake.\"\n\nTim Cordon, a social justice coordinator with the First Unitarian Society of Madison, stood outside the lead bus, waving a rainbow flag in one hand and a large inflated balloon of the Earth in the other.\n\n“The people are rising,” Cordon said. “They’re voting in record numbers to make sure we build a world that’s more just, more peaceful, more sustainable and run democratically, not by the rich, power-mongering, greedy corporate elite. …. It’s so exciting to be a part of this moment in history.”\n\n— Annysa Johnson\n\n2:20 p.m.: These communities already topped 2016 votes with absentee ballots, but polls were still packed Tuesday\n\nVoters in the town of Hull and the Village Plover packed into their respective municipal halls even as both locales saw record-breaking absentee ballots cast.\n\nThe socially-distant voting line at the town of Hull, for instance, stretched out of the township’s municipal hall and well on to Wojcik Memorial Drive for the first two and a half hours, Hull Chief Inspector Heidi O’Brien said.\n\nO’Brien called the volume of absentee ballots and the number of in-person voters stunning, saying she hasn’t seen anything like it in her 12 years working election day. She estimates voter turnout could hit 70% in the town. More than 2,000 people cast ballots absentee this year, far outpacing past presidential years that were about half that number, O’Brien said. Some 5,400 people live in Hull, according to the U.S. Census 2018 estimates.\n\nIn Plover, more than 6,500 people cast votes before Nov. 3, surpassing the 2016 vote total in a village of about 13,000, according to U.S. Census 2018 estimates. At noon, Village Clerk Karen Swanson said the village was processing about 135 voters an hour.\n\nIn Stevens Point, the nearly 8,000 people who voted early meant the city started Election Day with 33% voter turnout. Officials at many of the city’s 11 voting districts said about half of their registered voters cast ballots early.\n\n— Alan Hovorka\n\n2:15 p.m.: 'Hamilton' inspired one first-time voter to cast a ballot\n\nAt about 2 p.m., there were no lines at Longfellow School in Milwaukee, where chief inspector Paul Grippe said that 118 people had voted. Grippe said that he has seen about a dozen observers coming in and out, many more that at any other election. There’s been no scarcity of poll workers. They have seen a lot of new faces applying to be a poll worker.\n\nCarlos Ginard, part of the group Election Protection on behalf of Workers United, was sitting outside with two other members. He said he has been to three poll locations today and hasn’t seen lines or major issues at any of them. Two representatives from Voces de la Frontera were also outside and reported no issues.\n\nFirst-time voter Nicole Lopez, 19, said she watched Hamilton and ever since she has wanted to vote. She says that because of COVID-19, she requested an absentee ballot two to three weeks ago, but never received it, so she came in person today. Lopez says she voted for Biden and doesn’t like Trump: “It’s just a lot of hate that I don’t think should be spread”. She expects the new U.S. president will help immigrants.\n\n— Maria Jesus Perez Sanchez\n\n2:09 p.m.: One voter outlines reasons he's voting for Jo Jorgensen\n\nEddie Lemke, 33, was disappointed by President Donald Trump’s record on gun rights and the war in Iraq.\n\nHe voted Tuesday afternoon for Jo Jorgensen, the Libertarian candidate for president, at Doerfler Elementary School in Milwaukee, where the line was short.\n\nThe major issues driving him to vote this election were gun rights, anti-authoritarianism and taxes, he said.\n\nIn 2016, he also voted for third-party candidate Gary Johnson, a Libertarian. He doesn’t trust either major party candidate to address the issues he cares about.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a lot of the same stuff either way,” he said of the major parties.\n\nLemke disapproved of Trump’s calling for red flag laws, in the aftermath of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio last year. He said there has been more war under Trump and disliked that he hadn’t withdrawn more troops from Iraq.\n\nLemke said most people want the election to be over with and said the animosity during the campaign has been unhealthy.\n\n“You’re not voting for something, you’re voting against something,” he said of the candidates’ messages.\n\nAdalberto Cruz, 53, left the polling place at Doerfler shortly after Lemke.\n\nCruz voted for Democrat Joe Biden and wanted Trump out of office.\n\n“The president’s a clown,” he said. “He doesn’t respect people.”\n\nOriginally from Puerto Rico, Cruz criticized Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the U.S. territory in 2017.\n\nHe also said the island is taking the coronavirus much more seriously than the mainland.\n\nHe disagreed with Trump’s handling of the virus.\n\n“People are dying and he wants to open a lot of things,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\n2:00 p.m.: Updates from Waukesha County\n\nMark Fish said he voted for Donald Trump because of Trump’s support of law enforcement and the Veterans Administration (VA). Fish said his wife works for the VA and said he didn’t believe in defunding the police.\n\n\n\nThis year is the second election that Fish has voted Republican. He had voted for Democratic Party candidates in previous elections before 2016, which is when he first voted for Trump.\n\n\n\n“I felt that the Democratic Party ran a dirty campaign, a very dirty campaign,” Fish said about his decision in 2016 to vote Republican.\n\n\n\nFish said the one thing he wishes Trump would do differently is stay off social media and “quit poking the bear.”\n\n\n\n“All he’s doing is poking the media and making you guys think he’s doing something that he’s truly not,” Fish said.\n\n\n\nKelsey Kottwitz said she voted for Joe Biden because she doesn’t care for Trump as a person.\n\n\n\n“I can’t really support him because of my morals and what I believe in. I’m a teacher as well, so that also affects who I vote for,” Kottwitz said.\n\n\n\nAs a teacher, Kottwitz said that she thought Biden is supportive of teachers and wants to protect them. She said it’s scary for many teachers like her during the COVID-19 pandemic and said she’s lucky to work at a school that’s small enough where social distancing can take place. Kottwitz’ school operates in a hybrid model of learning.\n\n\n\n“That’s why I feel comfortable going in and working on the days that I have to, but many teachers don’t feel that way because their classes are much bigger. I think their feelings are warranted,” Kottwitz said.\n\n\n\nThis year is the second election that Fish has voted Republican.

Inside Schuetze Recreation Center in the city of Waukesha, more than 1,700 voters among the polling site’s 2,100 registered voters had already cast ballots as of 2 p.m., according to poll inspector John Kelling. That, of course, included the roughly 1,000 that voted absentee before Election Day began. “It’s been great,” Kelling said, noting it was busy in the early morning, with brief lines and no problems. “Not as busy as we would have expected, but that was because of all of the absentees.”\n\nIn New Berlin between 10:30 a.m. and 12:10 p.m, the lines at the New Berlin Public Library were short, with voters reporting waits of less than five minutes. Lisa Abbott and her daughter Kaitlyn went together to vote. This year was Kaitlyn’s first time voting, according to Lisa. Lisa said she voted in-person because she never received her absentee ballot in the mail when she tried to vote absentee in the spring. Both Lisa and Kaitlyn said they voted for Donald Trump, and Lisa said she thought Trump would help rebuild the economy. “I don’t trust (Joe) Biden. I think he’s a puppet. I think he’s going to be out in a few months and Kamala’s (Kamala Harris) is going to be president if that’s the way it goes,” Lisa Abbott said.\n\n— Jim Riccioli and Alec Johnson\n\n1:53 p.m.: Germantown officials remind voters to 'keep one cow apart' in line\n\nThe Village of Germantown officials made multiple signs with the words, \"Maintain Social Distancing\" and, in a move that is wholly Wisconsin, \"Keep One Cow Apart\" as a reminder to voters while they waited to cast their ballots.\n\n— Cathy Kozlowicz\n\n1:34 p.m.: First-time voters aplenty\n\nAt the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. School in the Harambee neighborhood, the highlight of the morning for chief inspector Bela Roongta was the surprising number of people registering to vote for the first time.\n\nRoongta couldn’t say exactly how many new registrants the polling site hosted after six and a half hours on Tuesday. But she said she was considering adding another table at the site to help speed the process along.\n\n“That’s been really gratifying,” she said. \"That’s been the longest line. It’s fun to see people register.”\n\nShe echoed what officials at other sites had reported early Tuesday: They had a decently busy morning when the polls opened and have enjoyed a quiet, steady stream of voters since then. Staffing has been “great” and there hadn’t been any delays.\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m., about 170 people voted at the school, officials said.\n\n“It was a great experience seeing everyone work together and voting,” said Marquis Shipp, 28, after casting his ballot.\n\nOver at Marshall High School, John and Alexis Cash were first-time voters and the process couldn’t have gone smoother for the couple.\n\nThere were no lines in the early afternoon, and the registration and voting process took just over 30 minutes for the two 23-year-olds\n\n“It went good,” John said. “We had to type in our new address and stuff. People were very welcoming and helped you out.”\n\nThey had not planned on voting, but were swayed after talking with friends. John had the day off from work, making it easier to get to the polls as a family.\n\n“I feel like every vote matters,” Alexis said. “And it’s important to come out and vote.”\n\nThere was also an immediate benefit. While John and Alexis answered questions, the couple’s young son giggled incessantly and played with John’s “I Voted” sticker.\n\n— Elliot Hughes and Ben Steele\n\n1:27 p.m.: Few reports of problems at the polls in Wisconsin\n\nElection Day is proceeding smoothly with few reports of excessive lines or voter intimidation, Wisconsin’s chief election official Meagan Wolfe said at a midday press briefing Tuesday.\n\nWolfe said lines appear to be shorter overall than in past elections, likely due to the large number of people who already voted via absentee ballots. Nor have any polling sites reported a shortage of poll workers, she said.\n\nElections officials have not heard any specific threats against polling sites or large-scale disinformation campaigns, the Wisconsin Elections Commission said. The Milwaukee Police Department, Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Department and the Wisconsin Attorney General’s office all reported no issues.\n\nAbout 200 National Guard service members have been deployed as poll workers and are wearing civilian clothes, Wolfe said.\n\n“None of them are in uniform and none are serving in any law enforcement or crowd control capacity,” she said.\n\nThe ACLU of Wisconsin and other nonprofits watching for voter issues also reported few hiccups.\n\nCommon Ground executive director Jennifer O’Hear said the nonprofit talked to one voter who lost her absentee ballot but was told she could not vote in-person unless she produced the ballot. O’Hear said the group managed to get a lawyer on the phone with the poll worker to allow the woman to vote.\n\n“Fortunately we caught that early this morning, because it could have happened to a number of people,” O’Hear said.\n\nOverall, O’Hear said she was impressed by the persistence of voters this year.\n\n“We’ve seen a number of voters who’ve come and had to go back home and get documentation and they’ve done it,” O’Hear said. “I’m really impressed with people’s persistence.”\n\n— Daphne Chen, Cary Spivak\n\n1:20 p.m.: These statues in Greenfield are dressed for the occasion\n\nThe two lion statues outside of The Starr Group in Greenfield are dressed up in donkey and elephant costumes for Election Day.\n\n\"Any event that we feel is important, we try to dress them up,\" said Mary Starr, who co-owns the insurance agency at 5005 W. Loomis Road with her husband, Tim Starr.\n\nThe lions have been decorated for just about any and every occasion since the early ‘80s. The agency’s longtime client, Darlene Mattmiller, has made all of the lions' costumes and dressed them up, with help from her son, Dave Mattmiller.\n\nRead the full story from Hannah Kirby.\n\n1:15 p.m.: One voter said early-morning long lines in South Milwaukee not too much hassle\n\nSouth Milwaukee resident Robyn Polak found herself in a long line a little before 8 a.m. at Divine Mercy Parish, 800 Marquette Ave., Nov. 3. She was voter 121 on election day.\n\n“The lines actually moved fast, only three main votes on the ballot, others were for local positions,” Polak said. “I was in and out within 25 minutes. I think the wait was worth it, met some great people, too.”\n\n— Erik Hanley\n\n1:10 p.m.: One inspector relieved to see 'nightmares' of Election Day unfounded\n\nAt the Green Tree Preparatory School poll, chief inspector Terre Welbes, 72, didn’t know what to expect on Election Day.\n\n“I was dreaming it. I had nightmares,” she said.\n\nBut when the day came, Welbes had no conflicts or instances of voter intimidation. She was glad to see the election coming to an end.\n\n“I’ll sleep really well tonight,” said the retired teacher.\n\n— Mark Johnson\n\n1:08 p.m.: Voter said she wanted to make sure her vote 'wasn't lost'\n\nRuthie Sparks, a 57-year-old Milwaukee resident, said she chose to come to the polls on Election Day because she wanted to make sure her “vote wasn’t lost.”\n\n“I wanted to see how many people would come,” she said, adding that most were still at work. When asked who she voted for, she said, “It wasn’t Trump. I don’t like Trump; he ain’t right. He’s the reason all this mess is going on.”\n\nIf Trump wins, Sparks said she thinks things will “be even worse than (they are) now.” More people, she said, need to come out here and vote.\n\nJoy Hudson, the chief elections Inspector for the Thurston Woods Elementary School voting location says that everything has gone well so far.\n\n\"Nobody has wanted us to answer any questions,\" she said. \"They just went to get in and vote.\"\n\nRoughly 190 people have come through the doors and Hudson said even though there has been a morning rush and a steady trickle of voters since then, she thinks a lot of people voted early.\n\nBrandi Byas, a 25-year-old voter at the Thurston Woods location, said she voted in 2016 for Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe said she was a little bit worried about mail-in voting, which is why she came in person for this election.\n\n\"I don't know about that mail; I had a package addressed to me that got delivered to the wrong house, I don't trust them,\" she said laughing.\n\nShe also said that she voted for Biden, adding that it would take a paragraph to explain why she's not voting for Trump. \"I don't believe in his views,\" she said. \"Let's leave it at that.\"\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n1:04 p.m.: ACLU doesn't believe long lines are indication of polling-place problems\n\nWhen longer lines have been seen at Wisconsin polling places Tuesday, it's been the result of significant voter turnout and social distancing measures — not because there are problems with election administration, said Molly Collins, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin.\n\n\"Things seem to be running pretty smoothly,\" Collins said mid-day Tuesday.\n\nThe ACLU of Wisconsin has election observers throughout the state and is responding to Wisconsin calls made to the national nonpartisan Election Protection hotline 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683).\n\nACLU election observers also have noted an increased police presence at polling locations in some cities around the state, but not in Milwaukee.\n\n\"I'm concerned about police presence in polling places and potentially disenfranchising folks who may be uncomfortable around police,\" Collins said.\n\n— Ashley Luthern\n\n12:56 p.m.: Craig Gilbert breaks down the Wisconsin race\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel Craig Gilbert, the Washington bureau chief, breaks down what he's looking for as results begin to pour in from Wisconsin's election.\n\n12:41 p.m.: Green Bay police chief allays concerns over online ballot-counting rumor\n\nIn Green Bay, city officials reported a minor delay in voting at one site because a ballot machine was slow to start, one incident of someone illegally electioneering and concerns about an online rumor related to the city’s ballot counting.\n\nOne machine at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay poll location was not ready on time at 7 a.m., Mayor Eric Genrich said during a midday press conference.\n\n“But there was no malfunctioning or any problems with the equipment. It was just kind of a matter of the machine being a little slow to wake up,” Genrich said.\n\nGreen Bay Chief of Police Andrew Smith warned against misinformation circulating online that ballot counting was suddenly and mysteriously moved from City Hall to the KI Convention Center. Smith clarified that it was planned several weeks ago. The “Central Count” location in Green Bay is among 39 set up statewide.\n\nSmith noted election observers from both parties are at Green Bay’s Central Count site, and he said there was a minor incident of someone campaigning too close to a polling site in the city.\n\n“One of our officers went by there, asked them to move 100 feet away and they cooperated and that was the end of that,” he said.\n\nThe chief said there were some pre-scheduled rallies and some people are going around the city in caravans trying to get out the vote.\n\n“I don’t consider any of that protests; I consider them rallies and that’s fine,” Smith said. “We welcome people to do things of that nature of course.”\n\nSmith said the police are monitoring what’s going on across the country, social media, and in Green Bay in regard to protests Tuesday night. Police usually find out protests in advance and help coordinate and facilitate those events, he said.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\n12:35 p.m.: Roughly 200 voters at Milwaukee Safety Academy before noon\n\nBelinda Bradley, chief elections inspector for the Milwaukee Safety Academy, said the location was crowded when doors first opened. “The lines were long, they were outside the door and into the parking lot.”\n\nThings eased up at 10, she said, and gave a rough estimate of about 200 voters that had come through.\n\nShe said there were quite a few new voters and voter registrations and most people were asking if they were in the right ward. The location serves as the polling place for both wards 18 and 19.\n\nThere weren’t enough poll workers in the beginning, Bradley said, but the commission quickly sent more. Observers, on the other hand, have dwindled from five in the beginning down to two.\n\nBradley said even though she knows things are slow right now, she’s expecting an after-work surge.\n\n“I know we’re going to get that rush at around 1, 3 and 5 (o’clock), because that’s when people start getting off work,” she said.\n\n— Talis Shelbourne\n\n12:00 p.m.: Yes, Wisconsin does in fact have same-day registration\n\nA tweet this morning from the ACLU that's been retweeted more than 30,000 times lists the states in which voters can register at the polls on Election Day.\n\nBut they left off Wisconsin, among a litany of other errors.\n\nTo be clear: Voters who aren’t registered can do that at the polls today and vote immediately in Wisconsin. Just don’t forget your photo ID and proof of residence.\n\nOther states left off the ACLU list that do allow same-day registration are Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Rhode Island and Utah, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and Ballotpedia. Rhode Island voters registering on Election Day can only vote in the presidential race.\n\nUpdate: The ACLU corrected the error and acknowledged earlier omissions, though the initial tweet had been re-tweeted 30,000 times by then.\n\n— Eric Litke\n\n11:53 p.m.: No lines at all in Brookfield\n\nNo lines, inside or outside, were seen at Brookfield East or Brookfield Central High Schools at 11 a.m. Tuesday morning.\n\nMany voters at both locations said it took them less than five minutes to vote.\n\nEmily, a 37-year-old Brookfield resident, said she voted for President Donald Trump Tuesday. She said she voted in-person because “this is the day we vote.”\n\nShe said she’s voting “to support freedom.”\n\n“I believe Trump wants to keep our country free, and Biden wants to shut our country down,” she said.\n\n“It has less to do with the person and more to do with the policies. I wouldn’t say he’s my favorite person in the world,” she added.\n\nJacob Rosenthal also said he also voted for Trump in 2016. He did the same this year.\n\n“I had a really big problem with Biden’s pro-choice issue,” he said.\n\nHe didn’t vote before election day because he’s worried about possible fraud.\n\n“I just had a really big problem with the whole mail-in ballot thing,” he said.\n\nAlexia Miles, a poll worker at Brookfield East High School said the “vast majority” of voters were wearing masks.\n\nThis is her first time working the polls.\n\n“One thing with the coronavirus, a lot of poll workers are elderly, and there might be a shortage, so I wanted to do what I could to help,” she said.\n\n— Evan Casey\n\n11:30 a.m.: Glendale swiftly recovers after election official contracts COVID\n\nGlendale’s city clerk was diagnosed with the coronavirus last week, said Mayor Bryan Kennedy in an email, but the deputy clerk and other workers are still handling the election.\n\n“We had two workers that worked closely with her stay home in quarantine,” Kennedy said in an email. “They wore a mask any time they were out of their offices in city hall. Those two tested negative two times over the course of five days. They are back at work and assisting with the election from their offices at city hall.”\n\nKennedy said the deputy clerk is handling the election with help from the city administrator. The deputy clerk has called the city clerk for advice throughout the day, he said.\n\n“We have chief election inspectors at our three locations and poll workers dealing directly with the public,” said Kennedy.\n\nHe said just over 75% of registered voters have voted early.\n\n— Eddie Morales\n\n11:21 a,m,: Turnout slower than usual at Gordon Park, but plenty of food\n\nTurnout has been slower than usual today for a presidential election at the Gordon Park polling site, potentially due to early voting, said election official Yves Lapierre, who has been working elections for 16 years.\n\nBut there has been more free food than other years, he said.\n\nJames Sauer of Company Brewing had a table stacked high with ham and turkey sandwiches to give away as part of World Central Kitchen’s #chefstothepolls initiative.\n\nThere were also plenty of poll workers on hand, with 35 people signed up to help throughout the day, Lapierre said.\n\nAdditionally, a Republican from Wisconsin and two Democrats from Wisconsin and Illinois were signed in as observers. Lapierre said he has had out-of-state observers before and the number wasn’t unusual.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\n11:16 a.m.: West Allis has some of the area's longest lines\n\nIn West Allis, lines snaked around the outside of City Hall; at Central High School, they stretched far down the street. In both places, the wait times at mid-morning were averaging around an hour, according to voters and election officials.\n\nBoth polling places were serving voters from six wards, the most of the city's five locations.\n\n\"So far, so good. It's been pretty smooth,\" said West Allis Election Services Specialist Gina Gresch.\n\nGresch said the early part of her day was spent fielding questions about hospitalized voters.\n\n\"COVID voters, because they're quarantined, we have to treat them as hospitalized voters, and there's an extra process to that,\" she said.\n\nOther questions have dealt with where people can go to vote and what they need to vote, she said.\n\nIn terms of turnout, Gresch said absentee ballots alone accounted for nearly 54% of registered voters.\n\n— Bob Dohr\n\n11:00 a.m.: World Central Kitchen handing out food in Riverwest\n\nNobody was stuck in line to vote at the Fratney School in Riverwest late Tuesday morning, but volunteers with World Central Kitchen were there to hand out food anyway.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen is an organization created in 2010 primarily to distribute food to those impacted by natural disasters all over the globe.\n\nThe food stand was manned by Liz Hagedorn, the general manager for Club Charlie’s, which provided the parfaits and chicken salad sandwiches.\n\nShe said she and her crew were bouncing from polling site to polling site Tuesday “just to feed people while waiting to vote, do something good. It’s nonpartisan.”\n\nWater and transportation were provided by J.L. Bloom’s Landscapes.\n\n— Elliot Hughes\n\n10:57 a.m.: First-time voter cites pandemic as driving factor in her choice\n\nAt 10:30 a.m., 18-year-old Adriana Merkel cast her very first vote at the Milwaukee Sign Language School. The pandemic was a major factor.\n\n“Biden is more concerned. He’s wearing the mask. Trump thinks it’s a joke. Biden takes it seriously. I feel like everybody should vote, especially this election with Trump in office. We’ve got to get him out.”\n\nShe walked out of the poll with Jason Swiderski, a 40-year-old electrical worker.\n\n“I voted for Biden because he doesn’t lie and I think he’ll have a better control of the virus,\" Swiderski said.\n\n— Mark Johnson\n\n10:50 a.m.: Musicians bringing their craft to polling places\n\nCarrie and Brian Kulas stood outside of the polling place at Lincoln Park for District 8 in Manitowoc, playing the violin and the string bass, respectively, for two hours Tuesday morning. The pair usually plays for the Manitowoc Symphony Orchestra, but today they were playing for Play for the Vote, a national, nonpartisan organization that arranged for musical performances at polling places throughout the country.\n\n“It’s a pretty anxious time and you get tired of sitting around on your hands waiting for someone else to make something happen,” Brian Kulas said. “Music is all about togetherness. It’s really a universal language. It doesn’t matter what side you’re on, everybody loves music.”\n\n— Alisa Schafer\n\n10:48 a.m.: Disappointment with both candidates not deterring voters\n\nP", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/13/monster-catfish-mountain-lion-cub-sturgeon-warning-news-around-states/50068179/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The National Rifle Association has endorsed Gov. Kay Ivey in her bid to win a second full term in office. Ivey in March signed legislation abolishing the state requirement to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public. The new law takes effect Jan. 1. In a brief campaign event announcing the endorsement, Ivey said people in Alabama will stand up for their constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A group organizing all-star games for Alaska high school basketball players has apologized for asking players and their families to sign a liability waiver form that included their rights and claims in potential cases of sexual abuse or misconduct. The Alaska Association of Basketball Coaches updated its form after growing complaints were posted on social media. The group held all-star games for more than a decade, and association president David Porter said they never had any incidents. Games have not been played the last two years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm plans to visit Northeastern Arizona this week as part of the Biden administration’s push to shore up the president’s standing in rural America. Granholm plans to highlight the benefits of the infrastructure bill that Biden signed last year during a two-day visit that includes stops on the Hopi and Navajo reservations. She plans to hold roundtable discussions Wednesday and Thursday on energy opportunities in rural areas and the clean energy transition. U.S. Rep. Tom O’Halleran also will be there. O’Halleran is one of the most endangered Democrats in Congress after the boundaries of his rural district were redrawn to make it significantly more conservative.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The Fort Smith Board of Directors will discuss Next Step Homeless Services’ relocation out of downtown at a special study session at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Blue Lion. For more than two decades, the nonprofit’s storefront on the corner of North 6th and B streets has been a refuge for people experiencing homelessness. Next Step now rents from St. John’s Episcopal Church, which started its mission before becoming an incorporated nonprofit in 2002. Since then, growing pains and the need for additional client services have led the nonprofit to look for a new location.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: An orphaned and emaciated mountain lion cub spotted by hikers in the San Francisco area was brought to the Oakland Zoo, where veterinarians have named her “Rose” and are trying to nurse her back to health. An initial exam indicated Rose had not eaten in weeks, Dr. Alex Herman, the zoo’s vice president of Veterinary Services, said in a statement. The cub, estimated to be about 5 months old, weighed just 8.8 pounds. The average female cub her age should weigh about 30 pounds. After a day of treatment, veterinarians are guardedly optimistic about Rose’s recovery. She is receiving fluids and hydration intravenously and being bottle-fed small amounts of formula several times a day. Rose is the 18th orphaned mountain lion cub the Oakland Zoo has received and rehabilitated from the state since 2017, zoo officials said. Three of the 18, Coloma, Toro, and Silverado, still reside at the zoo.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: A wildfire that began Sunday burned about 20 acres of vegetation north of the Arkansas River and east of Pueblo Boulevard near 11th Street.

Up to 230 remain in the wild.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: University System of Georgia regents, meeting Tuesday at Albany State University, approved tuition and fee rates for the system’s 26 schools that will result in overall costs going down by 7.6% at the typical school. Students will save anywhere from $226 for a full two-semester load at Georgia Southern University’s Armstrong campus in Savannah to $1,088 at Georgia Tech. The only exception is Macon-based Middle Georgia State University, where total costs for in-state undergraduates will rise $20 next year to $4,762 as part of a three-year plan to increase tuition to line up with similar universities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A Hawaii couple have dropped their petition for a temporary restraining order against actor Ezra Miller, who is known for playing “The Flash” in “Justice League” films and allegedly harassed patrons of a karaoke bar in a Big Island town last month. According to court documents, a judge dismissed the restraining order case Monday after the couple requested it. William Dean, an attorney who represents the couple, declined comment Tuesday on why his clients no longer want to pursue the petition that accused Miller of bursting into their bedroom and threatening them in Hilo, the same town where Miller was arrested. A judge had granted the restraining order petition, saying it was needed to prevent future harassment and had set a hearing for Wednesday. It’s unknown if the hearing will be held now that the case is dismissed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise, which covers all of Idaho, filed a request with the State Supreme Court to intervene in support of a state abortion ban as a “friend of the court.” Idaho last month became the first state to enact legislation modeled after the Texas statute banning abortions after about six weeks. Planned Parenthood of Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky sued over the law, calling it unconstitutional, and last week the Idaho Supreme Court blocked the abortion ban from taking effect while the lawsuit is underway.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Melodie Gliniewicz, the widow of a northern Illinois police officer who killed himself amid an investigation of his alleged theft of thousands of dollars from a youth program was sentenced Tuesday to two years probation for her role in the scheme. Gliniewicz, who pleaded guilty in February to one felony count of deceptive practices in exchange for prosecutors’ agreement to drop several other charges, faced a maximum sentence of three years in prison. But Lake County Judge James Booras’ sentence was not surprising given that prosecutors did not ask that Gliniewicz be sent to prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A white Purdue University police officer seen on a cellphone video using his elbow to pin a Black student’s neck to the ground won’t face charges because he used reasonable force when the student resisted arrest during a domestic call, a special prosecutor found. The student, 24-year-old Adonis Tuggle, also will not be charged in the Feb. 4 incident, even though “probable cause exists for multiple criminal charges,” Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings said in a report released Monday. Tuggle’s arrest stoked anger among Black students and others on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus. Cummings said he was honoring requests by Officer Jon Selke, Purdue representatives and “the victim” in the domestic incident that Tuggle face no criminal charges. Separately, Purdue said in a statement Tuesday that Selke apologized to Tuggle and that school officials have agreed on steps to prevent a repeat of the incident.\n\nIowa\n\nGilmore City: A tornado hit near Gilmore City in rural north-central Iowa as a strong line of storms moved across the state overnight, the National Weather Service said Wednesday. The tornado was confirmed by a trained spotter southwest of Gilmore City and tracked several miles to the northeast, weather service meteorologist Rod Donavon in Des Moines said. Up to 10 tornadoes were reported across mostly the northern half of the state as the storms moved through, Donavon said, but only ones near Logan in western Iowa and near Stacyville and St. Ansgar in northeastern Iowa have been confirmed. Survey teams were headed to those areas Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes had touched down and to verify the intensity of those storms.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed a bill that would prevent cities and counties from banning, limiting or even taxing plastic bags, straws and food containers. Kelly rejected the measure Monday after previously telling reporters she was a “major local-control advocate.” The Senate approved the measure in February, but its initial version did not explicitly cover plastic straws. The House made sure it did before passing the measure.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is holding a remembrance event Thursday that commemorates the death of the 16th president. The event will begin with a speech from Layton Carr, a guest park ranger from Ford’s Theatre who will recall Lincoln’s assassination and its impact on the nation, park spokeswoman Stacy Humphreys told The News-Enterprise. Lincoln was shot April 14, 1865, while watching a production of “Our American Cousin” and died the next morning. The commemoration also will include music from the Kentucky Home Guard Band, a period Civil War-era brass band that will perform mournful music, and there will be a reading of Walt Whitman’s elegy, “O Captain! My Captain!”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s public colleges and universities are revamping classes for students who aren’t prepared for college English or math. Instead of taking noncredit courses with short class sessions, those students will attend longer sessions that move through the semester from makeup material to college-level work. They’ll also get additional academic support, and if they pass will get college credit. This approach, called co-requisite, helps more students remain in college and graduate, removing barriers to higher education, the Board of Regents said in a news release. The new model will be statewide for math in fall 2023 and for English the following fall.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state Senate unanimously voted Tuesday to confirm Rick Lawrence as the first Black justice to the state’s highest court. A legislative panel voted last week to confirm Lawrence to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. The Senate then issued its confirmation Tuesday. Lawrence, 66, became Maine’s first Black judge when he became a district judge in 2000, the Portland Press Herald reported. He currently serves as the deputy chief judge of the District Court. Lawrence is on tap to replace Justice Ellen Gorman, who has announced her intent to retire. Gorman has served on the court since 2007.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced plans Tuesday to seek reelection as she awaits trial on federal criminal charges stemming from her purchase of two Florida vacation homes. Mosby, a Democrat, released a campaign video that combines aerial views of the city with her interacting with residents and a number of local and national leaders, interspersed with newspaper headlines and video excerpts. Mosby was scheduled to go to trial May 2 on charges of making false statements on financial documents to withdraw money from her retirement savings and purchase the vacation homes. A federal judge last week granted a request by Mosby to postpone the trial, now set for Sept. 19.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is again trying to avoid execution, asking the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to consider four constitutional claims not taken up when his death sentence appeal went to the Supreme Court last month. Tsarnaev’s attorneys in a filing April 7, said the trial court “improperly forced” their client to stand trial in Boston; violated his constitutional rights by denying his challenges to two jurors accused of lying during questioning; dismissed a potential juror because of that person’s opposition to the death penalty; and allowed the admission as evidence of what they called Tsarnaev’s “coerced confession.” The filing was in response to an April 6 filing by the appeals court to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision last month to reinstate Tsarnaev’s death penalty.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Brian Sullivan has ordered the demolition of the deteriorating Packard auto plant in Detroit, finding that it had become a public nuisance. Sullivan wrote in an order that the plant’s Peruvian owner, Fernando Palazuelo, and his company, Arte Express Detroit, must remove all rubbish and debris from the sprawling site and demolish all buildings and structures on the property, which covers several blocks on Detroit’s east side. The March 31 order declared that the more than 30 parcels owned by Palazuelo “are a public nuisance which interfere with common rights enjoyed by the general public by significantly threatening the public’s health, safety and welfare.” Demolition and abatement work has to start within 42 days of Sullivan’s order, with clean up completed within 90 days. If the work is not completed, the city is authorized to have it done, with Palazuelo possibly being responsible for the costs, which are expected to be in the millions of dollars. The order came after Palazuelo failed to appear at a March 24 trial.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Two Illinois men who helped bomb a Minnesota mosque in 2017 on Tuesday received prison sentences far below the 35-year mandatory minimum that they faced after victims and prosecutors asked for leniency because the men cooperated and testified against the mastermind of the attack. Michael McWhorter, 33, was sentenced to just under 16 years in prison and Joe Morris, 26, was sentenced to about 14 years. Both testified in the 2020 trial against Emily Claire Hari, the leader of a small Illinois militia group called the “White Rabbits.” Hari was convicted in late 2020 and sentenced last year to 53 years in prison for the attack on Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center, a mosque in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Eugene Cronley of Brandon, Mississippi, caught a 131-pound blue catfish on April 7 that not only set a state record, but possibly a world line class record. Cronley was fishing in a 90-foot hole when his rod bowed over. Cronley said he knew the fish was big, but had no idea how big. “We catch a lot of 50-pounders down there and I knew he was bigger than that,” Cronley said. “We didn’t know until we pulled him up. We knew then we had a monster.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A St. Louis man with a long history of stealing and fraud convictions was sentenced Tuesday to federal prison for fraudulently receiving $2.7 million in federal coronavirus aid. Robert Williams, 58, was sentenced to 10 years and 5 months in prison after he filed about 30 fraudulent applications for aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help small businesses affected by the pandemic. He also was paid a fee for helping other people file 23 fraudulent loan applications for the aid money. Williams received the loans despite having a history of crimes dating to the 1990s including passing bad checks and identity theft, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Williams pleaded guilty in December to seven counts of bank fraud.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The State Land Board took action March 21 to support efforts to restore Stonewall Hall in Virginia City, a crumbling structure that advocates of the plan said is the most important building in Montana’s history. The board voted 5-0 to accept the donation of the building at 300 Wallace St. that served as the territorial Capitol building from 1865-1875, the Independent Record reported. The backyard of the building is believed to be an area where lawmakers might have settled disputes with their fists. Justin Gatewood, Virginia City’s mayor, told the land board members their approval would make it a monumental day for the history books. Elijah Allen, executive director of the Montana Heritage Commission, said the building was being donated to the state by the Neal C. LaFever Trust and contingent upon the heritage commission having full ownership.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: A Madison County man who was burning trash on his rural property died when the flames caught his clothing on fire, authorities said. The incident happened Monday morning on property northwest of Norfolk, the Norfolk Daily News reported. Firefighters and Madison County Sheriff’s deputies called to the scene for a report of a fire found Stanley Acklie, 72, dead on his property from burn injuries. His body was found near a fire that was burning several outbuildings on the property, officials said. Sheriff Todd Volk said in a statement that Acklie had been burning trash when the fire apparently went out of control and ignited his clothing. Officials said it appeared Acklie had tried to remove his burning clothing before succumbing to the flames. The area has been under an elevated fire risk because of high winds and dry conditions.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge in Carson City has dealt a setback to a group trying to get a school vouchers question before voters in Nevada, ruling that signatures can’t be collected for a proposed constitutional amendment to let parents use state money to pay for private school tuition. Senior Judge Charles McGee compared petition wording by the Education Freedom PAC to a shell game that hides “the enormous fiscal impact of this initiative on the budget of most, if not all” schools in Nevada. Education Freedom PAC leader Erin Phillips, head of the advocacy organization Power2Parent, didn’t immediately promise an appeal to the state Supreme Court. But she derided McGee’s ruling as “a bizarre, rambling decision” that she said should have come quickly but languished for weeks and ended well beyond what initiative opponents sought by blocking her group from collecting signatures.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers working to shut down New Hampshire’s troubled youth detention center heard competing opinions Tuesday on whether to construct a new facility or contract with a private company. The state spends $13 million a year to operate the 144-bed Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester, although the typical population is about a dozen teens. Debate over its future began years ago, but has come to a boil amid horrific sexual abuse allegations. Last June’s state budget has mandated closing the center by March 2023. The Senate passed a bill last month, however, that would extend the deadline, giving the state until June 30, 2024, to build a new facility. Now debate has moved to the state House.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Atlantic City casino workers believe they are closer than ever to getting a law passed that would ban smoking in the gambling halls. Tuesday was the 16th anniversary of a New Jersey law that banned smoking almost everywhere indoors, except in casinos. About 250 casino workers held a rally in a waterfront park to call on the state Legislature to pass a bill that already has many co-sponsors in both parties. The casino industry and the main casino workers labor union oppose the bill, saying it will lead to job losses and revenue declines. No vote has yet been scheduled.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRuidoso: A wind-driven wildfire swept through neighborhoods in a mountain community in drought-stricken south-central New Mexico, burning at least 150 structures and forcing the evacuations of schools with 1,700 students, officials said Wednesday. Homes were among the structures that burned Tuesday but officials did not have a count of how many were destroyed in the blaze that torched at least 6.4 square miles of forest, brush and grass on the east side of the community of Ruidoso, said Laura Rabon, spokesperson for the Lincoln National Forest. No deaths or injuries were reported from the fire fanned by winds gusting between 50 mph and 90 mph, Rabon said. The cause of the fire was under investigation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany:The state Department of Transportation is expected to begin an environmental impact review this year as the first step toward a long-awaited expansion of Route 17 in Orange and Sullivan counties becoming a reality. Marc Baez, president and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership for Economic Development, said he expects the review to stretch into next year. The expansion was included as part of a five-year Department of Transportation capital plan established with the adoption of the 2022-23 state budget last week. The environmental review, as well as some initial construction expected to follow, will be funded by up to $1 billion earmarked in the budget.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: An elections board in Macon County has removed Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, from its list of registered voters after documents showed he lived in Virginia and voted in the 2021 election in that state. Questions arose about Meadows last month, when North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein’s office asked the State Bureau of Investigation to look into Meadows’ voter registration in Macon County. In announcing his removal, the Macon County Board of Elections said it has received no formal challenge. A representative for Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Capitol and other state facilities, along with scores of schools, government offices and interstates, remained closed Wednesday as a blizzard continued to bear down on the state. A blizzard warning issued by he National Weather Service remained in effect through Thursday for most of western and central North Dakota, where up to 2 feet of snow was expected. Interstate 94 from the Montana border to Jamestown, a distance of about 260 miles, and Interstate 29 from Fargo to the Canadian border, remain closed because of treacherous travel conditions. Gov. Doug Burgum directed the state closures, noting that the Emergency Operations Center has been activated and is coordinating with partners and local emergency managers statewide to ensure that resources, including search and rescue, are available.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Former President Donald Trump is returning to Ohio on April 23 to try to boost Republican candidates and turnout ahead of the May 3 primary. Trump will headline an evening rally at the Delaware County Fairgrounds in Delaware, north of Columbus. News of the rally came as early voting figures suggested turnout in the populous Midwest battleground, which Trump won twice by more than 8 percentage points, might be severely depressed this year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Political hopefuls from across Oklahoma descended on the state Capitol on Wednesday for the start of the state’s three-day candidate filing period. Candidates for state, federal and some local offices began lining up early to submit their paperwork. State election officials said the expect between 500 and 600 candidates to file for office during the next three days. In addition to this year’s governor’s race, Oklahoma has two U.S. Senate seats up for grabs. Races for U.S. Senate are typically staggered, but both will be on the ballot this year because U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe announced plans to resign in January, just two years into his six-year term. Candidate filing will continue until 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Multnomah County, in partnership with the city, opened three shelters Tuesday night because of wintry weather. Portland officials said the shelters will be open from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 8 a.m. Wednesday. The shelters are at the Salvation Army located at 5325 N. Williams Ave., the Sunrise Center located at 18901 E. Burnside St. and Imago Dei at 1302 SE Ankeny St. Adults, children, couples and pets are all welcome. People can call 211 to find shelter or transportation in the area. Portland received the first measurable snowfall in April in recorded history on Monday, which caused school closures, downed trees and power outages. The National Weather Service said 1 inch of snow fell at Portland International Airport. Portland received three-tenths of an inch of snow Tuesday, which set a record for latest measurable snowfall in the season, the weather agency said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state House voted Tuesday after a tense debate to approve a bill that would prohibit transgender girls from competing in girls’ school sports. All but one Republican and four Democrats voted for the proposal to restrict players on K-12 school teams, college sports, intramurals and club teams sponsored by school entities to male or female teams based on their reproductive organs, biology or genetics at birth. The bill, which went to the state Senate for its consideration on a 115-84 vote, would prevent “students of the male sex” from playing on athletic teams designated for women or girls. It would provide a way for students and schools to sue, including against athletic organizations. A spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said Tuesday if the bill makes it to him he will veto it.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: School-zone speed cameras have been activated at six more locations in Providence, according to the Police Department. Initially, speeding drivers will receive warnings. Starting June 6, speeders will receive a summons, according to police. The six cameras, which were activated Wednesday, are in addition to 14 other camera locations, according to police. The new locations are Plainfield Street (Laurel Hill Annex School); 773 Chalkstone Avenue (Nathaniel Greene Middle School); Hope Street (Hope High School); Mount Pleasant Avenue (Mount Pleasant High School); Bridgham Street (Providence Career and Technical Academy); and Branch Avenue (E-Cubed Academy). The cameras operate on all school days from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. Vehicles operating 11 mph or more over the 20 mph speed limit will automatically be issued a violation, according to the police. Fines are $50.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Police have arrested a man who allegedly sent dozens of threats to Black civil rights attorney and former state lawmaker Bakari Sellers. Grant Edward Olson Jr., of Asheville is also accused of intimidating Sellers for exercising his civil rights as an attorney, television commentator and lobbyist, authorities said. Olson, 48, was arrested Friday and booked into the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center in Richland County. Arrest warrants from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division showed Olson sent dozens of messages to Sellers on Instagram that included racial slurs, indications that Olson was armed and mentioned the killings of African-Americans. Police said Olson admitted to sending the messages earlier this year. Sellers, a son of civil rights activist Cleveland Sellers, was first elected to the state House as a Democrat in 2006 at the age of 22 and has also worked as an attorney and as a political analyst on CNN.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican Paul TenHaken will remain the mayor of Sioux Falls for another four years. The incumbent took 73.06% of the vote in the three-way race, defeating challengers Taneeza Islam and David Zokaites and securing a second term without the need for a runoff election. It’s the second time TenHaken has won by the largest margin of victory since the city moved to a strong-mayor form of government in 1995, breaking the record he set in 2018 when he got 62.7% of the vote over Jolene Loetscher in a runoff election. Islam’s campaign garnered 24.57% of the vote, with Zokaites at 1.9%.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Mayor John Cooper said he plans on signing an executive order to make Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in the U.S., an official paid holiday for city employees. According to a news release, Cooper will sign the directive Thursday. Juneteenth, also known as Emancipation Day and Freedom Day, commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers told enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, that they were free. It was two months after the Confederacy surrendered and more than two years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. The federal government made it an official holiday last year.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A South Texas judge set an execution date of Oct. 5 for John Henry Ramirez, a death row inmate who won a reprieve when his request for his pastor to pray out loud and touch him as he received his lethal injection sparked legal debate. Ramirez, 37, had been set for execution on Sept. 8, 2021, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked his execution and agreed to take up his case to address the role of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. Last month, the court said states must accommodate the wishes of death row inmates who want to have their faith leaders pray and touch them during their executions. Seth Kretzer, Ramirez’s attorney, said Wednesday a Houston federal court is still considering a civil rights petition he filed on behalf of Ramirez and that he doesn’t believe an execution can proceed until it’s resolved.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:New coronavirus cases increased in Utah in the week ending Sunday, rising 11.7% as 699 cases were reported. The previous week had 626 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Utah ranked 40th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. In the latest week, coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 20.8% from the week before, with 238,885 cases reported. With 0.96% of the country's population, Utah had 0.29% of the country's cases in the last week. Across the country, 34 states had more cases in the latest week than they did in the week before.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:A luxury home on Shelburne Point has sold for $10.25million, the \"priciest\" to ever sell on the open market in Vermont, according to the Wall Street Journal. A bidding war broke out over the six-bedroom home listed in December for $9.8 million, co-listing agent Wade Weathers of LandVest told the Journal. The sellers were Florida-based developer Jeffrey Halvorsen and his wife, Elizabeth, who bought the land in 2012 for $2.48 million and built an 8,400-square-foot vacation home. \"It's bittersweet,\" Elizabeth Halvorsen told the Journal of the decision to sell. \"We put our heart and soul in it.\" The property has about 1,300 feet of frontage on the lake. The house includes an elevator, a gym and an office, according to the Journal. The record-breaking sale reflects much different market conditions than four years ago, in 2018, when the Burlington Free Press reported there were more than 100 high-end homes on the local market, defined as homes costing $850,000 and above.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed 26 bills – including some that passed with broad bipartisan support – as he took action on more than 800 bills the divided legislature sent him during its regular session. None of the vetoed bills was sponsored by a Republican, a point Democrats quickly seized on, criticizing the first-term governor as excessively partisan. Youngkin’s veto total was higher than any other governor in his first year in office since Republican Jim Gilmore, who had 37 in 1998, according to an accounting by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who preceded Youngkin, was close with 20.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State health officials in Washington and Oregon are recommending the public limit their consumption of sturgeon caught from the lower Columbia River. A health advisory came from the Washington Department of Health as fish tissue data showed contaminant levels of polychlorinated biphenyls – or PCBs – at levels above Washington state’s screening values, The Seattle Times reported. In Washington, the advisory applies to any fish caught in the Columbia River between the Bonneville Dam and the mouth of the Columbia. Officials recommend that most adults should not eat more than eight meals of sturgeon a month, and no more than seven for pregnant women, nursing mothers and children. The Oregon Health Authority also issued an advisory for the lower Columbia River and the lower Willamette River.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The influx of prescription opioids into West Virginia communities was the main driver of the state’s drug crisis, an epidemiologist testified Tuesday at the ongoing trial against three major pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Katherine Keyes, director of Columbia University’s Psychiatric Epidemiology Training Program, described West Virginia, one of the poorest U.S. states, as the “epicenter of the opioid crisis in the U.S.” More people have died of overdoses in the state per capita than any other, all while the state has been grappling with a loss of jobs from the declining coal industry. West Virginia was one of the only U.S. states to lose population during the 2020 U.S. census.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic state Rep. Gary Hebl of Sun Prairie said he won’t seek reelection this fall. He said he wants to focus on his personal life, travel with his wife and family and spend more time with his grandchildren. Hebl, 70, has served in the Assembly since 2004. Seven Assembly Democrats have now announced they won’t run again in November. Thirteen Republicans have announced their retirement from the chamber. Six senators, including three Democrats and three Republicans, have said they’re not running again.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney raised almost $3 million in campaign contributions over the first three months of the midterm election year, continuing her record-breaking fundraising streak as she attempts to defend her seat against a Trump-backed challenger. The third-term Wyoming Republican began April with $6.8 million cash on-hand. Her opponent Harriet Hageman began the final four-month stretch leading up to Wyoming’s Aug. 16 Republican primary with more than $1 million in her campaign coffers. Cheney, who chaired the Republican House Conference before being ousted from her post last year, has broken her personal fundraising records in five consecutive quarters and has raised more than $10 million throughout the election cycle, her campaign said in a statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/13/pig-heart-transplants-nuclear-siren-scare-white-bison-return-news-around-states/50484931/", "title": "Pig heart transplants, nuclear siren scare: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: A prisoner who prompted a nationwide manhunt when he disappeared from a jail this spring has been charged with killing the corrections official authorities said helped him escape. Casey White, 38, has been indicted on a murder charge for the shooting death of Vicky White, Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly announced Tuesday. The pair’s disappearance from an Alabama jail in April sparked a national manhunt that came to a bloody end in Indiana, where Casey White was captured, and Vicky White died. The indictment alleges that during the escape, Casey “White caused the death of Vicky White, who died from a gunshot to the head.” The indictment does not specify who pulled the trigger. Authorities have said Vicky White died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Casey White will plead not guilty at an arraignment hearing, defense attorney Mark McDaniel said in a statement. The defense previously pointed blame at Vicky White for the escape, saying Casey White was in her “care and custody” the entire time of his disappearance from jail. Alabama law allows a murder charge if someone “causes the death of any person” while engaging in certain other felonies such as escape or if the person “recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to a person.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The U.S. government on Monday agreed to a request from environmental groups to study increasing critical habitat designations in Alaska waters for North Pacific right whales, one of the rarest whale species in the world. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries estimates there are about 30 of the whales left after centuries of hunting, ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements have devastated the species. The agency in 2008 designated about 1,175 square miles in the Gulf of Alaska and approximately 35,460 square miles in the southeast Bering Sea as critical habitat for the whales. Two groups, the Center for Biological Diversity and Save the North Pacific Right Whale, in March petitioned the agency to expand the habitat by connecting the existing two areas. This would extend the Bering Sea boundary west and south to Alaska’s Fox Islands, through Unimak Pass to the edge of the continental slope, the agency said in a statement. The proposal would also extend the critical habitat area off Kodiak Island east to the Gulf of Alaska to include new feeding grounds the Center for Biological Diversity has said were confirmed by new research.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The leader of the state’s largest abortion provider said Tuesday that her organization will not resume the procedures in one county even though a federal judge has blocked a fetal “personhood” law that abortion rights advocates feared could lead to criminal charges against doctors and others. Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona, blamed “vague and confusing” statements from Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich about a near-total pre-statehood ban on abortions for the decision. That law has been on the books since at least 1901 but has been blocked since shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade. That injunction covers Pima County, home to Tucson, so the judge’s decision on the personhood law left open the possibility abortions would resume in Tucson. Brnovich announced last month that the pre-1901 law was enforceable and that his office would seek to have that injunction lifted, although it has not yet done so. “We are not going to put our patients, staff and communities at risk especially when a majority of our frontline providers and patients identify as POC, LGBTQ or immigrants and we know that the criminal justice system is particularly cruel to those communities,” Forteno said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A burn ban has been issued in Sebastian County due to hot weather and a lack of rainfall, County Judge David Hudson said Monday. The ban prohibits burning outdoors of trash, debris, brush or other materials while conditions are extremely hot and dry. “We urge all citizens to work together to protect the lives and property, themselves, their families and neighbors,” Hudson said. “The burning ban will stay in existence until sufficient rain has reduced the fire hazard.” Sebastian County has not had significant rainfall in over a month, and the forecast showed several more days of triple-digit heat with no rain through Sunday. The high temperature each day is expected to be near or above 100 degrees with higher heat indices. “Lawns, fields and wooded areas are exceptionally dry, and the flashpoint for outdoor fires is unusually low. Without any significant rain, conditions will continue to dry out vegetation and spread fire more quickly,” Hudson said Monday. Winds can make wildfires hard to contain and pose a hazard to firefighters who battle outdoor blazes in dry, hot weather. The fine for violators of the ban could be $25 to $300.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A TikTok video showing dozens of beachgoers running and jumping out of the way of two fast-moving sea lions has generated nearly 10 million views and sparked conversations about whether the mammals were going after people and reclaiming picturesque La Jolla Cove’s narrow strip of sand. But sea lion expert Eric Otjen of SeaWorld San Diego said what he saw was normal sea lion behavior for this time of year, when males spar as breeding season gets underway. Otjen said the male flopping along at a rapid-fire pace as he darted around people was fleeing the other male closer to the water’s edge that was chasing him because they were likely fighting over which females they could get. Both sea lions had ample opportunities to attack people but instead barreled past them, he said. “He’s got swimmers all around him on his way back out, but they don’t bother him. What this is all about is his right to mate,” Otjen said. “This behavior is not uncommon at all. The reason why the video has gotten like 10 millions views is because everybody is running like Godzilla is chasing them.” And with good reason, he said. “It may look funny that everybody is running, but it’s not a bad choice. You don’t want to be caught in the cross fire. Even if they don’t bite, it’s not a great feeling to have 200 to 300 pounds roll over you.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: People have a right protected by the First Amendment to film police while they work, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday in a decision that concurs with decisions made by six of the nation’s other 12 appeals court. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruling came in the case of a YouTube journalist and blogger who claimed that a suburban Denver officer blocked him from recording a 2019 traffic stop. Citing decisions from the other courts over about two decades as well as First Amendment principles, the 10th Circuit said the right to record police was clearly established at the time and reinstated Abade Irizarry’s lawsuit. A three-judge panel from the court said that “Mr. Irizarry’s right to film the police falls squarely within the First Amendment’s core purposes to protect free and robust discussion of public affairs, hold government officials accountable, and check abuse of power.” While bystander video has played a vital role in uncovering examples of police misconduct in recent years, whether it is a right is still being determined in courts and debated by lawmakers. The nation’s five other appeals courts have not ruled yet on the issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court would likely not get involved unless appeals courts were on opposite sides, said Alan Chen, a University of Denver law professor and one of the First Amendment experts also urged the appeals court to rule in favor of the right of people to record police.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The state is boosting service along two Metro-North rail lines, a move that comes as ridership on the commuter railroad that serves Connecticut and New York moves closer to pre-pandemic levels. Gov. Ned Lamont announced six new express trains on the New Haven Line and seven new weekday trains on the Waterbury Branch Line began service Monday. It marks a 47% increase in service on the Waterbury line, a 27-mile stretch that has undergone safety and infrastructure improvements. “This is the biggest day on the Waterbury Branch ever,” Jim Gildea, chair of the Connecticut Commuter Rail Council and rider on the Waterbury line, said during a news conference in Bridgeport. “This is transformational – transformational not only for the rail commuter such as myself, to get us to our places of destination, but for economic development in the downtowns that this line runs through.” Waterbury Mayor Neil O’Leary said the expanded service coincides with a rise in population in parts of western Connecticut. He said about 4,000 people moved into his city, which is about a two-hour drive from New York City, during the coronavirus pandemic. He said improvements to the rail line were one of the biggest reasons.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A Delaware Superior Court judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by the state’s Democratic attorney general against agricultural giant Monsanto Co. over environmental damage from now-banned toxic chemicals known as PCBs. In recent years, PCBs have been at the center of multimillion-dollar settlements reached between Monsanto and multiple states whose waterways had been contaminated, but Judge Mary Johnston rejected public nuisance, trespass and unjust enrichment claims asserted by Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings. Citing her own 2019 ruling in a lawsuit filed by Jennings against opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma, as well as an earlier lawsuit by the city of Wilmington against gun manufacturers, Judge Mary Johnston noted that Delaware courts do not recognize product-based public nuisance claims. Johnston also said the state has no standing to bring trespass claims regarding PCB contamination of lands and waterways. The judge said while the state may have regulatory control of land and water, there is no basis to support the notion that it has exclusive possession of water. She also pointed out that the state had not alleged that Monsanto had control of the PCBs at the time of the alleged trespass.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington has announced dates and participating restaurants for next month’s Summer Restaurant Week, WUSA-TV reports. The summer promotion is happening from Monday, Aug. 15, through Sunday, Aug. 21. Participating restaurants will offer multi-course brunch and lunch menus for $25 per person and multi-course dinner menus for $40 or $55 per person for on-premises dining. Many restaurants will also offer cocktail pairings and to-go dinner meals, available at two price points: $70 or $100 for two people and $140 or $200 for four people. “Diners across the region can look forward to what will be a delicious promotion celebrating the season’s summer flavors with menus at great price points,” Kathy E. Hollinger, president and CEO of RAMW, said in a statement “This promotion is designed to give the most options for patrons as they dine their way around our great region.” This year’s slate of restaurants includes some returning heavy-hitters in the D.C. food scene, such as Michelin Star winners Cranes and Bresca, as well as some fresh faces, like the just-opened Il Piatto Italian restaurant and Annabelle, which features a menu crafted by a former White House chef who served three presidents.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A majority of Sunshine State residents oppose the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights, according to a new poll that also shows strong support in Florida for the gun violence prevention law recently signed by President Joe Biden. However, Floridians give Biden lower marks than Gov. Ron DeSantis on everything from his handling of the economy to COVID-19 and race relations. Just 34% of Floridians approve of Biden’s economic stewardship, according to the survey by the University of South Florida and Florida International University, compared with 50% who think DeSantis is doing a good job with the economy. The survey provides a snapshot of how Floridians view the abortion issue in the wake of last month’s blockbuster ruling striking down Roe, with 57% saying they oppose the decision. There are a wide range of opinions on what Florida policymakers should do next on abortion but little interest in banning the procedure in most or all cases, according to the survey. Just 9% of Floridians said they want a complete abortion ban, while 21% said they want a ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk. DeSantis celebrated Roe being overturned and has promised to “expand pro-life protections.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican U.S. Reps. Jodi Hice and Andrew Clyde are calling on the University of Georgia to end any support for a “Crisis Pregnancy Center” mapping website developed by two professors. Andrea Swartzendruber and Danielle Lambert, both professors in the College of Public Health, created the website, which allows users to identify crisis pregnancy centers in a given city, state or ZIP code. Crisis pregnancy centers offer pregnancy testing and other limited medical services. They are often funded by religious and conservative groups and attempt to dissuade women from getting abortions, according to the website. The website says the centers “frequently provide inaccurate and misleading health information,” and it calls them “fake women’s health centers.” The purpose of the map is to allow people to identify the centers and help facilitate academic research into the centers. Hice and Clyde sent a letter to UGA President Jere Morehead on Saturday demanding that the university end any support for the mapping website. “The website is ... clearly nothing more than pro-abortion activism masquerading as academic research,” the letter said. Although it does not appear to be hosted on a UGA website, the letter points to the use of a UGA email address by the website’s creators as evidence of alleged university involvement.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Three former state prison guards were found guilty of civil rights violations for assaulting an inmate and trying to cover it up, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. A U.S. judge ordered Jason Tagaloa, Craig Pinkney and Jonathan Taum into custody after a jury convicted them last week, the department said. A fourth former correctional officer, Jordan DeMattos, previously pleaded guilty for his role in the 2015 assault and cover-up, and he testified for the government at the three-week trial, federal prosecutors said. The Hawaii Department of Public Safety fired the men in 2016. “Justice has been served as those involved were held accountable,” Public Safety Director Max Otani said in a statement. “The Department will not tolerate this type of behavior from any employee.” The guards punched and kicked the inmate while he was lying facedown in a pool of his own blood in the recreation yard at Hawaii Community Correctional Center on the Big Island, prosecutors said. They later wrote false reports omitting the beating, prosecutors said. They face up to 10 years in prison for depriving the inmate’s rights, 20 years for the false report and five years for conspiracy.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: An insurance company that covers counties and other public entities in the state says it won’t renew Canyon County’s insurance policy because of increasing risks and a high volume of claims. The Idaho Counties Risk Management Program sent a letter to Canyon County officials May 23 citing “numerous factors including adverse claim development and increasing risk exposures,” the Idaho Press reports. The Nampa-based newspaper obtained the document through public records requests. Canyon County Public Information Officer Joe Decker said the county’s elected officials were not able to offer comment on the ongoing situation. “We are working to evaluate all options, including potential renewal with ICRMP and the potential acquisition of replacement coverage,” Decker wrote in an email. “More information will be forthcoming when available.” Canyon County Commissioners responded to ICRMP in a June 2 letter that suggested the county might appeal the non-renewal notice. They took issue with the decision, saying that “the abruptness and comprehensiveness of this total separation, and the lack of warning or opportunity to cure any perceived issue, is shocking.” The commissioners also said the insurance company’s documentation showing the county’s “loss history” isn’t accurate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mourners shared memories and tears Tuesday during the funeral for the mother of a 2-year-old boy who lost both his parents in the attack on a suburban Independence Day parade, and they pledged to care for young Aiden McCarthy and ensure he shares in their memories of his mom and dad. Irina McCarthy, 35, and husband Kevin McCarthy died on the parade route in Highland Park on July 4. Strangers cared for their young son in the chaotic hours following the barrage of gunfire that killed seven people and wounded more than 30. A photo of the boy’s round-cheeked face spread online, eventually helping authorities to reunite him with his mother’s parents, who had lost their only daughter. Irina McCarthy’s friends who spoke during the funeral in Wilmette, Illinois, remembered her as a big-hearted, dedicated woman who cherished her relationship with her parents and threw herself into marriage and motherhood. Each speaker pledged to remain a part of Aiden’s life and make sure he hears stories of his parents, noting his own cheerful approach to life that echoes his mother’s smile and can-do attitude. “(Aiden) will be cared for by all of us,” said Vic Lichtenberg, a friend of Irina’s parents. “He will have a family, a home, and he’ll thrive and grow with us. Every moment, every time I look at that child, I see Irina.”\n\nIndiana\n\nNew Castle: Federal prosecutors have charged a former eastern Indiana police officer with civil rights violations, alleging he used excessive force during three arrests, including by kicking a man in the head and shooting another with beanbags from close range. The U.S. attorney’s office announced Friday that former New Castle police Officer Aaron J. Strong has been indicted on three counts of “deprivation (of civil rights) under color of law” and a single count of witness tampering. According to the charging documents, Strong, 44, kicked a man “in and about the head” during an arrest July 12, 2017. On the same day, he used a beanbag shotgun to shoot another man “at close range” in the back during an arrest, prosecutors allege. The federal grand jury that indicted Strong found that both of those incidents took place “without legal justification” and resulted in injuries to both men. The third incident for which Strong was indicted stemmed from a 2019 arrest in which he allegedly used an expandable baton to repeatedly strike a man who had reportedly already surrendered. That man later filed a federal lawsuit accusing Strong of hitting him more than 20 times with the baton, resulting in injuries to his “head, jaw, arms and back.” The 2019 encounter also led to Strong’s conviction on a misdemeanor count of criminal recklessness.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An assistant attorney general is suing the city and its police chief over his arrest during a June 2020 racial justice protest, alleging he was tackled, pepper-sprayed and handcuffed for no reason. The lawsuit filed by Assistant Attorney General Paxton Williams is among at least eight cases filed against Des Moines police. The cases involve protests following George Floyd’s death in the custody of Minneapolis police. Paxton, who is Black, alleges police used unnecessary and excessive force in arresting him in front of his home, a few blocks from the Iowa Capitol. The lawsuit, filed May 31 in Polk County District Court, says Williams felt the effects of the pepper spray for several days and suffered shoulder, arm and hip pain. According to court records, a failure-to-disperse citation that Williams received was dismissed under an agreement requiring him to avoid further criminal charges for six months. A representative for the police department did not immediately respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment about the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, Lynn Hicks, declined to comment, calling it a “personal matter.” Paxton also is suing a police sergeant and 10 unnamed officers. Paxton alleges the sergeant told him hours after his arrest that police video refuted Paxton’s claims.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Opponents and supporters of a proposed anti-abortion amendment to the Kansas Constitution are trying to reach suburban Johnson County voters to state their case on the hotly debated issue, dealing with historically hot weather as their door-knocking campaign ramps up. Both sides have spent millions in television advertisements and campaign activities in recent weeks. And opponents and advocates alike for the amendment are attempting to use the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, striking down the long-standing Roe v. Wade decision protecting abortion rights nationally, to motivate their supporters into turning out for the Aug. 2 vote. As volunteers canvassed houses recently, some voters were engaged and could nearly read back the talking points to volunteers. One was attempting to urge his daughter to vote on the amendment by absentee ballot from Malaysia, where she was on an internship. The vote is on whether the state constitution confers a right to an abortion. A “yes” vote would give the Legislature significantly more power to restrict or even outlaw the practice, though lawmakers would still need to vote to do so. Kansas will be the first state where voters will weigh in on abortion following the Dobbs decision.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has struck down a measure that would have weakened Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s appointment authority over a key ethics commission by shifting power to Republican officials to select a majority of the members. In his ruling Monday, Jefferson Circuit Judge McKay Chauvin said the measure severely “diminishes and diverts” the governor’s constitutional duty to ensure the state’s executive branch ethics code is “faithfully executed.” By shifting appointment authority away from the governor, the law empowered other constitutional officers who aren’t “charged with that same constitutional duty,” he said. The GOP-dominated Legislature passed the measure – House Bill 334 – this year over Beshear’s veto. The new law was set to take effect Thursday but is now blocked by the judge’s decision. Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s office said the ruling will be appealed. Under the measure, five statewide officeholders – currently all Republicans – each would make one appointment to the reconstituted state Executive Branch Ethics Commission. The governor would appoint two members to the panel that enforces the executive branch ethics code. The measure would have removed all five current commission members – all gubernatorial appointees.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Despite some Republicans hoping to overturn the governor’s recent vetoes, the GOP-dominated Legislature voted not to hold an override session this week. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards rejected 29 pieces of recently passed legislation, all but one authored by Republican lawmakers. Under Louisiana state law, an override session is automatically scheduled when a governor vetoes legislation, unless a majority of lawmakers in either chamber say it’s not necessary. Historically, a majority of representatives and senators send in ballots saying that the session is not needed. However, since 2021, the Legislature has returned to the Capitol twice to override the governor’s vetoes. Lawmakers had until the end of Monday to send in ballots opposing an override session. Twenty-five of the 37 senators and 39 of the 105 representatives returned ballots. With a majority of the Senate voting against the session, it was canceled, Senate President Page Cortez and House Speaker Clay Schexnayder announced in a letter Tuesday morning. Bills vetoed by Edwards, following the 2022 regular legislative session, included legislation that would have toughened criminal sentences and banned government entities from denying building entry based on a person’s COVID-19 vaccination status.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state has added a suite of new rules designed to cut down on catalytic converter thefts from cars. Catalytic converters are sometimes targeted by thieves because they contain precious metals and are fairly easy to detach from a car. The Legislature has passed a law that puts safeguards into the chain of custody for the converters to try to stop thefts. The rules require car dealers to engrave the auto’s vehicle identification number onto the catalytic converter. Recyclers must also engrave or permanently mark either the VIN or their license and stock number. The state’s new rules also require residents who remove unmarked catalytic converters to engrave or mark the converter with the VIN. The state’s new rules go into effect Aug. 8. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the thefts “an infuriating trend” and said the new law would “provide some peace of mind to Mainers who are worried they may be next.” The number of incidents of catalytic converter theft has spiked around the country over the past three years.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A video in which a Wicomico County Board of Education member’s teenage son holds a rifle and says a threatening statement against Black people, using a racial slur, was shared among students at Parkside High School on one of the last days of the school year. The community was already on edge – two days before the video was shared, in mid-June, Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office deputy Cpl. Glenn Hilliard, a Black man, was killed in the line of duty in Pittsville. Front of mind nationwide was the killing a few weeks prior of 19 children and two adults in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Wicomico County Board of Education member Tonya Lewis’s 15-year-old son was holding what was later determined to be a pellet rifle in the video. Wicomico County public schools issued a statement the week the video was shared assuring the public the incident was being investigated and saying, among other things: “We are shocked and revolted by both the language and the visual content of this video.” The statement noted federal law prohibits the school district from revealing information about individual students. The sheriff’s office announced June 29 that the teen was being charged with misuse of electronic mail and disturbing school activities, both misdemeanors.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: A Boston suburb that was the birthplace of two of the nation’s earliest presidents is planning to build a center honoring their legacies. Quincy officials on Tuesday announced the formation of a new nonprofit foundation to raise money and oversee the design and construction of the Adams Presidential Center honoring former President John Adams and his son, former President John Quincy Adams, as well as former first ladies Abigail Adams and Louisa Catherine Adams. Mayor Thomas Koch said the announcement marks the beginning of a formal, public process for building the “long overdue” center, which he hopes will offer more than a traditional presidential library and museum. “We’re in the infant stages, but we envision it as a center for civic engagement, a place to really get some education about the history of our country,” he said during remarks at the Adams Academy. The mayor has proposed the historic former school as a future home for the center. The school was built in the 1800s using money John Adams left to the city of Quincy, which is named after Abigail Adams’ grandfather, Col. John Quincy. Koch has also asked the Boston Public Library to transfer John Adams’ collection of more than 3,000 books to the city to serve as a focal point of the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state’s largest district court and bail reform advocates have agreed to settle a federal class-action lawsuit over cash bail practices, which activists say routinely and unconstitutionally jail poor and working-class defendants despite evidence of their inability to pay. Both sides say the reforms announced Tuesday strike at racial inequality in the criminal legal system. On any given day in Wayne County – which includes Detroit, the nation’s Blackest city – nearly three-quarters of those jailed are Black, a proportion much higher than their share of the population. If the reforms narrow that disparity, it could be a model for court systems nationwide, where race and wealth are significant factors in the administration of justice, advocates say. Detroit’s 36th District Court, the American Civil Liberties Union and The Bail Project, a nonprofit that pays bail for people in need, said the status quo wreaks unnecessary havoc on defendants’ jobs, homes and families. “This is a historic agreement that we believe can and should be a template for how courts around the country can adapt their bail practices to what is lawful, constitutional and sensible,” said Phil Mayor, senior staff attorney for the Michigan ACLU.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A farmer is accused of making $46 million by passing off chemically treated corn and soybeans as organically grown. James Clayton Wolf has been charged in federal court with felony wire fraud. Prosecutors say Wolf falsely labeled crops grown on his rural Cottonwood County farm as organic, defrauded grain buyers and undermined the nation’s organic labeling system. Organic farming uses seeds from non-genetically modified organisms. Crops are grown without chemicals or fertilizers and generate higher prices at market than non-organic crops. Organic crop certification is controlled by the federal National Organic Program, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The grand jury’s indictment says Wolf’s organic farming certification was revoked in 2020. However, according to the document, Wolf continued selling non-GMO grain falsely labeled as organic through an “associate,” the Star Tribune reports. “Mr. Wolf is a 65-year-old career farmer, who has never been in trouble,” said Paul Engh, his attorney. “He’s led a good life and now seeks his vindication.” Wolf is scheduled to appear before a magistrate judge July 22.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Animal shelters across the Mississippi Gulf Coast are coping with too many animals and too few staffers and volunteers. The Sun Herald reports that one shelter, the Jackson County Animal Shelter, is being forced to considering euthanizing healthy, adoptable dogs. Kennels are stacked on top of one another with dogs of all ages and breeds at the Humane Society of South Mississippi in Gulfport. The shelter has 500 animals, more than it can handle. “It’s a capacity crisis,” said Katie King, the shelter’s development director. The Humane Society, like many other businesses and organizations on the Gulf Coast, is struggling to fill job vacancies during a tight labor market. It’s a similar story at the Jackson County Animal Shelter. When the Jackson County shelter is at its capacity, staffers are forced to euthanize animals that are not considered adoptable – those that are aggressive or so sick they cannot be treated by the shelter’s vets. “But we are running short on animals that are not adoptable, and we are fearful that we will have to do some that are to make space,” shelter director Joseph Barlow said. HSSM and the Jackson County Animal Shelter are looking for volunteers, as well as donations including cleaning supplies, food, treats and more.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Two leading Democratic state lawmakers on Monday asked the Republican governor to call a special session to pass legislation that would safeguard contraception and medical treatment for ectopic pregnancies after a near-total ban on abortion was instituted. Senate Minority Leader John Rizzo, of Independence, and House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, of Springfield, wrote in a letter to Gov. Mike Parson that medical and legal experts have “expressed concern and confusion” since the state law banning abortion except in “cases of medical emergency” took effect last month. Most notably, a large Missouri hospital chain briefly stopped providing emergency contraception, fearing that doctors who provide the medication could be at risk of criminal charges, even in cases of sexual assault. Quade said in a phone interview that constituents have called “fearful of whether or not they can get their birth control, if they can get the morning-after pill. What do they do with their IVF treatments, ectopic pregnancy, etc. You know, there’s still a lot of confusion around what the actual law means in the state of Missouri in terms of who can be prosecuted and what is covered.” Parson had already said he plans to call a special session to deal with tax cuts; Democrats want abortion added to the agenda to provide clarity.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native American leaders throughout the state are pushing for the return of a sacred white bison that has been housed at the Montana State Historical Society since his death in 1959. Big Medicine is the name given a white bison calf born on the range in 1933, The Daily Montanan reports. Not an albino, Big Medicine had a mostly white coat with a tuft of brown that sometimes appeared near his horns. Many Indigenous cultures, including the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes, regarded the birth as an omen of good fortune and renewed hope, and Big Medicine was kept alive on the range for 26 years, nearly triple the age of the average bull bison. The display at the Montana State Historical Society is right across from the archives on the second floor, and he remains one of the most popular attractions. However, the Montana Native American Caucus has supported the effort by the CSKT to bring Big Medicine home, back to where he lived, to be a part of a planned museum and interpretative center. Molly Kruckenberg, executive director of the historical society, said while the decision to return Big Medicine to the CSKT is in the hands of the society’s board of trustees, staff generally support the effort so long as the animal, in somewhat fragile condition, can be returned safely and preserved for the next generation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A newly formed nonprofit says it wants to create a community center for LGBTQ+ people in the metro area and as far away as western Iowa, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert has thrown her support behind the effort by Omaha ForUs, which said support groups and mental health services would be among the offerings it hopes the center can provide. JohnCarl Denkovich, director of programs for Omaha ForUs, said the city is among just seven in the 50 biggest U.S. cities without such a center in its metro area, according to the newspaper.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Homicides are down in Clark County in the first half of this year, but authorities say gun violence and domestic killings remain a real concern. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports at least eight people were killed because of domestic violence in the metro area in the first six months of 2022. Across Clark County, 89 people have been killed between Jan. 1 and June 30, including 74 deaths that were investigated by the Las Vegas Metro Police. Across all departments in the county, police investigated three mass shootings in the first half of this year, according to the Review-Journal. At least 30 homicides in the county involved men killed during a fight with another man. “Perceived disrespect associated with social media and in-person fighting has become a significant issue,” Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told the Review-Journal. “Instead of reacting with their words and feet and hands, now they’re reacting with guns, and that is a disturbing trend.” County authorities had investigated 104 killings by July 1, 2021 – 15 more than this year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State homeland security officials said Tuesday that a siren was inadvertently activated at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station and that there was no emergency and no danger to the public. The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and plant owner NextEra Energy Resources put out statements more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements about 11 a.m. about the beaches being closed because of a problem at the plant. “We are aware of the sirens calling for an evacuation near Seabrook Station,” said Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for plant. “The sirens’ activation was sent in error during testing of the system. ... Seabrook Station is currently operating with no issues that impact the nearby community. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.” Police and fire departments in the area said the beaches were not closed. “The Seabrook Station Alert was inadvertent there is NO EMERGENCY,” the Hampton Fire Department posted on Facebook. The plant is about 40 miles north of Boston and 10 miles south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Workers at five casinos have ratified new contracts giving them significant raises and are now turning their attention to the two that have yet to settle, their union said Tuesday. Officials with Local 54 of the Unite Here union said 99% of workers who voted in ratification elections Monday approved the new pacts, under which housekeeping employees will immediately see their hourly salary increased to $18, up from varying levels at different casinos. Their pay will increase to $22 per hour at the end of the four-year contract. “It’s hard to sell a housekeeping job at $16 an hour,” said union President Bob McDevitt. “It’s a lot easier to sell one at $20 or $22 an hour.” He said the strike authorization vote is a way to prepare for the possibility that a work stoppage may be needed. “Casino workers have needed raises for a long time,” said Dave Dorfman, a cook at Harrah’s and member of the worker negotiating committee. “Now there is an easier way forward for us, and the money will go a long way towards affording my daily expenses. Next, we need to make sure that Resorts and Golden Nugget workers don’t get left behind.” The union plans to vote July 19 on whether to authorize a strike at those two casinos if new deals are not reached by then.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State regulators said Monday that several horses that were feared dead by animal advocates following a weekend of racing at one of the state’s premiere horse tracks are alive and well. Officials with the New Mexico Racing Commission said that only one animal died after being injured during recent trials at Ruidoso Downs and that photographs and veterinary reports submitted to the state show the other seven were in their stalls and were fine. The Washington, D.C.-based group Animal Wellness Action had raised concerns about the horses’ welfare. “Apparently it was so brutally hot the horses had to be vanned back to the stables after they ran, which of course to us means they shouldn’t have been running in the first place,” said Marty Irby, the lobbying group’s executive director. Irby leveled his criticisms as advocates push for track owners and regulators nationwide to be more vigilant now that new federal safety mandates took effect this month and as the industry prepares to adopt more uniform anti-doping rules. Irby was among those who testified before Congress in support of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, which was signed into law in 2020. It is being implemented in stages, with the racetrack safety program starting first. The anti-doping and medication rules are expected in early 2023.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Researchers at NYU Langone Health transplanted pig hearts into two brain-dead people over the past month – the latest in a string of developments in the long quest to one day save human lives with animal organs. The experiments announced Tuesday come after a historic but failed attempt earlier this year to use a pig’s heart to save a dying Maryland man – sort of a rehearsal before scientists try again in the living. “We learned so much from the first one that the second one is much better,” said Dr. Nader Moazami, who led the operations at NYU Langone Health. “You stand there in awe” when the pig heart starts to beat in a human body, he said. This time around, Moazami’s team mimicked how heart transplants routinely are done. Once last month and once last week, researchers traveled to a facility housing genetically modified pigs, removed the needed hearts, put them on ice and flew them hundreds of miles back to New York. They used special new methods to check for any worrisome animal viruses before sewing the heart into the chest of each deceased recipient – a Vietnam veteran from Pennsylvania with a long history of heart disease and a New York woman who’d benefited from a transplant earlier in life. Then came three days of more intense testing than living patients could tolerate before doctors disconnected life support.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal judge has blocked state laws that greatly restrict who can help people with disabilities request absentee ballots, fill them out and return them. A disabled person needing help to vote by mail can now seek assistance from anyone they choose, not just from a close relative or legal guardian as state law has limited, the State Board of Elections told county election officials after the decision filed Monday by U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle. He declared that such restraints in state law conflict with the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows people who are blind, can’t read or write, or have a disability to pick whomever they wish to assist them, save for the voter’s employer or union. The elimination of these restrictions applies to all citizens with such disabilities, not just the thousands who reside in hospitals, clinics or nursing homes, Boyle ruled in a lawsuit filed last September against the state board by the nonprofit Disability Rights North Carolina. “Voting is a fundamental right in this country, and these barriers not only violated federal law, they effectively denied the dignity, autonomy and humanity of disabled people by preventing their full participation in voting,” Disability Rights North Carolina CEO Virginia Knowlton Marcus said in a news release Tuesday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to legalize recreational marijuana turned in more than 25,000 signatures to the secretary of state Monday in an effort to place the matter before voters in November. The group, New Approach North Dakota, needed 15,582 signatures to get the measure on the ballot for the general election. The organization’s campaign manager, David Owen, said all the additional signatures they gathered show there is broad support for legalization. “We’ve had signature-gatherers in Fargo, Grand Forks, Bismarck, Minot, Williston …we were at Country Fest this weekend in New Salem. This was a campaign that was done in less than 100 days, and we averaged 2,000 signatures a week the whole way through,” Owen told KFGO. “We think that this really shows true, strong support across the state, the fact that we were able to get so many people to sign.” Secretary of State Al Jaeger’s office has 35 days to review the signatures and determine if enough of the petitions are valid to place the measure on the ballot. The New Approach initiative would allow people 21 and older to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts of cannabis. Public consumption of marijuana would not allowed under the proposed provision.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A Franklin County judge described the ongoing effort to put a “green energy” initiative on the ballot in city elections as an illegitimate attempt to steal taxpayer money when he sentenced its leader Tuesday to 120 days in jail for filing a false campaign finance report in 2019. Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Chris M. Brown also sentenced John A. Clark Jr., 50, to pay a $2,500 fine, work 250 hours of community service and serve five years of probation. “I’m specifically going to ask the community service be through the Columbus Parks Department so you can work with the people you were trying to steal money from. You’ll work in programs that would’ve been shut down had you been successful,” Brown said. Clark has led multiple petition drives in recent years to get a “green energy” initiative put on the Columbus ballot that, if any had passed, would have diverted more than $40 million of taxpayer money from the city budget toward ProEnergy Ohio LLC, a limited partnership group led by Clark. After a back-and-forth with the City Council and the courts, a version of the initiative that would have redirected $87 million to ProEnergy Ohio made it onto the ballot last November. It was soundly defeated. One of Clark’s attorneys said they’ll appeal the sentence, which they feel was overly harsh.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Three proposed new turnpike routes were approved Monday by the Oklahoma Transportation Commission despite concerns by one member about the process being rushed and the absence of a member representing threatened homeowners. The turnpikes are part of Access Oklahoma, a $5 billion, 15-year expansion of the state’s turnpike network that opponents say will uproot hundreds of homes and businesses where new toll roads are proposed between south Oklahoma City and Norman. PIKE OFF, a grassroots group battling the three turnpikes, unsuccessfully asked the commission to delay a vote until a new District 3 representative could be appointed by Oklahoma House Speaker Charles McCall. John Estus, House spokesman, said the appointment, required after the seat was vacated by T.W. Shannon, is one of hundreds requiring McCall’s attention. “While this is a recent vacancy, it has been prioritized and will be filled very soon,” Estus said. “Nobody has advised the speaker’s office on why the vote on this matter occurred before the appointment was made.” Secretary of Transportation Tim Gatz said the routes approved Monday can still be adjusted based on talks with property owners and other considerations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Forestry officials said Monday that an invasive beetle known for decimating ash trees throughout North America and Europe was recently discovered west of Portland – a first for the West Coast. The Oregon Department of Forestry said the iridescent green emerald ash borer is considered the most destructive forest pest in North America and had been detected in 34 other states before it was discovered in Forest Grove on June 30, KOIN-TV reports. Officials said it’s the first discovery of the insect on the West Coast. The beetle is believed to have come from Asia through Canada to the U.S. about 20 years ago. The insects have killed up to 99% of the ash trees in some North American locations. The emerald ash borer was discovered in Oregon by Dominic Maze, an invasive species biologist for the city of Portland. He was waiting outside a summer camp in Forest Grove to pick up his children when he noticed several ash trees with D-shaped exit holes in their bark, state officials said. He recognized the holes as a sign of the emerald ash borer and then spotted the beetles. “It’s an ecologically vital tree, as it shades water, keeping it cooler for fish,” said Wyatt Williams, the Oregon Department of Forestry’s invasive species specialist. “The roots stabilize streambanks, reducing erosion.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections agency sued three Republican-controlled county governments Tuesday, seeking to force their election boards to report primary results that include ballots with undated exterior envelopes – the subject of several other lawsuits. The Department of State sued Lancaster, Berks and Fayette counties in Commonwealth Court, describing them as “outlier counties” that have not properly certified vote tallies from the May 17 election that included nominating contests for U.S. Senate, governor and most of the Legislature. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled May 20 that mail-in ballots without a required date on the return envelope must be allowed in a 2021 county judge race in Pennsylvania. Although the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the Senate vote-counting after the primary, three justices signed onto an opinion that said the 3rd Circuit was “very likely wrong.” A Commonwealth Court judge, in a separate case that was directly about reporting this year’s Senate primary election results, ruled June 2 that county boards of election should count mail-in votes that lack the security envelopes’ handwritten dates and report vote totals both with and without those ballots.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Low-income people who are charged with crimes will be spared from paying court costs and fees if they prove to the court they don’t have the financial means to pay those debts, under a new state law. Recognizing court costs can prove an insurmountable hurdle for some people that can tie them to the courts, state lawmakers this past session passed legislation that eliminates all costs, assessments and fees for those determined to be indigent. Such costs will also be waived for anyone who serves more than 30 days in prison under the law enacted late last month. “It’s done a great deal of healing and relief for those who have been in the system for too many years, too long,” said Cedric Huntley, executive director of the Nonviolence Institute. Huntley recalled one man finally feeling free to get his driver’s license after a judge waived his court costs. “It gives people an opportunity to explore other opportunities. It changed the way he viewed the system,” Huntley said. Previously, state law specified that judges “may” waive fees for those unable to pay, but that lenience was applied unevenly by judges. Under the new law, the fees will be automatically eliminated for the indigent and those serving sentences longer than 30 days.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The nation’s ninth-busiest port is at risk of pollution by more than 100,000 gallons of fuel from a Navy aircraft carrier that served in World War II and the Vietnam War before its decommissioning and designation as a National Historic Landmark. The USS Yorktown, located in Charleston Harbor, is experiencing continued corrosion on its outer hull. If hazardous materials leak into the harbor, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster warned it would impair commercial shipping and harm the ecosystem. McMaster – who has supported environmental protection in office but failed to get the endorsement of conservation groups in his 2018 gubernatorial bid – took steps Monday to minimize that risk. Speaking at Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant, the governor announced an executive order directing the state’s Office of Resilience to study the cost of remediation efforts and remove all 140,000 gallons of fuel from the USS Yorktown. The aircraft carrier also picked up the Apollo 8 crew and spacecraft in 1968 after the first human mission to the moon. “This is a special place for a whole lot of reasons,” McMaster said at a Monday afternoon news conference. “It’s been entrusted to us. And we have to be sure that it continues to flourish.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A pair of campaigns trying to expand access to Medicaid through the November ballot announced Monday that they will join efforts to focus on passing an amendment to the state constitution. The announcement from the two organizations – South Dakotans Decide Healthcare and Dakotans for Health – puts to rest a potential rivalry between the two campaigns. Both brought separate ballot proposals to require the state to make Medicaid government health insurance available to people who live below 133% of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $18,000 for an individual or $37,000 for a family of four. South Dakota is one of 12 states that has not accepted federal incentives to expand Medicaid eligibility, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. South Dakotans Decide Healthcare, which is sponsoring Constitutional Amendment D and is backed by the state’s health care industry, said that Dakotans for Health would join its coalition rather than push its own proposal for a voter-initiated measure. “After conversations with South Dakotans Decide Healthcare members, we have agreed that the best path forward to accomplishing this goal is to join efforts behind one campaign,” Rick Weiland, the co-founder of Dakotans for Health, said in a statement.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More of the state’s students met grade-level requirements in reading this year, but the number of students scoring below grade level has also grown. More than 36% of students are on grade level in English language arts, up from about 29% of students last year, according to results from this year’s state assessments. But 25.8% of students are also scoring below grade level – also up from 23.8% of students last year and the highest since 2017. This growing achievement gap is especially acute at some grade levels and among certain groups of students, including Black and Hispanic students and students with disabilities. And it comes as state education officials tout successes in literacy instruction and implementation of statewide efforts to boost reading skills for all students. Students’ TNReady or TCAP scores fall into one of four categories: mastered, on track, approaching and below grade level. A student who tests “on track” is considered proficient for their grade level. This school year, of all students tested from third grade and up, 35.1% of students scored on or above grade level.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s juvenile prison system is giving employees pay raises to address high staff turnover and staffing shortages that prompted officials to stop accepting new children into the facilities last week. Direct-care staff, including correctional officers and case managers, will be getting 15% raises. The salary hikes had been temporary following an emergency measure in April but will now be permanent, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department announced Friday. The raises are “the first step in stabilizing the agency,” said Interim Executive Director Shandra Carter. In a letter sent last month to Texas juvenile probation chiefs but only made public last week, Carter had said her agency would have to temporarily halt the intake of youth to its five state facilities as the juvenile justice department was “hemorrhaging” staff. Following media reports in 2007 that detailed physical and sexual abuse in state facilities and raised concerns with state judges and lawmakers, the Texas Juvenile Justice Department has worked to improve conditions at its facilities. In a May report to the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission, the agency’s ombudsman said a leadership overhaul due to “persistent problems” at the juvenile prison system, including on ongoing federal probe, has failed to address the primary cause of the agency’s current turmoil: chronic staff shortages.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A judge on Monday granted a request from Planned Parenthood to delay implementing the state’s trigger law banning most abortions, as implications of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade reverberate nationwide. With the decision, abortion remains legal up to 18 weeks in Utah, which is among a group of states where abortion rights have been thrown into limbo amid the legal and political challenges shaping the post-Roe landscape with states now holding the power to restrict abortion. “What I’m really doing is saying we have serious things to talk about,” Judge Andrew Stone said after granting an injunction delaying the trigger law. He said the status quo should remain in effect until a challenge from the state’s Planned Parenthood affiliate can be heard fully. Utah is among more than a dozen states with trigger laws designed to limit abortion upon the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The decision Monday comes two weeks after the court put a temporary hold on the law, which bans most abortions with exceptions for rape, incest or maternal health. Stone, appointed by a Republican governor, blocked its enforcement for 14 days after the state’s branch of Planned Parenthood sued. His decision effectively extends the hold and allows Planned Parenthood clinics to continue providing abortions until the case is resolved.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The newly established Vermont State University unifying three state schools has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Education, the Vermont State College System announced Tuesday. Vermont State University will be composed of Castleton University, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College and will welcome its first class in the fall of 2023. Consolidation talks started in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, as increasing costs and declining student enrollment exacerbated the college system’s financial challenges. “Achieving accreditation for Vermont State University is monumental,” Lynn Dickinson, chair of the Vermont State Colleges System Board of Trustees, said in a statement. “Accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Education recognizes our strategic planning work, holds us accountable for maintaining high educational standards, and ensures we make continuous quality improvements for our students.” Vermont State University will launch next July and open applications for its inaugural class in the coming months, said President Parwinder Grewal.\n\nVirginia\n\nLeesburg: A judge on Monday rejected an effort by the Loudoun County School Board to shut down a special grand jury investigating the school system’s handling of two sexual assaults. The school board has said the special grand jury empaneled by Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares is politically motivated and illegally usurps the mandate in the Virginia Constitution giving local school boards authority over educational affairs. Miyares argued that the special grand jury he empaneled is needed to uncover why the school system allowed a boy who had been accused of sexually assaulting a girl in one high school to transfer to another high school, where he was convicted of sexually assaulting a second girl. Miyares launched the grand jury after Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on his first day in office, issued an executive order requesting an investigation by the attorney general’s office. Both Youngkin and Miyares had criticized the Loudoun County board in their successful 2021 political campaigns. They argued the board was not forthcoming in how it handled the case as it revised its guidelines over policies governing transgender students. The assaults attracted national attention in part because the boy – who was convicted in juvenile court – was wearing a skirt when he committed at least one of the attacks.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The Biden administration on Tuesday released two reports arguing that removing dams on the lower Snake River may be needed to restore salmon runs to sustainable levels in the Pacific Northwest and that replacing the energy created by the dams is possible but will cost $11 billion to $19 billion. The reports were released by the White House Council on Environmental Quality. “Business as usual will not restore salmon,” said Brenda Mallory, chair of the council. “The Columbia River system is the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest.” If the four Snake River dams were ultimately removed, it would be largest such project in U.S. history. In 2012 the Elwha Dam on Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula was removed to restore habitat. At the time, the National Park Service said the elimination of the Elwha Dam was the largest such project in U.S. history. Many salmon runs continue to decline, which environmentalists blame on dams, Mallory said, and her office is leading multi-agency efforts to restore “abundant runs of salmon to the Columbia River Basin.” Mallory cautioned that the Biden administration is not endorsing any single long-term solution, including breaching the dams.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The speed limit on two roads near Marshall University have been temporarily reduced while officials conduct a traffic study to determine if permanent changes are needed for pedestrian safety. Crews with the West Virginia Division of Highways installed new signs near the campus last week that reduce the speed limit on 3rd and 5th avenues from 35 mph to 25 mph, The Herald-Dispatch reports. The move stems from ongoing discussions among Huntington Mayor Steve Williams, Marshall University administrators and officials with the West Virginia Division of Highways following the death of a Marshall student last year who was struck by a vehicle on 3rd Avenue while crossing the street at the crosswalk. Days after Cox’s death, Williams asked the Division of Highways to conduct a traffic safety audit on the streets around Marshall’s campus. The study is ongoing, and officials are reviewing possible safety measures. Depending on the recommendations from the study, the speed limit will be evaluated.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A key Republican leader in the state Assembly has decided to resign early to head to a private-sector job rather than wait until his term ends. Majority Leader Jim Steineke announced in January that he wouldn’t seek reelection. He announced Monday that he will resign July 27. He said the Legislature’s two-year session ended in March, and lawmakers aren’t coming back to do anything before the new session starts in January, so it makes sense to enter the private sector now. The Kaukauna Republican was first elected to the Assembly in 2010 and just months later helped pass Act 10, then-Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip most public workers of their union rights. The GOP caucus made him assistant majority leader in 2013 and majority leader in 2015. Republican Reps. Mike Kuglitsch and Tyler Vorpagel also resigned early after announcing they won’t seek reelection. Michael Best Strategies announced it had hired Kuglitsch on June 14, about a month after Kuglitsch announced he wouldn’t run again. Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin officials announced June 6 that they had hired Vorpagel, just five days after he announced he wouldn’t seek reelection. Republican Rep. Samantha Kerkman resigned June 7 after she won election as Kenosha County executive in April.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Citing earthquake safety, workers at the Teton County courthouse say they’re worried about themselves and the public inside the 1968 building, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. In March, a consultant presented county commissioners with the results of an engineering study that found the structure not sonically sound. In addition to judicial facilities, it also houses offices for local first responders, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/25/new-orleans-revelry-overwhelming-stink-right-food-news-around-states/119081162/", "title": "New Orleans revelry, overwhelming stink: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Plagued by a shortage of stadium workers and complaints about long concession lines at home football games during the pandemic, the University of Alabama has contracted with an online app. It also made other changes in hopes of speeding up service during Saturday’s homecoming game against Tennessee. With a capacity crowd of more than 101,000 expected, Alabama said fans could use the Waitr phone system to order food and drinks in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Fans using the system are notified when an order is ready and can then pick up items at windows in the stadium. The Alabama deal is Waitr’s first for a football stadium, although baseball fans have used the app in Louisiana and Mississippi, company spokesman Dean Turcol said. Alabama received complaints about long concession lines after its home game against the University of Mississippi on Oct. 2. Athletics director Greg Byrne said part of the problem was the difficulty finding workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Similar to staffing issues at the gates, an average of 40% of people who were supposed to work concessions on game days end up not showing up leaving them short-handed,” he wrote in a weekly email to supporters at the time. The athletic department said it is also streamlining menus and adding ordering technology to speed up sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman known for 37 years only as Horseshoe Harriet, one of a dozen or so victims of a notorious Alaska serial killer, has been identified through genetic genealogy and a DNA match, authorities said Friday. The victim was identified Friday as Robin Pelkey, who was 19 and living on the streets of Anchorage when she was killed by Robert Hansen in the early 1980s, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation’s Cold Case Investigation Unit said. “I would like to thank all of the troopers, investigators, and analysts that have diligently worked on this case over the last 37 years. Without their hard work and tenacity, the identity of Ms. Pelkey may have never been known,” Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner James Cockrell said in a statement. Hansen, who owned a bakery, gained the nickname “Butcher Baker” for abducting and hunting down women – many of them sex workers – in the wilderness just north of Anchorage through the early 1980s, when the state’s largest city was booming because of construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Construction of the 800-mile pipeline offered well-paying jobs for workers, but it also attracted those looking for fast money and left as quickly as they came. Exotic dancers traveled a circuit along West Coast cities, making sudden disappearances commonplace.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney for members of the San Carlos Apache tribe on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to back a nonprofit group’s efforts to keep a copper mining company from gaining federal Arizona land that the Apaches consider sacred. “We are talking about the survival of the Apache people,” attorney Luke Goodrich told the panel, arguing that an end to religious activities on the land known as Oak Flat would help spell an end to the tribe. Joan Pepin, an attorney for the U.S. government, argued the land transfer must go ahead because it was part of legislation approved by Congress. The land has been set to be transferred to Resolution Copper, as part of a provision in a must-pass 2014 defense bill, once the final environmental impact statement is published. The three-member panel did not immediately release a ruling. The judges will now confer in private and write a decision that may not be issued for as long as three months. Goodrich said the group could take the case to the Supreme Court if the appeals court sides with the U.S. Forest Service, the agency that has planned the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit organization representing tribe members, sued the federal government in Phoenix federal court in January to block the pending transfer of the land near the community of Superior.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A prison transport driver convicted last year of sexually assaulting two female inmates was sentenced Thursday to life in prison plus five years. U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall handed down the sentence to Eric Scott Kindley, 53, for the assaults and knowingly possessing a firearm to further a violent crime. Kindley sexually assaulted the women in 2014 and 2017 while transporting them between lockups on warrants. Kindley operated his own private prisoner transport company that contracted with local jails throughout the country to transport individuals arrested on out-of-state warrants. The federal investigation into Kindley began when two women, housed together at a small jail in Arizona, reported that he sexually assaulted them during two separate trips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Levels of wretched-smelling hydrogen sulfide gas that have plagued south Los Angeles County communities for weeks are declining as authorities use various mitigation methods in a flood control channel emitting the gross odors, authorities said Friday in an online news conference. The problem was reported Oct. 7 and traced to the 15-mile-long Dominguez Channel, which flows into the Los Angeles harbor. The smell has chiefly affected the city of Carson and several other Los Angeles suburbs. The gas is being created by a natural phenomenon called anaerobic digestion, which occurs when bacteria break down vegetation when there’s a lack of oxygen in the water, said Mark Pestrella, the county’s public works director and chief engineer of the flood control district. In addition, the investigation revealed the presence of chemicals that are contributing to the problem. Pestrella did not identify those chemicals and said he could not comment further because it may involve criminal or civil actions. Public works is spraying the channel with a biodegradable odor neutralizer called Epoleon, which converts hydrogen sulfide to a salt. Daily tides are being relied on to spread the neutralizer, and Pestrella said drones are being considered to help that process. A system of bubblers is being installed in the channel to oxygenate the water, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A day care owner convicted of keeping 26 children hidden in the basement of her business two years ago has been sentenced to six years in prison after parents said some of the children still suffer trauma including sleeping problems and anxiety. A judge issued the sentence to Carla Faith on Thursday following her August conviction of more than two dozen misdemeanor child abuse charges and other crimes. Faith was only licensed to care for up to six children at her private day care, and only two were allowed to be under age 2. But police who went to her Mountain Play Place day care in November 2019 found 25 kids in the basement, including 12 under 2 years old, prosecutors said. There were two adult employees supervising them in the basement, and one accepted a plea deal and testified at Faith’s trial, KRDO-TV reports. A 26th child was picked up by a parent while police were on site, authorities said. Many of the children had soiled or wet diapers and were sweaty and thirsty, according to an arrest affidavit. When police arrived, Faith repeatedly told an officer that no children were there and that the home did not have a basement, but the officer heard children’s music and a child’s cry from the basement, the affidavit said. Another officer discovered a false wall and moved it to reveal the basement staircase, the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Employees in the state’s prison system make up more than 32% of state workers who have failed to comply with Gov. Ned Lamont’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to figures released Friday by the governor’s office. Of Connecticut’s 30,623 state workers 1,482 – about 5% – have not been vaccinated or submitted to weekly coronavirus testing as required by the mandate, according to the report. Those include 483 workers at the state Department of Correction, which has about 5,400 employees. The governor’s office had given workers until Oct. 4 to comply with the order. But the state has so far fired just 22 workers and placed an additional 29 on unpaid leave. Officials are in the process of suspending or terminating an additional 70 workers, the governor’s office said. “The majority of employees who are currently out of compliance are working with the state to come into compliance and anticipate coming into compliance in the coming days,” Lamont spokesperson David Bednarz said. The department confirmed Friday that it has seen a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in several prisons, including the Hartford Correctional Center, the New Haven Correctional Center and the Carl Robinson Correctional Center. Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said most of those are asymptomatic cases among inmates.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Nearly every beach town along the state’s coast made more money from parking permits and meters this past summer than in 2020, and most also beat pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. In Lewes, the total parking revenue in 2021, including fees collected from parking tickets, reached just over $1 million – a 17% increase from 2019 and about a 27% jump from 2020. In Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach, this summer’s total parking revenues increased by just over 20% each compared to summer 2019. Their recovery from 2020 revenue was even greater. Dewey Beach’s accounting clerk clarified that the collections from parking fines during a given year may not perfectly reflect how many tickets were issued that year. But even without the revenue from parking citations, Dewey made a huge comeback: Revenue from parking permits and meters alone increased by about a third since 2019. Even as crowds returned to the boardwalks and beaches, though, some signs of the pandemic remained. Rehoboth Beach, for example, maintained its Meterless Mondays – free parking from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. every Monday – and several parking spots were taken up by outdoor dining and reserved spaces for carryout orders. Even so, Rehoboth Beach only fell below its pre-pandemic revenue by $80,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Area commuters will face longer waits for Metro trains through at least the end of the month and probably longer, as more than half the fleet of train cars will remain out of service over safety issues. Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld told reporters Friday that there was no timeline for the return of the transit authority’s 7000-series train cars, which were abruptly pulled from service last week after a derailing revealed a chronic problem with the wheels and axles. Those 748 cars are the newest and constitute more than 60% of the fleet. The derailing is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and Wiedefeld said he couldn’t comment on it while the investigation was ongoing. In the meantime, Wiedefeld said Metro engineers were working to bring older retired cars back into service. But he said the older cars were undergoing rigorous inspections, and he didn’t expect them back in service until early November. Until then, riders can expect longer delays between trains across the system, whose six lines crisscross the city and stretch deep into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The transit authority currently has 268 rail cars in service. There are 180 cars from the older 6000-series trains that may be brought back if they pass inspections. Currently only 22 of them are available for service.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed. Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson, a Republican, sent a memo to senators Saturday regarding the incident at the office of Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions. Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, had not yet made public her breast cancer diagnosis. Polsky told the Associated Press about the tense exchange with state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo that was first reported by news site Florida Politics. She said Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and were asked to wear them when they arrived for the Wednesday meeting. She did not tell him she had breast cancer but said she had a serious condition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity to vaccines. Ladapo had asked to meet her in Tallahassee as he seeks confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month. Polsky said she asked whether there was a reason why he couldn’t wear a mask, but he wouldn’t answer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge is throwing out ethics charges against former Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, saying state officials waited too long to pursue action. Oxendine was accused of illegally using campaign funds from his failed 2010 gubernatorial campaign to buy a house and lease cars. He was also accused of accepting campaign contributions 10 times above the legal limit from insurance companies. Local news outlets report administrative law judge Ronit Walker ruled last week that the statute of limitations on misconduct had passed when ethics officials began to pursue Oxendine in 2015. Walker also ruled that the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission can’t pursue Oxendine for accepting $120,000 in bundled contributions from two insurance companies. “No matter how patently obvious it may be that corporations are ‘affiliated,’ the legislature has chosen only to penalize the donor,” Walker wrote in dismissing the illegal contributions case against Oxendine, citing state law. The ethics complaint against the insurers was dismissed in 2014 because commission staff had made little progress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2016 that Oxendine kept $500,000 in leftover funds from his gubernatorial campaign and kept contributions for a runoff and general election he never saw.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The number of students enrolled at the University of Hawaii’s 10 campuses increased this fall for the first time in a decade. The school’s flagship Manoa campus led the way with a 6% increase, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The university’s first-year class is its largest ever. Overall, the institution’s enrollment is the highest it’s been since 2014. Enrollment at the Hilo campus is up 2.5%. Leeward Community College and Windward Community College posted gains of 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Overall enrollment at UH’s seven community colleges, however, is down 3.2%. Manoa enrollment, officials said, was up in nearly every category, including resident, continental U.S, transfer and international students. UH-Manoa Provost Michael Bruno credited the university for spreading the word about the benefits of a Manoa education. The perception that Hawaii and the Manoa campus in particular have managed the coronavirus pandemic better than most places may have played a role, he said. Hawaii Pacific University had been expecting an enrollment boost before the fall semester began. It was expecting to have 4,000 students this fall, its most ever. Its first-year class was expected to climb from about 500 to more than 800.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: The city is asking a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit brought by an anti-mask group, arguing the group’s members can’t show they’ve actually been harmed by a local face-covering mandate. Hailey and other central Idaho towns surrounding the popular Sun Valley ski resort were at the epicenter of the state’s first major coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. The city enacted its mask mandate – requiring most people to wear masks in public when indoors or outside when social distancing is impossible – in July 2020, and a version of the order has remained in place ever since. Idaho remains one of the least-vaccinated states in the nation, and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have overwhelmed hospitals. A month ago, state public health leaders enacted “crisis standards of care,” allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed to deal with the flood of patients. About a week after the state entered crisis standards of care, an anti-mask organization based hundreds of miles away in the northern Idaho city of Sandpoint sued Hailey on behalf of its members who live in and near the central Idaho town. In the lawsuit, the group said the mask mandate amounted to a “mandatory human experiment” that violates their fundamental human rights.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The mayor has helped launch the installation of new signs renaming the city’s picturesque Lake Shore Drive after a Black man recognized as a key settler of the city. Mayor Lori Lightfoot gathered Thursday with political and community leaders at Buckingham Fountain to kick off the installation of 12 large highway signs declaring the thoroughfare “Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive.” More than 80 smaller street signs that will mark the roadway along the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline read simply: “DuSable Lake Shore Drive,” the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Lightfoot, who had initially opposed renaming Lake Shore Drive, said the $500,000 cost is “worth it” to honor a man who was “forgotten in the annals” of Chicago history. “We needed to find a way to honor our founder,” Lightfoot said. Chicago’s City Council approved the name change in June. DuSable, a native of Haiti, is considered Chicago’s first permanent, non-Indigenous settler. He had a successful trading post in the late 1700s. He died in 1818. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city four years later. Alderman Donald Moore initially proposed changing the name of the ribbon of concrete along Lake Michigan to DuSable Drive two years ago after a riverboat tour of the city in which he said DuSable’s name wasn’t mentioned.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Twitter suspended a congressman’s official account after removing a post about a transgender woman over violation of the social media company’s rules. Twitter’s action Saturday came after Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Banks posted tweets last week regarding Dr. Rachel Levine becoming the first openly transgender four-star officer in the U.S. uniformed services. Banks had responded to the U.S. surgeon general congratulating Levine on her promotion in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by writing: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man.” Now-retired Army Gen. Ann Dunwoody was the first woman in the U.S. military to attain a four-star rank. Banks’ post was removed with a reference to Twitter rules that include a ban on “targeted misgendering” of transgender people. Banks’ official Twitter account remained online Sunday, but he wasn’t allowed to add new posts. His personal account with fewer followers remained active. Banks, whose district covers Fort Wayne and surrounding northeastern Indiana, has frequently drawn attention with right-wing social media comments. He stood by his post about Levine. “My tweet was a statement of fact,” Banks said in a statement. “Big Tech doesn’t have to agree with me, but they shouldn’t be able to cancel me.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Doctors accused of doing something dangerous or inappropriate could keep the allegations private until a regulatory board makes a final determination and issues a report under a state Supreme Court decision issued Friday. In its unanimous decision, the court said the Iowa Board of Medicine should not have publicly disclosed information about a doctor under investigation, as was standard for the agency. Its ruling likely will lead to changes in how dozens of other boards handle complaints. “Read in its entirety, we do not believe the statute is ambiguous. Investigative information cannot be released to the public prior to a final decision in a disciplinary proceeding,” Justice Edward Mansfield wrote. Iowa Freedom of Information Council Executive Director Randy Evans called the decision disappointing and said he hopes the Legislature revises the statute. “Those facts and circumstances need full and timely disclosure to patients and consumers so they can make an informed selection of a treating physician,” he said. The court ruled in the case of Dr. Domenico Calcaterra, a cardiothoracic surgeon who formerly practiced in Iowa City but now practices in another state. He has long denied allegations of disruptive behavior and unethical or unprofessional misconduct.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Overland Park Police Department plans to expand its team that responds to calls involving mental health crises, with a goal of defusing the situations while keeping everyone safe. The new Overland Park Crisis Action Team will have 12 members and six co-responders, though most of the positions haven’t started yet. Currently, it has two crisis intervention specialists and three co-responders, The Kansas City Star reports. When the team responds to a mental health call, it will be accompanied by a clinician from Johnson County Mental Health. A therapy dog will also join the team. “Our whole goal is to bring them in and let them do their job, and (officers are) there to make sure everybody’s safe,” said police Sgt. Stewart Brought. In September, the Overland Park City Council raised property taxes to create the expanded unit. OPCAT also received a nearly $250,000 grant from the Department of Justice. “This OPCAT unit, it will save lives,” said Sheila Albers, who has fought for police reforms since her 17-year-old son, John Albers, was killed by an Overland Park officer during a welfare check in January 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Striking workers at one of the world’s largest bourbon producers voted to ratify a new contract Saturday, a day after announcing a tentative agreement with Heaven Hill. About 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D went on strike about six weeks ago, forming picket lines at the company’s operations in Bardstown after rejecting a previous contract proposal. The tentative agreement came just days after the company signaled it intended to start hiring permanent replacement employees for bottling and warehouse operations. The workers then voted to ratify the five-year agreement Saturday, according to a statement from Heaven Hill. “We look forward to welcoming our team members as we transition back to normal operations,” company spokesperson Josh Hafer said in the statement. The dispute revolved around health care and scheduling, the latter a sign of the bourbon industry’s growing pains as it tries to keep up with global demand. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons. The spirits company’s other brands include Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The high school bands played, the costumed marching groups danced, and float riders threw Moon Pies and beads to the thousands of people who turned out Saturday for the city’s first big parade since the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic put the brakes on New Orleans’ signature brand of frivolity. The streets were lined with thousands of residents and tourists who came to watch the Krewe of Boo parade – the first float parade since Mardi Gras 2020. The Halloween-themed parade stretches from the city’s Marigny neighborhood through the French Quarter and into the Warehouse District. Riders on the floats dress up in Halloween-themed outfits and throw ghoulish and fun trinkets and beads to crowds that pack the streets. “This is one of the best feelings in a very long time,” said Jordan Philebar, a New Orleans resident who was dressed as Wednesday Addams from “The Addams Family” as she rode a float along with four members of her family. “It’s lovely to feel slightly normal again.” Mardi Gras 2020 was largely credited with contributing to the city becoming an early hot spot for the coronavirus. As the extent and seriousness of the pandemic became apparent, parades and music festivals were canceled.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed “right to food” constitutional amendment is on the ballot for the state’s voters in the Nov. 2 election. Some say it would simply put people in charge of how and what they eat, while others worry it would endanger animals and food supplies and turn urban neighborhoods into cattle pastures. For supporters, the language is short and to the point, ensuring the right to grow vegetables and raise livestock in an era when corporatization threatens local ownership of the food supply – a constitutional experiment that has never been tried in any state. For opponents and skeptics, it’s deceptively vague, representing a threat to food safety and animal welfare, and could embolden residents to raise cows in their backyards in cities like Portland and Bangor. Voters will be asked if they favor an amendment to the Maine Constitution “to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” The proposal is an outgrowth of the right-to-food movement, sometimes called the food sovereignty movement. Maine enacted the nation’s first food sovereignty law in 2017, allowing local governments to OK small food producers selling directly to customers on site. The law was especially popular with sellers of raw milk, which can be legally sold in Maine but is more restricted in many other states.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has disbarred retired Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly for withholding exculpatory evidence that surfaced in a 1981 double-murder case and lying about it over the years. The Baltimore Sun reports Cassilly learned of the court’s decision Friday in a phone call from the newspaper. “Oh, whatever. I’m retired anyway,” he reportedly told the Sun. The Maryland Court of Appeals found the former prosecutor lied about documents that undermined the credibility of an FBI agent on the case. The judges noted Cassilly, a Republican, served 36 years as Harford County’s top prosecutor and retired in 2019. The judges wrote that disbarring him would prevent his possible return to the courtroom and send a message. Cassilly maintains that he did nothing wrong but rather “fell into the whole anti-criminal justice movement, where the cops are the bad guys and the prosecutors are the bad guys.” “I’m disappointed, but the real answer is: Do I care? I don’t give a damn,” he said. “I wouldn’t do anything to engage in the practice of law right now because it’s such a screwed-up obscenity.” John Norman Huffington, who was released from prison in 2008 after serving 27 years of a life sentence, has said he would have won his freedom years earlier had Cassilly disclosed key records.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are considering whether to begin allowing electric bicycles in bike lanes. Currently, electric bikes are prohibited on bike paths because they’re categorized as mopeds, though advocates for bicyclists say the law is largely unenforced. The Boston Globe reports some state lawmakers are now pushing a bill to bring Massachusetts in line with 46 other states and Washington, D.C., in regulating electric bikes as bikes. “What’s abundantly clear, whatever the law, is people are riding e-bikes in bike lanes and bike paths, as they should – they are bikes,” said state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, D-Democrat, who is sponsoring the bill in the House. A similar bill is pending in the state Senate. The House chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, however, questioned whether it’s safe to allow bikes traveling at 20 mph or more on the paths. “These are pretty fast speeds,” said Rep. William Straus, D-Mattapoisett. “I want to be really cautious in terms of the safety issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nHamtramck: Another Michigan city is giving filters to residents as a result of high lead results in some drinking water samples. Hamtramck, in the Detroit area, is a 2-square-mile city with 28,000 residents, many of them immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and other countries. Seven hundred filters were passed out Thursday, and another 900 will be distributed this week, said City Manager Kathleen Angerer. “The water itself is fine. The issue is the outdated lead services lines that in some cases are leaching lead into the water into individual homes,” Mayor Karen Majewski said. She said not every home is affected. “People don’t need to panic,” Angerer said. LaTonya Hatcher, 49, was in line Thursday. “I want to get a filter for the sink,” she said. “I live in a newer neighborhood, and the pipes might be fine, but I was walking by and saw they were giving out filters, so I thought I should ask if I need one.” Across the state in Benton Harbor, residents have been urged to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking due to elevated lead levels. The problem in both communities, according to officials, is old lines that need to be replaced. Majewski said Hamtramck has replaced 260 lead lines over the past year but needs money to remove more.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Native Americans have contracted COVID-19 at two to three times the rate of white Minnesotans over the past month, according to state health officials. There are large pockets of unvaccinated people in the 18-to-49 age range in Minnesota’s tribal communities and across the country, according to Mary Owen, director of the Center for American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota medical school. “We have some folks who are not getting vaccinated, whether it’s because they’re resisting it or because they’re not able to get access. Not quite sure. It’s probably a combination of those. But that’s impacting us again, significantly,” said Owen, who is also president of the Association of American Indian Physicians. Owen said that’s especially concerning because Native Americans have high rates of health disparities, such as diabetes, that put them at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “We have some very frail people in our communities that cannot afford to get infected. We have to protect them,” Owen said. “So please, do what’s right for our communities, not just for us as individuals.” The Leech Lake reservation has recorded its highest numbers of positive COVID-19 cases over the past month since the pandemic began.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prison employees will conduct once-a-week rehearsals as the state prepares for its first execution since 2012, according to Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain. He said Friday that the rehearsals for a lethal injection are usually done once a month at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, following a protocol that’s about 20 pages long. “Very, very detailed,” Cain said. The Mississippi Supreme on Thursday set a Nov. 17 execution date for David Neal Cox, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to killing his wife, Kim, in 2010 in the northern Mississippi town of Shannon. Cox withdrew his appeals and once filed court papers calling himself “worthy of death.” Mississippi has not had an execution since 2012, and it had six that year. Cain confirmed Mississippi has obtained lethal injection drugs, but he declined to say how. “I’m not supposed to talk about the drugs too much,” Cain said. Mississippi is still facing a lawsuit filed in 2015 by the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center on behalf of two inmates. The suit argues Mississippi’s lethal injection protocol is inhumane.\n\nMissouri\n\nBates City: A small-town mayor resigned ahead of a scheduled impeachment hearing called after he was allegedly recorded uttering a racial slur. Shawn Fox offered his resignation last Monday to the Bates City Board of Aldermen, ahead of an impeachment hearing scheduled Wednesday, television station WDAF reports. Instead of the hearing, the board accepted Fox’s resignation Wednesday. Mayor Pro-Tem Roy Trussell said Fox’s resignation came after the city had concluded its investigation, which included a leaked recording of someone believed to be Fox uttering a racial slur, as well as allegations of sexual harassment. It was unclear when or where the recording was made or who had leaked it. Fox’s resignation was the latest in a recent exodus of city government officials amid mounting allegations of a hostile work environment. Alderman Donnie Hammond resigned Tuesday, and the city’s collector and a court clerk both recently stepped down. Bates City is a town of nearly 220 about 28 miles east of Kansas City.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation honored Chief Earl Old Person with a weeklong memorial, ending with a funeral service Friday in the Browning High School gym. The gym smelled of sage, many women wore ribbon skirts, and some men wore headdresses as they remembered the life of Old Person, who was the tribe’s chief for 43 years. He died of cancer Oct. 13 in Browning. He was 92. Hundreds of people gathered in the gym as Old Person was remembered for his tireless advocacy for Native Americans and their culture, his strength of character, and his humility. He served on the tribal council for more than 60 years and was chairman of the tribal business council for over 50 years. He traveled the world, meeting Queen Elizabeth, the shah of Iran, and every U.S. president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama in advocating for the Blackfeet Tribe. He also worked to preserve the Blackfeet language, songs and culture. But tribal members remember his constant presence on the reservation and his care and concern for the Blackfeet people. He would attend basketball games, community events and graduations. He served as a mentor and even a father figure to tribal members. “We’re putting one of our last chiefs to rest,” Jay St. Goddard said. “It’s not just a private event; it’s not just a Montana event – this is a national event.”\n\nNebraska\n\nSuperior: An employee who returned fire after a gunman killed two people at a grain elevator likely prevented more deaths, a Nebraska State Patrol official said Friday. The employee, who was not named, retrieved a weapon and shot Max Hoskinson, 61, after Hoskinson began shooting at the Agrex Elevator in Superior on Thursday. Hoskinson, of Superior, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities said he had been fired earlier Thursday and returned that afternoon with a gun and began shooting in an office area. The victims were identified as Sandra Nelson, 60, of Formoso, Kansas, and 53-year-old Darin Koepke, of Hadar, Nebraska. The third person shot by Hoskinson was treated at a hospital and released. Patrol Sgt. Jeff Roby said during the news conference that authorities do not anticipate filing any charges against the employee who shot Hoskinson. “In fact, it’s likely that the employee’s actions may have prevented much further loss of life in this tragedy,” Roby said. He said he could not comment on whether Hoskinson targeted the victims, who were all Agrex employees. He said several other employees were on site when the shooting occurred.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Lawmakers have decided motorists who want refunds of a $1-per-transaction surcharge that courts decided was unconstitutionally authorized in 2020 will have to go in person to state Department of Motor Vehicles offices. The Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee signed off Thursday on the refund program, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The move aims to comply with a Nevada Supreme Court ruling last May that said the surcharge was unconstitutionally authorized by the Legislature because the state constitution requires revenue measures to be approved by two-thirds majorities in both chambers. Senate Republicans opposed extending the DMV fee along with a tax on businesses in 2019 and filed suit after Democrats approved them. The DMV said it was collecting about $7 million per year from the fee but would provide refunds after the court ruling. The Review-Journal reports five other refund options were dismissed as more complex and costly than the amount collected, including mailing checks to all DMV customers. The rule that lawmakers adopted says people will have to present receipts in person at a DMV office for refunds. Business customers, with a larger volume of transactions, can receive checks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislative committee on Friday approved a proposal from the state Department of Health and Human Services to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The last-minute proposal from Gov. Chris Sununu and Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette came last week after she withdrew the requests for the acceptance of $27 million in federal COVID-19 vaccination funding that was rejected by the Executive Council the week prior. Approval for the $27 million was needed by both the council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which tabled the funds last month. Republican members expressed deep concern that accepting the funds would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19, including “quarantine and isolation.” Attorney General John Formella said that wasn’t the case. Sununu thanked the committee for its vote, saying that “we are committed to finding alternative sources of funds to ensure our vaccine distribution can move full steam ahead, and today’s vote allows us to do so.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Bucking a practice used by most law enforcement agencies in the state, the Newark Police Department, New Jersey’s largest municipal force, will stop posting the mug shots of people arrested for minor offenses. The city’s public safety department announced the change in a Facebook post Wednesday. The reason, public safety director Brian O’Hara said, is to help “safeguard individuals from marginalized communities from abuse.” In the post, O’Hara cited a spike in negative comments on a 2017 social media post regarding a prostitution arrest. “The incendiary comments fundamentally indicate that members of marginalized communities – including the transgender community – can become targets of cyber-bullying, which can lead to hate crimes and violence, simply because their photos were published online,” O’Hara said. After the spike in comments, he had the post taken down and changed the department’s policy on mug shots. From now on, the department will only publish mug shots that serve “a specific law enforcement purpose, such as locating a wanted or missing person.” Publishing mug shots can have detrimental consequences to people arrested, said Sarah E. Lageson, an associate professor at the Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice who has a doctorate in sociology.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal water managers warned Wednesday that like other basins across the western U.S., the Pecos River Basin is likely to experience growing water shortages as temperatures continue to rise over the next century. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation discussed the findings of a recently completed study on the basin during a virtual briefing, saying the goal of the work was to better understand the threats to water supplies in the region due to climate change. Officials also looked at what tools could be used to stretch resources to help sustain viable agriculture over the coming century as challenges grow. Reclamation Study Manager Dagmar Llewellyn said those challenges are significant. She described the Pecos basin as arid with a limited and highly variable water supply. “Drought and climate change-induced aridification is ongoing already in the basin,” she said. “We’ve been seeing less snowfall in the headwaters and more winter precipitation falling as rain. We’ve also been seeing higher consumption rates within the agricultural system.” The peak flow of snowmelt runoff into Santa Rosa Reservoir, located at the top of the system, amounted to only a trickle of about 5 cubic feet per second this year. Total volume during the runoff period was about 700 acre-feet, or 56 times less than the historical average. That meant less water for downstream users.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and two other U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill in the House on Friday to put immigrants who cleared debris after the Sept. 11 attacks on a fast track to legal immigration status in the United States. The 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act is a revised version of a bill that former Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York introduced in 2017 that did not advance in the House. Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley in a 2018 Democratic primary, winning the seat representing parts of the Bronx and Queens. Immigrants in New York, many of whom are Spanish-speaking cleanup workers, have long asked to obtain legal immigration status in the U.S. as compensation for their work and the subsequent health problems they suffered after the attacks. Hired informally by cleaning companies, the workers cleared debris, asbestos and dust inside lower Manhattan buildings for months without adequate protective gear. But 20 years after 9/11, only several dozen are still participating in protests and making the request, while others have abandoned that fight. Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Rep. Grace Meng, both from New York, are lead co-sponsors of the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The soon-to-be successor to a state House member who died this month said Friday that he was outside the U.S. Capitol in January as an insurrection occurred. Donnie Loftis, who was chosen by Gaston County Republican activists last week to succeed the late Rep. Dana Bumgardner, confirmed his attendance at the Jan. 6 event to WRAL-TV. Loftis, a former Gaston County commissioner, said his involvement in what turned into a riot was strictly peaceful. On Jan. 6, “while I peacefully exercised my first amendment rights in front of the US Capitol, I was surprised and disappointed to watch others storm the entrance as violence ensued,” he wrote by text message to the station. “I had absolutely zero involvement in the rioting and categorically condemn the storming of our Capitol building that day.” Hundreds of Donald Trump’s supporters battered their way past police, injured dozens of officers and interrupted the electoral count inside the Capitol certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. In January, Loftis had posted a picture of himself to Facebook before the rally saying he was on a bus headed to Washington, according to WRAL. “I got gassed three times and was at the entrance when they breached the door,” Loftis, an Army veteran, posted at the time, according to a screenshot. “I spoke to many service members, and we all agreed that we didn’t want to be there, but we had no other choice. They don’t get it that they work for us. And I mean that in a respectful way.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is working to extend its contract with Hollywood actor Josh Duhamel to promote tourism in his home state. The top tourism official in one of the least-visited states in the nation said the 48-year-old star of several “Transformers” movies has been effective in attracting visitors to North Dakota, better known for its brutal cold weather than as a vacation destination. “He has helped expand our image and awareness of our state,” said Sara Otte Coleman, who heads the state’s tourism agency. Duhamel, a native of Minot, has been the face of North Dakota and its pitchman since 2013. He has been paid more than $1 million from the state since then. “He’s a great ambassador for our state and cares about where he comes from,” Otte Coleman said. Duhamel was the honorary chairman of a fund that raised millions of dollars for victims of a 2011 flood in his hometown that swamped more than 4,000 homes and businesses. About 11,000 people were forced to evacuate. The home where Duhamel grew up and his sister’s family’s home were both severely damaged. He appealed to his fans on social media and on TV appearances to help the victims of the flood. His current two-year tourism deal expires in December. Otte Coleman said she expects Duhamel to sign an extension.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s debut of its new license plate failed to take off because a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer. The new license plate illustrates rays of sunlight beaming into the sky, with a banner that reads “Birthplace of Aviation” draped across the horizon. But the banner, which should have been trailing behind the plane, was attached to its front. After the unveiling, Ohio officials said in a statement that they were aware of the mishap and that it would be corrected to show the banner trailing the plane before Ohioans upgrade their plates. Ohio isn’t the only entity to make this flighty error. The front of the Wright Flyer can easily be mistaken for its back because the plane’s propellers were located at the back, instead of the front. The plates are expected to land on the market Dec. 29.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye unexpectedly resigned from the post Friday, effective immediately, the state health department said. Department spokesperson Rachel Klein said Frye “felt it was time to move on” from leading the agency. His departure came a day after state Republican leaders, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, expressed outrage upon learning the health department in May issued a birth certificate with a nonbinary gender designation. The birth certificate was issued as part of a settlement with an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident. The settlement was reached under the administration of former state Attorney General Mike Hunter, Frye said. In a statement released by the department Friday, Frye lauded “the dedication, resilience and tenacity of the OSDH team.” “They have worked tirelessly over the last two years to ensure Oklahomans had access to not only COVID-19 testing, vaccinations and critical information, but to other life-saving services,” he said in the statement. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed has been named interim commissioner of health, according to Kevin Corbett, state Secretary of Health and Mental Health.\n\nOregon\n\nThe Dalles: The massive Google data centers on the edge of this Columbia River town are triggering concerns about water usage. Now a critical part of modern computing, data centers help people stream movies, conduct transactions, post updates on social media, store trillions of photos and more. But a single facility can also churn through millions of gallons of water per day to keep hot-running equipment cool. Google wants to build at least two more data centers in The Dalles, worrying some residents who fear there eventually won’t be enough water for everyone – including for area farms and fruit orchards, which are by far the biggest users. The Dalles is the seat of Wasco County, which is suffering extreme and exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The region last summer endured its hottest days on record, reaching 118 degrees Fahrenheit in The Dalles. The new data centers wouldn’t be able to use Columbia River water and instead would take it from rivers and groundwater that has gone through the city’s water treatment plant. However, the snowpack in the nearby Cascade Range that feeds the aquifers varies wildly year-to-year, and glaciers are melting. Adding to the unease: The 15,000 town residents don’t know how much water the proposed data centers will use because Google calls it a trade secret.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The School District of Philadelphia is working to repatriate Native American skeletal remains found in a high school classroom closet this summer. A letter sent to parents of Central High School students Friday said the “human skeletal item” was previously used as a teaching aid and dated back to the 1850s. The district consulted with the Department of Interior, Temple University and other experts about how to handle the remains, Evelyn Nunez, the district’s chief of schools, wrote in the letter to parents. “The District is also working with these partners to return this person, who has been identified as a male Native American, to his home tribe,” she said. Central High School, founded in 1836, is the second-oldest continuously operating public high school in the country, but it is not alone in its history of using skeletal remains as learning tools. In a statement Friday, the district said the remains were likely used in teaching through the mid-1900s at the latest, but the district’s schools have not used skeletal remains in classrooms for more than a decade. The district has launched a search of inventories at all of its schools to make sure any other skeletal remains are identified, treated with respect and also repatriated if possible.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Legislature has created a website to post the proposals it’s receiving for spending federal funds to help the state recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Rhode Island was allocated $1.1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee is urging the Legislature to start spending, saying Rhode Island is the only state in the Northeast that has not used any of its federal pandemic relief funding yet. The General Assembly created a section on its website for residents to see all of the ideas that are being suggested. The goal is to increase transparency. “With such a large infusion of federal funding, it is critical that the process of allocating these funds is done in a transparent manner that allows the public to access the information being shared with legislators,” House Speaker Joe Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “We encourage the public to be engaged so we use this money to its maximum benefit for Rhode Islanders.” Submitting a recommendation to the portal should not be viewed as a formal request for funding, and it does not guarantee a response, public hearing or appropriation from the General Assembly, the Legislature said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: A widow is suing Charleston County two years after her husband died following a ketamine injection he received during an arrest. The complaint filed by Tabitha Eileen Britt earlier this month says the two paramedics who injected her husband, James Britt, with the sedative drug after he was handcuffed by Mount Pleasant police in 2019 weren’t authorized to do so under state law. The Post and Courier reports Tabitha Britt wants a judge to stop county paramedics from using ketamine to aid law enforcement without a medical reason. A police report says Mount Pleasant officers were dispatched Sept. 30, 2019, for a man urinating on the roadway. According to the lawsuit, one officer initially stopped to help James Britt change a car tire before she said she would arrest him for public intoxication. According to the complaint, police forced James Britt to the ground in a prone position, where he repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. One paramedic who arrived at the scene then injected James Britt with 500 mg of ketamine, the maximum dose under county guidelines. The suit says James Britt stopped breathing minutes later; although he was resuscitated in the ambulance, he never regained consciousness and died less than three weeks later in the hospital.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: A study that focuses on ways to cool streams during the hottest times of the year in an effort to preserve the trout population is yielding positive results, officials from the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks say. Jeremy Kientz, a fisheries biologist with the agency, has been working to discover ways to cool the waters, in a study that specifically focuses on French Creek in Custer State Park. He said it’s one of a few trout streams in the Black Hills that can reach temperatures up to 80 degrees for several hours a day, increasing the chances of trout mortality. “We’ve had a couple instances here in the Black Hills where we’ve had trout fish kills because of temperatures that are too high in the summertime,” Kientz said. “When the water temperature hits 80 degrees, and it stays there for a little while, the trout will die. Even at 75 degrees, trout shut down, and they don’t eat. So now you not only have a survival issue but a growth issue.” But working on ways to cool the streams is not easy, Kientz said. Building shade takes time, and dams have become unpopular, not to mention expensive. So Kientz said he has been working with mechanical engineers from North Dakota State University to build small pockets of cooled water where trout can seek refuge when temperatures rise, the Black Hills Pioneer reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An area school district can continue requiring students to wear masks in school after a federal judge on Friday extended a ruling blocking an opt-out provision. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by the families of two children with disabilities who attend Williamson County schools. They claim Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates puts their children at risk and violates their educational rights. In the Friday opinion, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found that “disabled students are at a significantly higher risk for severe infection and are exposed at a higher rate following” following Lee’s executive order. He called that “an irreparable harm” that justifies continuing to block the order. “The record before the Court establishes that temporary universal mask mandates adopted by the Williamson County and Franklin school systems have been, and likely would continue to be, effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19,” Crenshaw wrote. “Executive Order No. 84 violates federal law and must yield.” The ruling mirrors those by federal judges in Memphis and Knoxville, where Lee’s order is also blocked. As a result, school districts in Shelby, Williamson and Knox counties can continue to enforce universal mask policies.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the state law that bans most abortions to remain in place but has agreed to hear arguments in the case in early November. The justices said Friday that they will decide whether the Justice Department and abortion providers can sue in federal court over a law that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said was “enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas.” Answering that question will help determine whether the law should be blocked while legal challenges continue. The court is moving at an unusually fast pace that suggests it plans to make a decision quickly. Arguments are set for Nov. 1. The court’s action leaves in place for the time being a law that clinics say has led to an 80% reduction in abortions in the nation’s second-largest state. The justices said in their order that they were deferring action on a request from the Justice Department to put the law on hold. Sotomayor wrote that she would have blocked the law now. “The promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care, who are entitled to relief now,” Sotomayor wrote. It takes just four justices to decide to hear a case.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A federal civil rights investigation released Thursday found widespread racial harassment of Black and Asian American students at a school district, including hundreds of documented uses of the N-word and other racial epithets over the past five years. The probe also found physical assaults, derogatory racial comments and harsher discipline for students of color at Davis School District, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. The district has agreed to take several steps as part of a settlement agreement, including a new department to handle complaints, more training and data collection. Black students throughout the district told investigators about similar experiences of white and non-Black students calling them the N-word, referring to them as monkeys or apes, and saying their skin was dirty or looked like feces, according to the department’s findings. Students also made monkey noises at their Black peers, repeatedly referenced slavery and lynching, and told Black students to “go pick cotton,” and “you are my slave.” The investigation found Black students were also disciplined more harshly than their white peers for similar behavior and were denied the ability to form student groups while supporting similar requests by other students.\n\nVermont\n\nGuilford: The state has erected a historical marker recognizing the life of Lucy Terry Prince, an African American poet who wrote what is thought to be the oldest known poem by an African American. The marker was unveiled this week at the Interstate 91 welcome center in Guilford. Prince and her husband lived in Guilford in the late 1700s. As a child, Lucy Terry was stolen from Africa and enslaved in Deerfield, Massachusetts, the marker says. Her poem “Bars Fight” tells the story of the 1746 attack on Deerfield settlers.

Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras announced the change Wednesday, noting the stress schools employees are under, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. “Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve heard directly from dozens of teachers, principals, and support staff about how stressful this year has been,” Kamras said in a letter. “Many have shared that they’re on the brink of burning out – even leaving – and it’s only October.” Richmond schools were already set to be closed three days that week, for Election Day, Diwali and parent-teacher conferences. Kamras also announced changes to address three major stressors: doing too much, not enough time, and students “exhibiting significant trauma from the past 20 months.” There will be no new programs, initiatives or curricula, and the system is adding 100 lunch monitors to help free up teachers at lunch time, Kamras said. He also authorized principles to make changes needed to “hold independent teacher planning time more sacred.” Kamras said he aims to reallocate $3 million of federal relief funding to boost student mental health support.\n\nWashington\n\nPort Angeles: About 40 shipping containers tumbled into the Pacific Ocean in rough seas west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca entrance Friday, authorities said. The ship then caught fire Saturday as a result of powdered chemicals that had been spilled, The Seattle Times reports. The U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Northwest said on Twitter on Friday afternoon that the ship lost the containers when it listed to its side. A Coast Guard helicopter from Port Angeles was sent to the area, and the crew was monitoring 35 floating containers as they moved north. The ship was headed to Canada when the incident happened, officials said. Photos from the helicopter captured containers, with one group of three linked together, floating in the water, a Coast Guard Twitter post showed. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is located northwest of Seattle. “The ship is on fire and expelling toxic gas,” a navigation warning sent to area ships said, according to the Times. “Two fallen containers are floating in the vicinity of the vessel.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Top state officials on Friday said they would welcome three Maryland counties that inquired about becoming part of the Mountain State, even though the likelihood of the union is almost nonexistent. “We’re absolutely standing here with open arms,” West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said during a news conference that included state Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who also offered their support. Justice offered to call state lawmakers back for a special session to vote on a resolution that would add about 250,000 people in Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties in Maryland to West Virginia. Maryland officials representing the counties wrote letters dated Oct. 14 to Blair and Hanshaw expressing interest in joining West Virginia, news outlets report. The letters were signed by Maryland state Sen. George Edwards and Dels. Wendell Beitzel, Jason Buckel, Mike McKay and William Wivell. “The western areas of the state feel they’re being shortchanged in a lot of respects, and we had a lot of constituents approaching us … saying, ‘Why can’t we just join West Virginia?’ It’s just that simple,” Beitzel told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Friday halted the state’s fall wolf season two weeks before hunters were set to take to the woods, siding with wildlife advocacy groups who argued that holding the hunt would be unconstitutional. Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost issued a temporary injunction halting the season, which was set to begin Nov. 6. The order comes as part of a lawsuit that a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups filed in August seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate a state law authorizing annual seasons. Among other things, the coalition argued that the season is illegal because the Department of Natural Resources hasn’t updated its regulations setting up season parameters and has been relying on an emergency rule put in place shortly after then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a law in 2012 authorizing annual seasons and a wolf management plan that hasn’t been updated since 2007. Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional on its face, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it. The law gives the DNR great leeway in setting kill limits, hunting zone hours and the number of licenses, making it all the more important that the agency follow the regulatory process to ensure it doesn’t violate the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: COVID-19 has hospitalized more residents than at any point in the COVID-19 pandemic, with one public health officer saying the situation is “like a war zone” at one of the state’s biggest hospitals. Wyoming hospitals had 249 COVID-19 patients Thursday, topping the previous high of 247 in November. The vast majority weren’t vaccinated. Unvaccinated people have accounted for 98% of all new cases in Wyoming since May 1, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming’s surge coincides with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., currently about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower for COVID-19 inoculation. The strain on Wyoming hospitals, meanwhile, has been more prolonged than previously. Last fall and winter, hospitalizations stayed above 200 for about three weeks. This year, they have hovered around 200 since early September. Wyoming Medical Center in Casper has been treating about 30% of Wyoming’s COVID-19 patients but lately has been denying transfer requests. “It’s like a war zone,” the Casper area’s health officer, Dr. Mark Dowell, told a county health board Thursday. “The ICU is overrun, and there are a lot of patients being admitted.” Five Wyoming hospitals have at some point gone into crisis standards of care during the current surge.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/25"}]}

Here's ...", "text": "Good news for drivers: gas prices are easing up.\n\nThe national average for regular fuel at the pump was $3.37 per gallon as of Friday, down about 13 cents from last month and nearly 50 cents from a year ago, according to data from AAA. Barring any unexpected road bumps ahead, experts expect prices should keep falling through the remainder of the year.\n\n“If you're going to go somewhere, it's a great weekend to go because prices are going in the right direction,” said AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross. \"They've been falling almost a penny a day now.\"\n\nKentucky sees lower gas prices ahead of Labor Day Weekend\n\nThe average gas prices in Kentucky have dropped over the past month — following the national trend, according to data from AAA.\n\nThe current average for regular fuel in Kentucky is about $3 per gallon, where a month ago it was about $3.30 per gallon. In Louisville, the current average is about $3.24 per gallon, a drop from the $3.66 average a month ago in the city.\n\nWhy are gas prices down?\n\nFor most of the summer, the national average price for regular gasoline could “barely break away” from $3.50 per gallon, according to Gross. Data from AAA shows prices hovering between $3.44 and $3.54 in June and July.\n\n“Now, all of a sudden, it’s just tipped,” Gross said, adding prices haven’t been this low since March.\n\nConsumers have lower oil prices to thank.\n\n“As we've seen oil prices drop in the last month or so, you're seeing prices at the pump play catch-up with that,” said Matt Smith, an oil analyst with commodity data firm Kpler.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, is down more than 10% from early July. Weakening oil demand in China ‒ a top oil consumer ‒ amid a slowing economy has helped tamp down oil prices, as well as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, Smith said.\n\nWill gas prices keep falling?\n\nWhile prices at the pump are improving, there are a number of circumstances that could reverse the trend.\n\nHurricane season has been relatively quiet this year, but the season isn't over until Nov. 30. And experts say there’s always the chance of geopolitical tensions heating up and causing oil prices to climb.\n\nBut barring a major hurricane that hits U.S. oil refineries or a “global catastrophe,” Gross said prices at the pump should “keep dropping steadily” through the end of the year. Especially as refineries start to shift away from summer blend gasoline toward cheaper winter blends in September.\n\n“Looking forward, I think consumers can expect more of the same. So, we will see prices easing a little lower from here,” Smith said.

What to ...", "text": "The price of a getaway this Memorial Day weekend may be a headache at the airport or on the highway as the hectic summer travel season kicks off.\n\nAs travelers set out for a brief vacation over Memorial Day weekend before heading home, it’s likely that jams will hold up highway traffic and clog airport security lines over the coming days.\n\nAAA predicts that this Memorial Day weekend may be the busiest in terms of holiday travel in nearly 20 years. Amid this summer’s potentially record-breaking travel season, here’s how to speed up your commute this Memorial Day weekend.\n\nHow many Americans will travel for Memorial Day?\n\nAAA anticipates that from Thursday to Monday (Memorial Day), 43.8 million Americans will be traveling at least 50 miles away from home. Road trips seem to be especially popular, with AAA projecting that nearly 9 in 10 of these Americans will travel by car, the highest number of Memorial Day weekend road trippers since AAA started tracking these numbers in 2000.\n\nWhile the association projects that more than 38 million Americans will be traveling by car, airports won’t be immune to jams either.\n\nIn fact, the Transportation Security Administration is preparing for more than 18 million people to pass through airport security checkpoints from Thursday to Wednesday, May 29.\n\n“We haven’t seen Memorial Day weekend travel numbers like these in almost 20 years,” said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel, in a press release. “We’re projecting an additional 1 million travelers this holiday weekend compared to 2019, which not only means we’re exceeding pre-pandemic levels but also signals a very busy summer travel season ahead.”\n\nThe travel headache over Memorial Day weekend may be only the start of a potentially record-breaking summer travel season, as U.S. airlines are projecting that 271 million passengers will fly from June 1 to Aug. 31, up from last summer’s record of 255 million travelers. In fact, the TSA has forecasted that it will see the highest volumes of travelers passing through airport security checkpoints ever this summer travel season.\n\nWhat is the busiest travel day for Memorial Day weekend?\n\nAs Americans have widely reported in polls that they are concerned about the country’s economy, road tripping has emerged as a popular method of travel this Memorial Day weekend due to its flexibility and convenience, according to AAA.\n\nBob Pishue, a transportation analyst at the traffic management company INRIX, predicted that travel times for drivers would be up to 90% longer than they typically are. Sunday, May 27 and Memorial Day itself were expected to be especially busy, as trips back home would peak then, according to INRIX.\n\nFor those picking up rental cars, rental car company Hertz expected that Thursday and Friday, May 24 would be the busiest days.\n\nIn terms of air travel, the TSA anticipated that Friday, May 24 would rank as the busiest travel day for the entire Memorial Day weekend, with nearly 3 million people passing through airport security checkpoints on that day alone.\n\n“In close coordination with airport, airline and travel partners, we are more than ready to handle this summer’s increased travel volumes,” David Pekoske, a TSA administrator, said in a press release. “We are also continuing to deploy state-of-the-art checkpoint technology that increases security effectiveness, efficiency and enhances the passenger experience, and our retention and recruitment numbers are the highest they’ve ever been.”\n\nWhen is the best time to travel on Memorial Day weekend?\n\nFor the millions predicted to hit the road for a weekend getaway in the coming days, INRIX advised that drivers setting out on Thursday or Friday get on the road early to avoid running into traffic from other travelers. In addition, the company said that drivers heading home on Sunday, May 26 or on Memorial Day should avoid traveling during the afternoon, as trips home would peak then.\n\nAAA predicted that these would be the best times for drivers to travel over Memorial Day weekend:\n\nThursday: Before 11 a.m. and after 7 p.m.\n\nFriday, May 24: Before 11 a.m. and after 8 p.m.\n\nSaturday, May 25: Before 1 p.m. and after 6 p.m.\n\nSunday, May 26: Before 1 p.m.\n\nMemorial Day: After 7 p.m.\n\nWhat time is heaviest traffic on Memorial Day weekend?\n\nAAA projected that these times would be the busiest for drivers:\n\nThursday: Noon to 6 p.m.\n\nFriday, May 24: Noon to 7 p.m.\n\nSaturday, May 25: 2-5 p.m.\n\nSunday, May 26: 3-7 p.m.\n\nMemorial Day: 3-7 p.m.\n\nTips for speeding up travel time on Memorial Day weekend\n\nWith weekend highway closures for maintenance, like the unpopular closures of portions of Interstate 17 last weekend and Mother’s Day weekend that led to hours-long traffic jams, drivers should carefully plan their trips in accordance with highway conditions. Pishue advised that drivers avoid being stuck in traffic by doing the following:\n\nChecking services like az511.com, which shows Arizona highway conditions in real-time\n\nStaying up to date on traffic through local news outlets. The Republic publishes a list of Valley freeway closures for the weekend using data from the Arizona Department of Transportation that drivers can consult to plan their commutes.\n\nLooking at traffic apps, like Waze, which displays a live traffic map. Chandler became the first Arizona city to share traffic information through Waze, meaning that users can view the locations of street closures, construction sites and maintenance projects in Chandler based on official information from the city itself.\n\nWhile the TSA said that it’s prepared to deal with the influx of passengers that will be flooding airports nationwide this Memorial Day weekend, the administration and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport advised air travelers to follow these tips to keep from holding up lines through airport security checkpoints:\n\nAllow extra time to travel to the airport and get through security checkpoints amid the busy holiday travel season. The TSA advised that passengers factor in extra time for all the activities they may need to do before getting to their gates — from parking to returning rental cars to taking shuttles to the airport to checking in with their airlines to going through security. Check current wait times at Sky Harbor’s security checkpoints at skyharbor.com or at the flight information screens throughout the airport.\n\nReserve parking at Sky Harbor beforehand at the airport’s parking website.\n\nReview the status of flights in advance through airline websites or skyharbor.com before arriving at Sky Harbor for a flight, picking up travelers or dropping off passengers.\n\nMake a free reservation in Sky Harbor’s PHX RESERVE program to save a spot in the TSA security checkpoint lines in Terminal Three and Terminal Four. Travelers are able to make reservations and walk-in appointments through PHX RESERVE from 4-11 a.m. at Terminal Three if they’re flying out any time from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. In Terminal Four, passengers are eligible for PHX RESERVE from 5:30-11 a.m. as long as their flight is scheduled from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Because availability for walk-in appointments is limited, reservations, which travelers can make up to six days before their flight, are advised.\n\nBegin packing for the airport with an empty bag. The TSA said that travelers who empty their bags before packing them are less likely to be stopped by airport security due to having prohibited items. The administration advised that passengers consult TSA guidelines to learn what they can — and can’t — bring on flights. Travelers heading to the beach for Memorial Day weekend must pack sunscreen in containers that are larger than 3.4 ounces in check-in bags.\n\nHow much will gas prices be on Memorial Day weekend?\n\nAAA projected that this Memorial Day weekend, pump prices will be similar to last year’s, when gas nationwide cost about $3.57 on average. While gas prices increased over the spring, the association said they’ve been relatively steady in the last few weeks.\n\nAAA reported on Thursday that the national average price for a gallon of gas wavered only slightly as compared with the price a week before until it increased by a penny to $3.61, a nickel less than a month ago but 7 cents more than a year before. In Arizona, the average gas price on Thursday was over a quarter higher at about $3.88, which was still nearly a quarter less than it was a month ago and over 70 cents less than it was a year ago.\n\nThe lack of movement in pump prices in the days before Memorial Day was typical of the time, according to the association.\n\nHowever, that may change as the summer driving season begins, which may cause gas prices to creep up. The business of Memorial Day weekend may also drive pump prices up — at least temporarily — AAA wrote.\n\n“Since the pandemic, the summer driving season has not seen a surge in demand, which can push pump prices higher,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said. “So it will be interesting to see if this year bucks that trend.”\n\nGeopolitical factors, like conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may also lead to changes in pump prices, as they could shock the oil market. In addition, Gross said that while the Biden administration’s decision to sell almost 1 million barrels of gas in northeastern states, which was announced Tuesday, may keep regional gas prices from surging, the national average pump price probably will not change much.\n\nDo flight prices go up on Memorial Day weekend?\n\nEven though this Memorial Day weekend is slated to be the busiest for airports in nearly 20 years, AAA found that plane ticket prices for this weekend were comparable to last year’s. Domestic flight ticket prices increased by up to 2%, according. Popular American destinations included Miami beaches, Seattle cruise ports, New York and Las Vegas while European cities like Rome, London and Paris dominated the list of frequently booked international spots, according to AAA booking data.\n\nThe association wrote that numerous factors determine plane ticket prices for passengers, including where they’re flying, how many stops they’re making and the fare class they choose. As a result, travelers who book a nonstop flight, seat selection and an included carry-on will probably pay more than passengers who opt for basic economy and a layover flight.\n\nWhy will Memorial Day weekend be so busy?\n\nLower travel prices may be behind the busyness predicted to hit airports and highways this Memorial Day weekend. Airfare decreased by 6% and hotel rates fell by 0.4% as compared with prices from a year before, according to data released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In addition, the cost of renting a car or truck has decreased by 10%.\n\nFor road trippers, however, the national average price of gas is still over a nickel higher than a year ago.\n\nWhat is the weather like on Memorial Day weekend?\n\nIt’s expected that triple-digit weather will make its return in the Valley over Memorial Day weekend, meaning that Phoenicians are slated to see some of the highest temperatures all year so far over the holiday weekend.\n\nThe triple-digit weather is predicted to continue over the weekend into much of next week and perhaps longer, signaling a hot and dry June. While temperatures will fall from a 98-degree high on Friday, May 24 to a high of 91 degrees on Saturday, May 25, they’ll climb to a 102-degree high on Memorial Day. By Wednesday, May 30, temperatures are slated to creep up to a high of 105 degrees.\n\nWhat about fire risk?\n\nRestrictions are in place for most of the Tonto National Forest as well as state trust lands in three counties.\n\nThat means no fireworks, no fires outside of grills, no target shooting and limitations on where people enjoying the great outdoors can go to grab a smoke.\n\nThe restrictions are the lowest level of limitations on public lands.\n\nThe Tonto Forest restrictions kicked in Thursday and will remain in place through Sept. 30. The areas immediately in and around Globe and Payson are exempt.\n\nState trust land requires users to get a permit before accessing the land for hiking or other purposes. Restrictions are in place for these lands in Gila, Maricopa and Pinal counties.\n\nMadeline Nguyen is a breaking news reporter for The Republic.

That 47.7 million mark would represent almost a full return to pre-pandemic levels for Fourth of July travel, and the second-highest Independence Day travel volume on record after 2019, according to AAA.\n\nFourth of July: Where to see fireworks in Hudson Valley\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nDining: Where to eat, drink outdoors in Dutchess County\n\nSummer: What to see, where to go in the Hudson Valley\n\nAAA warns traffic congestion may begin Thursday afternoon, as people try to get a jump on the long weekend. There is not expected to be respite from the congestion until July 6; many companies are observing the holiday on Monday, allowing for travelers to return from their trips after Independence Day.\n\nMetro-North Railroad is altering its schedule slightly. But it will have a regular Sunday schedule for those visiting the New York City to see fireworks. Both plane and train travel is rebounding after taking a hit in ridership during the pandemic.\n\n\"Travel is in full swing this summer, as Americans eagerly pursue travel opportunities they've deferred for the last year and a half,\" said Lloyd Albert, senior vice president of public and government affairs for AAA Northeast.\n\nHere's what else to know about holiday travel:\n\nGas prices climbing\n\nWhile all modes of travel will see a spike this year, automobile trips will be the dominant one, with 43.6 million Americans, or 91% of holiday weekend travelers, reaching their destinations by car. And that is despite a rise in gas prices.\n\nAccording to GasBuddy, a group that looks for ways for North American drivers to save money on fuel, current gas prices are about 43% higher than they were last year.\n\nWhile the nation was gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic at this time last year, gas was selling for an average of $2.18 a gallon. New York drivers currently are paying an average price of $3.15 per gallon.\n\nBut even locally, the price you pay could be more or less than that, depending on what county you are in.\n\nAccording to AAA, as of Wednesday drivers around the Hudson Valley were paying:\n\n$3.27 per gallon on average in Westchester\n\n$3.26 in Rockland\n\n$3.18 in Putnam\n\n$3.16 in Dutchess\n\n$3.10 in Orange\n\n$3.09 in Ulster\n\n$3.08 in Sullivan\n\nHeading outside the region?\n\nDepending on where you travel, you could see even more extreme highs and lows for gas prices. Mississippi and Louisiana currently have the lowest average price per gallon: $2.74 in the former and $2.75 in the latter, according to AAA.\n\nThe highest average gas prices right now are on the West Coast and beyond: $4.28 a gallon in California, and $4 a gallon in Hawaii. And, said Fran Mayo, AAA Northeast spokeswoman, those average prices could increase by another nickel as we go into the weekend.\n\nThese are also the highest prices seen on a Fourth of July weekend since 2014, Gas Buddy and AAA said. Back then, the average price was $3.66 per gallon.\n\nAnd with much of the nation continuing to recover from the pandemic this summer, and more road trips keeping demand for gas high, Gas Buddy predicts that prices will remain above $3 a gallon through Labor Day.\n\nOne more thing before hitting the road: AAA Northeast reminds drivers to pack an emergency roadside kit, and to make sure their car is ready for the long trip ahead to avoid a breakdown along the way. AAA expects to rescue more than 460,000 of its members on the roadside this weekend.\n\nWhat about trains and planes?\n\nFor those locally depending on the trains, Metro-North Railroad will have some adjustments.\n\nFriday's schedule will follow the current weekday schedule, but with more cars added to select trains during the evening outbound rush.\n\nSaturday will follow a regular Saturday schedule, but Sunday and Monday trains will both follow a Sunday schedule.\n\nAs for other means of travel, 3.5 million are expected to fly this weekend, which would be about 90% of the pre-pandemic level, according to AAA.\n\nAnother 620,000 will use buses, trains, and even cruises, which are just beginning to come back. That's up 72% from last year, but still 83% below 2019.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/23/gas-prices-down/74908251007/", "title": "Gas prices are down. But how long will it last?", "text": "Good news for drivers: gas prices are easing up.\n\nThe national average for regular fuel at the pump was $3.37 per gallon as of Friday, down about 13 cents from last month and nearly 50 cents from a year ago, according to data from AAA. Barring any unexpected road bumps ahead, experts expect prices should keep falling through the remainder of the year.\n\n“If you're going to go somewhere, it's a great weekend to go because prices are going in the right direction,” said AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross. \"They've been falling almost a penny a day now.\"\n\nWhy are gas prices down?\n\nFor most of the summer, the national average price for regular gasoline could “barely break away” from $3.50 per gallon, according to Gross. Data from AAA shows prices hovering between $3.44 and $3.54 in June and July.\n\n“Now, all of a sudden, it’s just tipped,” Gross said, adding prices haven’t been this low since March.\n\nConsumers have lower oil prices to thank.\n\n“As we've seen oil prices drop in the last month or so, you're seeing prices at the pump play catch-up with that,” said Matt Smith, an oil analyst with commodity data firm Kpler.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, is down more than 10% from early July. Weakening oil demand in China ‒ a top oil consumer ‒ amid a slowing economy has helped tamp down oil prices, as well as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, Smith said.\n\nFlying for Labor Day weekend 2024?TSA predicts record-breaking numbers at security\n\nWill gas prices keep falling?\n\nWhile prices at the pump are improving, there are a number of circumstances that could reverse the trend.\n\nHurricane season has been relatively quiet this year, but the season isn't over until Nov. 30. And experts say there’s always the chance of geopolitical tensions heating up and causing oil prices to climb.\n\nBut barring a major hurricane that hits U.S. oil refineries or a “global catastrophe,” Gross said prices at the pump should “keep dropping steadily” through the end of the year. Especially as refineries start to shift away from summer blend gasoline toward cheaper winter blends in September.\n\n“Looking forward, I think consumers can expect more of the same. So, we will see prices easing a little lower from here,” Smith said. While he’s not confident prices will dip below the $3 per gallon benchmark this year, the trends are “a good thing for our pocketbooks.”\n\nWhere are gas prices cheapest?\n\nAccording to AAA data, states with the cheapest gas prices per gallon as of Friday include:\n\nMississippi: $2.92\n\nOklahoma: $2.94\n\nTennessee: $2.96\n\nTexas: $2.97\n\nSouth Carolina: $3.00\n\nMeanwhile, some states are still selling above $3.50 per gallon on average.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/23"}]}

John Carney proposed putting $50 million toward building a new school in Wilmington’s East Side. The school would replace Bancroft School in Christina School District.\n\nCarney’s proposal includes funding for major renovations to Stubbs Early Education Center and Bayard School, the two other Christina facilities in Wilmington.\n\nThe money would be appropriated through the state Bond Bill, and still needs to be approved by both the Joint Finance Committee and full General Assembly.\n\nFor the state to be successful, Wilmington needs to be successful, Carney said during a press conference Wednesday morning at Stubbs. For Wilmington to be successful, the focus needs to be on education, he said.\n\n“It’s not just about a building, but it starts with a building,” Carney said. “A place that parents and children and neighbors can be proud of.”\n\nUnlike most school construction projects, the proposed replacement for Bancroft would be fully funded by the state.\n\nNormally, to build a new school, districts need approval from the Department of Education to receive the state portion of funding. In recent years, the department has stretched its limited construction budget by only approving funding for districts facing drastic growth or with buildings that are over-capacity.\n\nAfter getting state approval, a district must pass a capital referendum in order to shore up the local share of the funding — often about 20 percent.\n\nWilmington schools aren't seeing as much growth as their downstate counterparts, making it difficult to do major renovations or construction on aging schools.\n\nRep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha, D-Wilmington, said he wasn't sure when the newest school was built in Wilmington, but it had to have been at least 50 years ago.\n\n\"That's 50 years of not meeting their needs based on today's standards,\" he said.\n\nIf Carney’s proposal moves through the General Assembly, this would be the latest round of extra funding the state has pumped into Christina School District.\n\nSTATEWIDE SCHOOL FUNDING:Gov. John Carney proposes expanding Opportunity Funding to $75 million\n\nBayard, Bancroft and Stubbs all received funding as part of Gov. Jack Markell’s Priority Schools initiative in 2014, an effort to provide the state’s lowest-performing schools with extra funding and support.\n\nThe plan targeted Wilmington’s six lowest-performing schools — along with other schools across the state. But it also drew criticism from parents and teachers for the suggested requirement of hiring new principals and making teachers re-apply for their jobs.\n\nWhile some downstate Priority Schools, like Laurel Middle School, made gains in test scores, Wilmington's schools saw little to no progress.\n\nSLOW IMPROVEMENT:How Delaware's struggling schools performed on the 2018 state tests\n\nUnder Carney, Markell’s Priority Schools plan was replaced with the Wilmington Schools Partnership, an ongoing agreement between Christina and the state, and the latest iteration of attempting to improve student achievement in city schools.\n\nThe partnership includes state funding for new wellness centers, increased staffing and trauma-informed training.\n\nCHRISTINA CONSOLIDATION:Teachers, students say goodbye to 3 Wilmington schools as Christina consolidates\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL:Some Wilmington students start early in effort for better schools\n\nIt also consolidated Christina’s five city schools into two buildings, a lofty logistical task that had some parents and teachers wondering if it was a good idea to combine elementary and middle school students in the same building.\n\nBecause of the consolidation, the partnership included funding for school renovations to accommodate the increased number of students in each building.\n\nThe district is halfway through its first year of consolidation. Students from Elbert-Palmer, Casimir Pulaski and Stubbs elementary schools were combined and split between Bancroft and Bayard schools. Stubbs was also converted to a dual education center.\n\nThrough the partnership, the state has invested $31.6 million into capital improvements at Bancroft, Bayard and Stubbs.\n\nNatalia Alamdari covers education for The News Journal.

She plugged the drain, turned on the water and then returned to Alex, Jones said.\n\nShe poured a different oil on Alex and tried to light him on fire again. She struck him repeatedly with a hammer and a frying pan. She also tried to strangle him, Jones said.\n\nShe then took him to the bath and held his head underwater for minutes, Jones said.\n\nShe told Jones she had considered burning the apartment.

Simpson Dean Sr., Moseley was a founder of the Fieldstone Golf Club in Greenville and an active member of the Vicmead Hunt Club and the Garden Club of Wilmington. She also encouraged basic medical and scientific research through a charitable foundation she established a dozen years ago.\n\n\"Lisa Dean Moseley was a highly respected member among her cousins,\" family patriarch Irenee du Pont Jr. of Granogue said. He was a first cousin of Moseley's mother. \"We are all mourning her loss.\"\n\nHer death marks the dwindling of the older generation of du Pont family members.\n\nShe is among the generation of du Ponts who came of age during the golden era of the DuPont Co., which brought enormous wealth and prestige to the family. This is a time when family members still controlled the giant chemical company and the du Pont name became synonymous with the world's greatest industrialists.\n\nAs a young woman, she was considered an exotic beauty thanks to looks that were \"passed down from a Lebanese great-grandmother,\" author Dominick Dunne wrote in the 1999 Vanity Fair article \"In Cold, Blue Blood.\"\n\n\"Like all really stylish women, Lisa Dean found her look early and never changed it,\" Dunne wrote. \"'Sleek' and 'glamorous' were the adjectives that applied to her. She looked rich, even before you knew she was.\"\n\nLater in life, however, Moseley's name became tied with several high-profile controversies.\n\nHer third husband, Christopher Moseley, was charged in 1998 with the contract murder of Patricia Margello – the girlfriend of his wife's son Simpson Dean MacGuigan.\n\nChristopher Moseley was accused of hiring three people to kill Margello, 45, a former South Philadelphia prostitute, because he did not approve of her relationship with MacGuigan. He later testified in court that he and his wife blamed Margello for MacGuigan's long-running drug problems. Margello's body was found Aug. 5, 1998, stuffed inside an air-conditioning duct in a Las Vegas motel.\n\nShe had been badly beaten, strangled and put into a plastic garbage bag.\n\nChristopher Moseley later confessed to ordering the killing and paying hit man Ricardo Murillo, ex-porn actress Diana Hironaga and Joseph Balignasa $15,000 to commit the crime. He was convicted in the murder plot and sentenced in Las Vegas in March 2000 to 16 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $100,000 in fines. He died in prison on May 25, 2004.\n\nSTORY: Tom Gordon again faces trouble with closest ally\n\nSTORY: Nemours opens up with season passes\n\nA day after her husband's death, the chemical fortune heiress' name surfaced in a federal corruption case indictment that said she had loaned $2.3 million to Sherry Freebery – who was top aide to New Castle County Executive Tom Gordon at the time. This was during the first two terms he held office.\n\nAccording to the 47-page indictment, there was a scheme – run by Freebery – to help the developer of the Fieldstone Golf Club obtain the necessary permits for a clubhouse. Moseley, who was identified in the indictment only by her initials, had \"loaned\" Freebery more than $2 million between 2000 and 2001. In March 2001 she left Freebery a message stating \"SOS. Please call asap - need help with Fieldstone,\" according to the indictment.\n\nThe written message was found in Freebery's bedroom during a 2002 search of her home, according to the indictment.\n\nA county employee wrote on the clubhouse permit \"Chief, we deliver,\" after Freebery made arrangements for the permit, according to the indictment. The indictment accused Gordon and Freebery of creating false documents to cover up Freebery's receipt of the $2 million and her involvement in the permit process. It also alleged they pulled related documents out of county files and spent more than $30,000 of county money hiring lawyers to threaten The News Journal in its attempts to investigate the matter.\n\nThe indictment accused the pair of spending $13,000 of taxpayer money hiring two law firms to research ways Freebery could hide the money.\n\nIt also included statements that Gordon made about the situation: \"She [Freebery] shouldn't have done it,\" the indictment said. \"It was interference, and we're all gonna end up in a [expletive] jam.\" The indictment did not say when or to whom the statement was made.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2007 in exchange for lesser pleas. Freebery pleaded guilty to one felony count of making a false statement to a bank for failing to include on a mortgage application that she had a $2.3 million loan from Moseley. She was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to pay $350 in fines and court costs.\n\nMoseley's name later surfaced, this time when her first cousin Richard S. du Pont filed for bankruptcy in April 2012. Like other Delaware residents, he sought protection from the federal court as a result of the economic slump. According to the bankruptcy petition, Moseley lent her cousin $50,000.\n\nLater that year, her name came up again in relation to New Castle County politics. This time when Gordon selected then-Capt. Elmer Setting to be the chief of county police. Setting disclosed then that he, his wife and their three daughters had been renting their Greenville home from Moseley for the last 13 years.\n\nHe continues to live there, however, until recently the living arrangement was not included publicly in his financial interest disclosures that public officials must file with the county.\n\nSetting's 2014 statement of financial interest was originally filed in April 2015 and amended in February to note the cash-free arrangement. In the form, Setting said he provides security and maintenance in exchange for residing on the property. Setting's 2013 filing, his only other since becoming chief, makes no mention of the arrangement. Disclosure forms for 2015 were due May 1.\n\nJulie Sebring, an attorney for the New Castle County Ethics Commission, could not comment on what prompted Setting to file the February update more thoroughly laying out his living arrangement for citizens. She said there is no active ethics commission investigation tied to the arrangement.\n\nSetting has not returned multiple calls on the issue and declined comment through a spokesman. Gordon's administration also declined comment on the change through a spokeswoman.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

None were on the first day of a tournament.\n\n“Overall I can’t really say I hit any great shots, but I hit a lot of good ones,” Woods said. “I hit the ball better than what my score indicates.”\n\nTwo weeks ago at the U.S. Open, Woods had the highest 36-hole score of his pro career — 156.\n\nWoods came to Greenbrier ranked No. 202 in the world and faced with the prospect of missing cuts in consecutive tournaments for the first time since 1994.\n\nFor one round, at least, his solid game returned.\n\n“Overall, if you drive the ball well here, you’re going to probably have at least seven shots with 9-iron or below into the greens, and you’re going to have to capitalize on that,” Woods said. “So far I’m one of those guys who did.”\n\nWoods started on the back nine Thursday and birdied three of his first seven holes. He made bogey on the par-5 17th after his drive went into a hazard to the right, and a double bogey from a greenside bunker on the sixth hole left him at 1 under on his round.\n\nWoods said he adjusted his aim later in the round after noticing that playing partners Steve Stricker and David Lingmerth were missing putts on the high side of the hole.\n\n“I lowered my line just a touch, maybe half a ball here and there, and it seemed to pay off,” he said.\n\nWoods finished with three straight birdies, making bending putts of 18 and 19 feet on the final two holes.\n\n“Just trying to get back to 3 (under), and we just happened to pull off a hat trick coming home,” he said.\n\nJonathan Byrd and Danny Lee were a stroke behind Langley after 7-under 63s. Brian Davis and Ryo Ishikawa were at 64.\n\nFriends Langley and Byrd both said they fed off each other during their morning round. They were tied at 7 under before Langley surged ahead with a short birdie putt at the par-4 16th.\n\nNeither has a top 10 finish this season and both need some solid results to be among the 125 qualifiers for the FedEx Cup playoffs starting in late August.\n\n“I got a little down on myself earlier in the year because the results weren’t really there,” Langley said. “I kind of looked at myself in the mirror and said, you know, at the end of the day, I need to be the most positive guy in the field week in and week out.”\n\nLangley, seeking his first win on the PGA Tour, finished 25th at the Travelers Championship a week ago. He hit 17 greens in regulation in his bogey-free round Thursday.\n\nByrd is in the tournament on a sponsor’s exemption.\n\n“I’m very thankful just to be in the field this week,” he said.\n\nFans were certainly glad to see George McNeill and Justin Thomas.\n\nBoth made holes-in-one on the par-3 18th, triggering advertised tournament payouts of $100 to fans at the hole for McNeill’s ace and $500 for Thomas’ feat, or a total of about $192,000. The next hole-in-one at any point in the tournament on the 18th would net fans $1,000 apiece.\n\nThe tournament also gave McNeill $25,000 and Thomas $50,000 for the charities of their choice.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/07/29/allen-harim-plant-harm-millsboro-area-study-says/30855281/", "title": "Allen Harim plant would harm Millsboro area, study says", "text": "Phil Davis\n\nDelmarva Media Group\n\nA proposed Millsboro-area poultry plant would pollute the community’s air and soil and further hurt the community’s already poor health conditions, a University of Maryland study says.\n\nAn Allen Harim Foods poultry plant “will likely result in increased level of air and water pollution” as well as pollute the surrounding area’s air and soil from diesel exhaust, the study says.\n\nThe study’s findings largely condemn Allen Harim Foods’ intention to build the plant on the former Vlasic Pickle plant site, which it purchased in 2013.\n\n“The Harim plant should move to a more remote area with fewer existing sources of pollution and fewer residents dealing with adverse health effects,” the study recommends.\n\nCalled a “Rapid Health Impact Assessment,” the study focuses on both the potential impact the plant would have as well as the area’s poor environmental health because of other factories and plants nearby.\n\nThe study points to the fact that the site was classified as a brownfield “due to the presence of existing contaminants” like arsenic, cobalt and hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAllen Harim had actually wanted the brownfield designation from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control because it allowed the company to apply for nearly $225,000 in reimbursements for the site’s cleanup.\n\nHowever, with higher lung cancer rates when compared with the rest of the state and country, the study says residents “are overburdened with pollution from multiple sources” and the new plant could potentially make those problems worse.\n\nSpecifically, the size of the plant is a point of contention in the study. Allen Harim wants the 107-acre site to process 2 million small “ginseng” chickens a week for customers based in South Korea and U.S. Asian markets.\n\n“The projected size and amount of poultry to be processed at the Harim Millsboro plant will likely result in increased levels of air and water pollution,” the study reads.\n\nThe study points to increased truck traffic to the plant as well as the large amounts of water needed for chicken processing as the potential causes of that pollution.\n\nSince 2013, state officials and the company have argued studies on the site found contamination, but did not find them to pose “undue risk” to surrounding residents.\n\nIn 2014, DNREC and representatives of Allen Harim argued the site had been thoroughly examined, with Allen Harim attorney Jeremy Homer saying the former plant “is not a really very dirty site” to begin with.\n\nThe project is also supported by Delaware Gov. Jack Markell’s administration.\n\nThe site could employ up to 700 people in an area where nearly 16 percent of its residents don’t have a high school diploma and unemployment rates are higher than the state average.\n\nHowever, residents have pushed back, as the number of large plants in the area are potentially linked to the higher instances of lung cancer and respiratory disease.\n\nNearby residents also were a major part of the study’s reasoning, with hundreds of residents and two area schools close to the site.\n\n“Within a two-mile radius of the Harim Millsboro site, there are approximately 533 single-family homes, 247 trailer homes, 240 townhouses, 45-60 apartments, and two schools,” the study reads.\n\n“Poultry processing plants use approximately seven gallons of water per bird, which might lead to a depletion of groundwater resources for existing residents,” it continues. “In addition, Harim Millsboro’s plant operation would cause the entry of significant amounts of [organ meats] and other processing by-products into the water.”\n\nThe study also says government officials “did not actively involve the residents in the political process.”\n\nInterest groups allege the Sussex County Planning and Zoning Office did not provide a written notice to interested parties, nor seek input from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, the study says.\n\n“During a meeting with concerned residents and members of Protecting Our Indian River, many remarked they would not have previously purchased their homes if they had known about the processing plant coming to their neighborhood,” the study reads.\n\nA representative from Allen Harim could not be reached.\n\nContact Phil Davis at pdavis3@dmg.gannett.com or (410) 877-4221.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/06/05/hallie-biden-hunter-biden-trial-biden-girlfriend/73982642007/", "title": "Beau Biden's widow expected to testify.

He moved to the Powell area in '98 to be closer to family. He followed that early passion into a career as an advanced emergency medical technician for Grainger County EMS as well as Priority Ambulance of Knoxville.\n\nIn addition to his work as an emergency first responder, Birchfiel has cultivated a hobby of restoring sirens and lights.\n\nBut his most recent project is an absolute doozy. He will be working to resurrect one of Knoxville’s old air raid sirens that was decommissioned about 40 years ago.\n\nSharing an experience\n\nLocated on a Knoxville Utilities Board property was a relic of the Cold War, a large air raid siren mounted on a pole similar to a telephone pole. Birchfiel got permission to take it away. With the help of friend Tyler Sanders from Fountain City Wrecker Service, the monstrous artifact was hauled away.\n\nThe siren bell and rotating housing weigh 300 pounds, the blower box is anywhere between 800-1,000 pounds and the control panel is 150 pounds. Everything but the blower box is stored in Birchfiel’s backyard shed.\n\n“I’ve worked on smaller motors before, but never anything like this,” he said. “It’s interesting and neat to see how it’s all put together.”\n\nBirchfiel plans on sharing the restoration experience with his daughters Jessica, 15, and Brittany, 13. “This is an excellent history lesson for them,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always been into history,” Jessica said. “To think that this was part of the Cold War era is pretty neat. I’ve worked on (refurbishing) lights before, so I know the basic ins and outs of motors.”\n\nAdvice available\n\nBirchfiel said the blare of the siren was designed to reach 2.2 miles. When he finally gets it all taken apart, sanded down, repainted, and all the non-working parts replaced, he’s eager to finally flip the switch and see what it’s got.\n\n“I’ve talked to a lot of people in the neighborhood about the project and most are very interested,” he said. “It seems to have a lot of support. The history aspect is important to a lot of people. They’re not worried about how loud it will be.”\n\nBirchfiel and his daughters aren’t in this project alone. He said there are several Facebook groups specifically devoted to the restoration of air raid sirens. He met Matthew Adderholt of Chattanooga in one of those groups. He has leaned on Adderholt for a lot of advice along the way.\n\n“There are a lot of clubs in the U.S. for air raid siren enthusiasts,” he said. “There are auctions around the country for people who would like to restore them. There are siren meets so that you can share what you have.”\n\nWhat Birchfiel has now is a project. And a passion. And a goal.\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\nThe Maker City Summit — virtually a huge success during the pandemic\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News\n\nOver the second weekend of September, the Mayor’s Maker Council held its Fifth Annual Maker City Summit as usual. And yet, not as usual.\n\nIt was, of course, all virtual.\n\nFrom the Saturday morning introduction by Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon — who sported a pair of locally made earrings from Cold Gold — to the final speaker, Stephen Brown of Glitterville — a Rockwood, Tennessee, native who turned himself into a global brand — the inspiration, advice and activity just kept coming.\n\nKeynote speakers were Van Tucker of Launch TN; Regina Bonds, “The Confidence Coach\"; and Brown, who presented their own stories as well as invaluable insights, techniques and suggestions for the participants gathered at virtual tables provided by the award-winning online Lunchpool platform. Mimicking a banquet hall with stage, speakers and graphic digital presentations, “it was like a Zoom meeting on steroids,” said one attendant. “I mean, in a good way.”\n\nWorkshops came in a huge variety — digital marketing; how to start, maintain and grow a small business; accounting; website maximization; legal concerns, and how to avoid burnout, rediscover one’s creative passion and take really good photographs.\n\nPresenting experts included Terrence Carter of the Knoxville Urban League; Eric Amarante of the UT College of Law; Adrienne Webster of Adrienne Webster Accounting; Bob Camp of CAMPCast LLC; Catherine Porth-Cahill of Let Her Speak and Frank Ramey of the Knoxville Business Advisor; Allie Mounce and Clare Freeman of Pretty Useful Co.; Kelle Jolly of the Women in Jazz Jam Festival; Austin Church of Balernum; Hannah Lee and Jess Vossler of Second Mile Marketing; and Shawn Poynter of Poynter Photography.\n\nInteractive sessions featuring even more local experts, available to all-access passholders, continued for two weeks post-Summit.\n\nThe first day’s session was concluded by Chris McAdoo, painter, entrepreneur, motivational speaker, podcaster and former strategic advisor to Designsensory Inc.\n\nLisa Hood Skinner, former senior vice president at Ackermann PR and now a multi-industry freelance independent contractor who specializes in brand messaging across digital platforms for multiple international companies, said, “I valued all of the different sessions, but loved Chris McAdoo, who proved hands-down to be one of the most enthusiastically creative artists/speakers/entrepreneurs I know. If some Summit attendees didn’t hang in there the first day, turning off the conference before he spoke, they need to go to the video recording and watch his talk.”\n\nMcAdoo spoke not only of business and creative matters, but also of an almost-fatal health crisis earlier this year which helped him to realize the anxiety and stress he was under, and the shift he needed in his own focus. Skinner said the talk “made me realize I won’t want a ‘come to Jesus moment’ to remind me that my passion, my truth, is in doing what I love doing the most — writing. It may not pay what I was making before. But I get up most mornings happy and excited to hit my craft for another day.”\n\nThat very spirit is what The Maker City Summit is all about.\n\nThe entire event was recorded, and access to recordings was included with the all-access pass. Online access is available for $15 to those who were unable to attend.

They won’t have to worry about meals; we’ve got them covered.”\n\nGoing strong for 34 years, the golf tournament is the longest running major fundraiser for the school. This year, there were more than 45 teams and 55 sponsors including Avalon Golf and Country Club, Pinnacle Financial Partners and Pilot Company.\n\n“We raised more money than last year because the sponsors, knowing what they were contributing to, really stepped up to the plate to support the kids most impacted by the pandemic,” Erpenback said.\n\nThe tournament was originally slated for June but had to be postponed, like most events, due to the pandemic.\n\nTournament organizers adhered to guidelines limiting the number of people inside during registration.\n\nThe event started with an “Irish Legends” award ceremony outside honoring ’91 alum Josh Turbyville, who consistently goes above and beyond the expected.\n\n“Josh is the nicest person who will do anything we ask of him. He’s the ultimate Irish volunteer. Anything he can do he will do. He goes above and beyond for Knoxville Catholic High School as well as many other organizations throughout Knoxville,” Erpenback said.\n\nThe morning round was won by Anthony DeSelice Jr., Justine Clevenstine, Sean Greenway and Robbie Martin. The afternoon round was won by Jay Coatney, T.J. Hammondtree, Nathan Schmidt and Clint James.\n\nThe next fundraiser is the Green and Gold Gala, which normally happens in January, but has been pushed to late spring.\n\nInfo: www.knoxvillecatholic.com.\n\nMore:What made Bearden High Class of 1970 unique?

By the end of September, new owners Leigh and Billy Lowe will be ready to buy gently used children’s clothing, footwear, toys, books and baby gear to sell in the store.\n\nThe couple have spent most of their lives in Texas and Ohio, but they wanted to escape the heat and enjoy all four seasons. After driving through Knoxville and experiencing Market Square in the fall, they fell in love with the area and could not get it out of their minds.\n\nThey decided to settle in Seymour two years ago, and after Billy Lowe retired they started looking for a franchise to start.\n\nTheir youngest daughter was writing a research paper for her accounting degree on the Minneapolis-based franchise and told them Once Upon a Child had a great success rate.\n\n“Billy started researching it,” said Leigh Lowe, who had been a customer since the birth of her first grandchild.\n\nThe Lowes spent the past year looking for the perfect location before moving into the former Verizon building at 5034 N. Broadway. “There is a ton of activity out here,” added Billy Lowe. “That’s why we love it. There’s a diversity of businesses and proximity to homeowners. It’s buzzing.”\n\n“It’s a great location, and actually the size of two shops and 3,000 square feet,” added Leigh Lowe. “We started the build out in June and took out walls, built new walls, painted, had new carpet installed and added the racks.”\n\nThe Lowes have been recruiting a team of employees and have just started training and orientating them through the Once Upon a Child processes.\n\nOnce Upon a Child buys and sells clothing and shoes from newborn through youth size 20.\n\n“Ride-on toys are a big hit for younger children,” said Leigh Lowe. “People are always looking for strollers, and toys in general.”\n\nBouncy chairs, highchairs, and pack ‘n plays are likely to all be in high demand.\n\nNo appointment is necessary, according to the Lowes. Just stop by with your gently used items to sell; the staff will review them and make an offer based on the style and condition. If the offer is accepted, they pay cash on the spot.\n\n“We suggest people bring clothes in cleanly laundered and laid flat in a bin,” said Leigh Lowe. “Hopefully it will take 20-30 minutes. We will sort through them and give them an offer on what we would like to buy and let them know what we can’t really buy.”\n\nTo save time, items should be in good condition, have no stains and only some reasonable wear and tear, according to Leigh Lowe. “We have a computer system that automatically generates a price, so we don’t favor someone over another,” she added.\n\n“I think because we have been quarantined, people have been home and reviewing the items they don’t really need anymore,” said Billy Lowe. “Instead of a straight up donation, we offer a value for those items.”\n\nHaving a well-organized store that appeals to their customers’ experience is important to the couple.\n\n“We want them to be able to come in and find what they are looking for, where it is supposed to be,” said Billy Lowe. “Customers can bring in items to sell and while we go through them to make an offer, they are able to shop and pick out the next size.”\n\nThe store will be open 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Saturday and noon-5 p.m. on Sunday.\n\n“We offer cash for all seasons of clothing, all of the time, so don’t wait, bring it in,” said Billy Lowe. “If you don’t need it and the condition is good, bring it.”\n\nFollow @OnceuponachildFountainCityTN for an update on their official opening and upcoming grand opening celebration.\n\nMore:First Watch Turkey Creek has new look, new brunch cocktails\n\nMore:'Andy Griffith' character's lookalike pops up everywhere, and he's making a movie!\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nAmid concrete, carcinogens and chaos, 'Do not worry'\n\nJohn Tirro, Shopper News columnist\n\nAs I sit on my concrete bench, at my concrete table, in between meeting with students and congregation members during my outdoor office hours, I wonder what people are learning right now.\n\nI see staff of the university congregating for cigarette breaks, more or less 6 feet apart, unmasked, of course. It’s hard to put a lit cigarette to your lips and breathe smoke with a mask on.\n\nThankfully, outdoors seems to be a \"get out of jail free\" card, with nearly infinite dispersal of air. I imagine there’s some mood management going on, nicotine adjusting blood flow and chemical balance, long term bad but short term easing something.\n\nTruth be told, I’m generally on my phone or computer, managing something or checking on someone, when I’m not with a person in person, so it’s only now as I sit to write that I notice these smoking groups that have been in my peripheral vision up to now.\n\nSo one thing I’m learning is that there are people in my field of vision, out to the edges, that I’d like to know better. Is there someone at the edge of your vision, that you might like to know better?\n\nOver my head, when I’m out for office hours, is a beautiful vine of orange trumpet flowers. Several years ago, there was a majestic evergreen, 90 feet high, that shaded these tables, but it got a beetle and died.\n\nFor a while, it was harsh out front of the campus ministry, three concrete tables with no shade. Evening worship had a distractingly intense glow, as sunset beamed straight through the windows into half the chapel’s eyes.\n\nSo we built a pergola, upright posts with crossbeams, across the front of the ministry. We planted tiny vines by the posts, spindly redbuds a few feet out in the yard, and a line of baby mountain laurels along the sidewalk.\n\nEight years later, laurels are a hedge, redbuds form a canopy, and trumpet flowers thickly cover the trellis, with hummingbirds and honeybees constantly dipping in. We moved half the benches out under the redbuds, so seating is spaced by 9 to 12 feet. It’s a wonderful place to talk, safely, face to face. Is there something in your life, that’s more helpful than you expected?\n\nAs we talk, students and I, or students with each other — or, recently, a guy with a pet squirrel in a tiny, leather Harley jacket — another thing we’re learning is a new rhythm of patience. Diesel pickups and delivery trucks go by, and you can keep talking, but no one will hear you. And you can get irritated. Or you can pause, collect your thoughts, then unpause. It’s surprisingly restful. Might some changes lately be gifts?\n\n“Do not worry about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7).\n\nMore:Late-season South Carolina games have been fateful for Tennessee football | Mike Strange\n\nPOWELL\n\nPowell football's response to pandemic? 'Awesome'\n\nAl Lesar, Shopper News\n\nControl is the variable that’s lacking in the coronavirus pandemic situation.\n\nChad Smith, athletic director at Powell High School for the last six years, recognized that as he prepared the Panther fall sports teams — and the fans — for competition in these trying times.\n\n“We looked at the things we were able to control,” Smith said of the coaching staff’s approach to the fall. “We have control over what our kids, our coaches and our fans do. That’s what we chose to focus on. The great thing… They’ve all responded to the challenge.”\n\nEverybody involved has become as obsessed as Smith with wearing a mask or similar face covering. Students have bought into the one-way hallways that have relieved congestion in the always-crowded school. Football fans have gotten into the habit of buying their prepackaged concession food on an app to avoid cash and long lines.\n\n“Everybody’s viewpoint on the pandemic is different,” Smith said. “But from the governor to the schools, we’ve all come together. We’re all in this together.”\n\nNew normal\n\nIt didn’t take long for Powell’s season to be interrupted. Greeneville backed out of the season-opener because of virus issues, but Beech filled the gap. Powell’s fifth game of the season, against Clinton, was also abandoned for the same reason.\n\nOther area schools have had similar situations.\n\n“You never know, you could be next,” Smith said. “Nothing shocks me. Before the season, we were prepared for pockets to pop up. We only have control of us.\n\n“Actually, this has gone a thousand times better than we saw it going (earlier in the summer). We’re a few weeks into the season and we’re playing football. We aren’t taking that for granted.”\n\nThat’s why a socially-distant pregame meeting with officials, footballs being wiped down regularly during the game, masks or helmets being worn at all times and players keeping themselves 6 feet apart on the sidelines, and student fans in the one-third full bleachers being reminded to wear a mask or leave are all part of the new normal.\n\nTrust is key\n\nBefore Smith took over as athletic director, he was a coach for 15 years. That experience has been invaluable in the leadership role he has had to take during the past seven months.\n\n“If this is going to work, the coaches have to trust you,” Smith said. “They know I’m one of them. That’s why when I say, ‘This is what we need to do to get better,’ they believe me.\n\n“Without trust, I wouldn’t be able to get anything out of them. We all believe in the same vision.”\n\nEvery week, Smith is holding his breath with the other coaches hoping this isn’t the time when it’s Powell’s turn to go through a two-week hiatus in any sport because of a positive test. It doesn’t take much, and everyone knows it.\n\n“Once we got some guidance (from TSSAA and Knox County) in what can be done, it really helped what we were able to do,” Smith said. “We had a game plan. We just needed to make it work. Some people might have thought we were overboard, but everything is about the health of our students, staff and fans.\n\n“Our kids have been awesome. They’ve really responded. We’re able to be playing football, which is great for everybody.”\n\nMore:Cheesy puns no extra charge at Just Say Queso food truck\n\nMore:Drive-through fresh Mexican fare coming to former Bearden Chick-fil-A\n\nKARNS\n\nKarns loves its parade of tractors\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News\n\nThere’s no doubt about it, Karns loves its tractors. A Karns parade just isn’t complete without the loud rumble of antique tractors coming down the street greeted by cheers from the crowd. Most, but not all, are beautifully restored John Deeres.\n\nOne standout is a red Farmall owned by Preacherman Henry Lenoir, frequently garnering the loudest cheers.\n\nMike Gordon, owner of Gordon’s Drug Store, owns seven tractors and has been collecting them for 20 years.\n\nGordon started his collection by looking for his grandfather’s tractor. He did manage to find it, but the new owner wouldn’t sell. In the process, he found others he liked, including a 1929 John Deere.\n\n“I bought one or two that were good deals, now I have seven,” he said.\n\n“I did find my grandfather’s tractor, but I haven’t convinced the owner to sell it to me yet.”\n\nIn any given parade, four or five of the tractors belong to Gordon. They’re driven by his circle of friends.\n\n“We all grew up on tractors. Years ago, there were lots more of them in the parade than there are today. It wasn’t uncommon to see 15 to 20 tractors. Now there are about eight or nine.\n\n“For years I drove one of mine in the parades and my daughters rode in the lift throwing out candy. There would always be at least one tractor pulling a wagon with a bunch of kids riding. It was a fun time for everyone; still is, I guess.”\n\nToday it is not uncommon to see the Fairest of the Fair court riding on a wagon pulled by a John Deere tractor.\n\nThe excitement of the parade builds when the tractors arrive at the staging area at Ingles Markets from Beaver Ridge Road. Early birds staking out their spot near the start of the parade route cheer for the tractors as they cross Oak Ridge Highway.\n\nIt’s hard to miss 17-year-old Austin Hensley driving his 1947 John Deere he refurbished with his father when he was just 2 years old. Today, Hensley owns three with his eye on the fourth.\n\n“I fell in love with tractors when I was around 2 when my dad bought a rusty old 1947 John Deere and we worked on it together. I’ve been hooked ever since. I love to fix them up; it’s in my blood I guess,” said Hensley.\n\nMaybe the tractors are so popular because they are a reminder of a bygone era when Karns was largely a farming community and everyone knew their neighbors, having seen them often working the fields on a sturdy tractor.\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\nPhyllis Wheatley Center wants to help virtual learners, families\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News\n\nWhen you’re trying to plan for families and their school-age kids at the start of the school year for a no-end-in-sight pandemic, there are thousands of details to be worked out.\n\nMonica Smith-Albright, the YWCA Phyllis Wheatley Center’s executive director since August, knows all about that. With a master’s degree in public health from UT, she’s got a stellar background in child, family and educational services — most recently with Project GRAD, her last position before coming on at the Wheatley center.\n\nAnd when the center stepped up with its new Virtual Home Away from Home Program for Knox County middle- and high-schoolers who’ve opted for virtual learning, she had an eye toward the small things that can make or break a student’s success.\n\n“She hit the ground running,” says Karlyn Reel, the YWCA’s director of public relations. “Monica’s done a really good job of seeing ‘what could that barrier be?’”\n\nOne immediate concern was space, especially considering social distancing precautions. The center did have a long-standing modular classroom to its rear, and they’d already consulted with Maryville-based construction company Clayton, national builder of off-site and on-site-built homes and longtime supporters of the YWCA, who had determined the classroom was structurally sound and cosmetic repairs would be the most cost-effective option.\n\nClayton team members volunteered their time — almost daily since February — and the company donated materials. Office Furniture Outfitters on Grand Avenue near UT donated tables and chairs.\n\nNow the center has 2,000 square feet of extra space, and — thanks to Smith-Albright — all the details in place. They’re ready to accommodate middle- through high school students who have opted for remote learning, so that they have a place to go when their parents are at work.\n\n“Youth come to the center each day, have working Wi-Fi, receive a snack and lunch and support from YWCA staff to complete their virtual school,” says Reel. Such a program, in such a fresh, newly renovated space, solves a multitude of problems that families may be facing during this uncertain time.\n\nAnd as always, the center’s After-School Enrichment Program continues.\n\nThis Friday, those interested in enrollment for either the virtual learning or the after-school program are invited to an open house.\n\n“We want to increase student participation,” says Smith-Albright, who keeps a close watch on the status of the Knox County School System and its pandemic color-coding. “We are better together and so grateful to Clayton for seeing the mission and vision of our program. Our youth have a newfound ownership of their new and improved space!”\n\nThe YWCA Phyllis Wheatley Center’s open house happens from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. this Friday, Sept. 18, at 124 S. Cruze Street.

Some information at the Knoxville History Project website says the Third Creek bottomland has been used by the public since the 1890s, and that at one time a nine-hole golf course had been in the area.\n\nThe park land was evidently donated to the city in 1929 by Bettie Tyson after the death of her husband, U.S. Sen. Lawrence Tyson. She also donated land for an airport along Sutherland Avenue about the same time and stipulated that the airport be named in honor of her son, C. McGhee Tyson, a World War I pilot killed in the North Sea.\n\nThe old Tyson Junior High opened just up the hill from the park in 1936 and was named for Lawrence Tyson. Across the creek are some long and steep steps accessible to the old school building — now used for offices.\n\nOn the north end of Tyson Park sits a ballfield used by nearby West High, while on the immediate south side of it is the skateboard park. The latter looks almost like several empty swimming pools with all the steep walls that no doubt provide thrills and occasional spills for young skateboarders.\n\nOf course, many Lady Vols fans remember when the earlier thrills here were watching legendary pitcher Monica Abbott and her Tennessee softball teammates produce some outstanding teams under coaches Ralph and Karen Weekly. Despite the small seating, they played well enough to reach the Women’s College World Series before moving to larger Sherri Parker Lee Stadium in 2008. The old press box/concession stand building and bleachers remain.\n\nAcross the parking area from the skatepark is one of the two green spaces where one can find enjoyment simply by sitting and standing still, although the scene is a little more tranquil for the eyes than the ears, due to the noisy Alcoa Highway overpass.\n\nJust west of the greenspace is the Kyle Testerman tennis courts/Tyson Family Tennis Center. The 14 courts were named in honor of the former Knoxville mayor and tennis enthusiast, whose son, Ben Testerman, was an Australian Open semifinalist in 1984.\n\n“(Kyle) Testerman played tennis at the University of Tennessee and was instrumental in the development of this tennis complex in Tyson Park,” said Hester.\n\nHe added that the complex — which also features lines for pickleball on some of the courts — hosts tennis leagues and clinics for all ages and skill levels.\n\n“Many high schools play matches at Tyson in the spring,” he added.\n\nSurrounding the tennis complex is a large grassy area of pavilions (including one mid-century one), a large playground rebuilt in 2019 after a flood, a unique restroom building and a long stretch of the Third Creek greenway path meandering through some landscaping.\n\nThe greenway path has made Tyson Park a through area in addition to the destination place it has been since it opened.\n\nAcross the creek — which looks like a tempting place to wade in the warm weather, when no heavy rains have occurred — is a grassy area with picnic tables Accessible via a pedestrian bridge, it appears to have likely changed little since the park opened, unless it was formerly wooded.\n\nThe uniquely shaped 25.4-acre park continues south under the Alcoa Highway overpass, and a further strip of the park that includes small picnic shelters, the greenway path and the creek can be found here. Hester calls this area a mostly passive greenway space.\n\nWhile any park located near an urban center like downtown Knoxville can draw people in need and others, Hester said the busy activity in Tyson Park, especially in the late afternoons, keeps it generally free of users being hassled.\n\n“The more active a park is, the less non-park users want to be there,” he said.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nFarragut food trucks, town center district discussed\n\nGabriela Szymanowska, Shopper News\n\nThe Farragut Planning Commission continued last month’s workshop discussion on food trucks during the Sept. 17 meeting, approving the ordinance for homeowners associations to host food trucks for special events within neighborhoods.\n\nLast month, food trucks sparked a discussion focused on homeowners associations bringing trucks into subdivisions. Before the approval of the agenda item, food trucks were allowed only for commercial and office use and not-for-profit entities. But because of the coronavirus pandemic and need for social distancing, some subdivisions decided to get together with neighbors to enjoy a friendly bite.\n\nDuring Thursday’s meeting, Commissioner Betty Dick brought up concerns about safety and space, especially if the trucks were to be parked on small neighborhood streets. However, since homeowners associations would be the ones sponsoring the food trucks, there would need to be guaranteed space, ideally at a clubhouse, where parking would be readily available.\n\nBefore passing the ordinance, the commission clarified that food trucks would be able to have only a three-day special event permit, while permits for signs could be up to 10 days.\n\nWhile all local government meetings are still currently held online because of Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order banning in-person meetings, the commission discussed public comment protocol for when in-person sessions resume.\n\nCitizens who would wish to speak at a Planning Commission meeting would need to fill out a blue card and hand it to the Planning director or designated staff member. One minor change in the protocol ensures that citizen comments are from Farragut residents, with the commission adding that comments can also be made by Farragut property and business owners.\n\nThe planning commission also discussed changes to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, updating the document as it relates to the town center and descriptors. Vice Mayor Louise Povlin suggested several changes, the key edits focusing on prioritizing pedestrian activity and walkability in the town center district while still accommodating vehicular activity.\n\nCommissioner Ed St. Claire also pointed out concerns regarding the traffic that could impact Old Concord Road, which already has a choke point between the two cemeteries that keeps the road from expanding.\n\nA traffic impact study will also have to be done before moving further with construction. Mayor Ron Williams added that some of the traffic issues could also be addressed with the replacement of the lights at the intersection of Kingston Pike and Concord Road, giving town administrators more control of the timers to help with the flow of traffic.\n\nThe community had a lot to say during the citizens forum, with comments reading for 19 pages. Many of the comments revolved around the town center district, with concerns raised about topics including the potential large influx of traffic, decrease in property value, safety concerns and increased school enrollment in Farragut schools. To hear all the comments and concerns read at the meeting, visit the Town’s YouTube page.\n\nOPINION\n\nAnother married people moment\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nMy husband is grilling salmon on the back deck when he gets an idea. He comes into the kitchen, waiving his spatula, and says, “I know the tomatoes we planted this summer were a bust, but I think we should try to grow something new, like a fall crop.”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” I say vaguely. “What vegetables were you thinking of planting.” He pauses for a moment and says, “The kind that grow in the fall.” I laugh and go back to making a salad to pair with the fish. I don’t give the vegetable garden another thought.\n\nA few days later, we’re out on the back deck when my dying tomato plants catch his eye. “Those poor tomatoes,” he says, teasing me. “They didn’t stand a chance with you as their caretaker. We’ll do better with our fall garden, I hope.” I smile and nod appropriately before heading down the steps to play fetch with Buttercup.\n\nAbout a week later, he’s standing over a hot grill talking about his day. I’m listening and asking probing questions while he’s turning the late-summer corn I bought earlier in the day. The corn reminds him of fall vegetables. Again.\n\n“We can’t grow corn, obviously, but maybe we can grow some kind of squash in those raised planters. Or Kale. Does kale grow in the fall?”\n\n“I have no idea,” I say absently. “I’m just the tomato killer, remember?”\n\nWe walk back into the kitchen, and he’s still talking about fall vegetables. I have no vegetable wisdom to offer so I stay silent. In my head I’m thinking, “Now there’s a man that loves a fall planting.”\n\nHis vegetable obsession continues into the next week. It starts at the grill (again) which is clearly a trigger for the fall garden conversation. “Maybe we can plant radishes,” he says, holding a plate of grilled chicken thighs. “We like radishes. Do they grow in the fall?”\n\nI stare at him blankly. I’ve run out of offhand comments to make concerning vegetables. Then a thought occurs to me; a light bulb goes off in my head and suddenly I understand why we’ve been talking about vegetables for weeks on end.\n\n“Wait a minute,” I say. “All this time you’ve been talking to me about this mythical fall garden, were you thinking I was going to plant the vegetables?\"\n\nHe looks at me, sheepishly, and I continue talking. “You’re the one who wants a garden. All those questions about what vegetables grow in the fall? Were they your subtle way of getting me to do research about the vegetables you want to plant?”\n\nHe thinks about my words and laughs. “Yes,” he says, “I guess that’s what I was doing. I was invoking the marital 'royal we' hoping you would want to tackle the project.”\n\n“Huh,” I respond, amused by his revelation. “We are busy moving my parents from Ohio to Tennessee. We have no interest in planting a fall garden. But if you want to plant a fall garden, be my guest. You’ll just need to figure out what to plant first.”\n\nWe laugh at the absurdity of it all. I had been wondering about his fascination with vegetables and he had been wondering why I didn’t get busy and start planting.\n\n“We just had a married people moment,” I say, chuckling and shaking my head. “I hope we can learn from the experience.”\n\nAnd by “we,” I mean him.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snow column@aol.com.\n\nMore:President Trump disrespects Pamela Reeves by moving so fast on judicial nomination | Ashe", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/21"}]}

Signed, Delaware.\n\nSTORY: Free outdoor shows coming to downtown Wilmington\n\nEven though the festival boasts more than 100 craft beers on site from more than 40 local and regional breweries and a rare performance by Wilmington pop princes The Spinto Band, there's a good chance that the gathered crowd of beer geeks will spend part of the day looking upward at the future of downtown brewing.\n\nOrganizers hope the debut Downtown Brew-Fest will draw people into downtown in August, a traditionally slow time thanks to summer vacations and weekend beach getaways. The fact that the theater season at The Grand, The Queen and The Playhouse on Rodney Square is not in full swing doesn't help business either.\n\nBut judging on the response Brew-Fest organizers' Cinco de Mayo street festival on North Market Street received three months ago -- they planned for 500 and it drew 1,200 -- hopes are high.\n\n\"The rebuilding of Wilmington happens a brick at a time, but I think the revitalization of Wilmington happens an event at a time,\" says Joe Van Horn, the Chuck Taylor-wearing co-owner of Chelsea Tavern and Earnest & Scott Taproom and organizer of Downtown Brew-Fest, which is officially sponsored by the City of Wilmington.\n\nBrew-Fest will run from 1:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Saturday in the 800 block of North Market Street, which will be closed to traffic and lined with beer tents, food trucks, a beer garden and a large stage.\n\nAmong the Delaware-based breweries represented at the festival: 3rd Wave, 16 Mile, Bellefonte, Big Oyster, Blue Earl, Crooked Hammock, Dew Point, Dogfish Head, Mispillion River and Twin Lakes.\n\nThe recently re-formed Spinto Band, which played a surprise show at Wilmington rock club 1984 in June to prepare for a mini tour, has not played an announced show in Delaware since the act's 2013 New Year's Eve show at the former World Cafe Live at the Queen. In addition to the Spintos, Wilmington jam/funk cover band Groove Brothers Inc. and Newark-based singer/songwriter D. Corridori are also on the bill.\n\nGeneral admission is $35 and VIP is $50, which includes specialty beer samples and a private seated area on the sidewalk near Chelsea Tavern. Designated drivers and ages 12 to 18 cost $10 and ages 12 and under are $5. Organizers hope to draw at least 600 people.\n\nAll restaurants on the block will be open for the festival for seated meals to go along with the snacks from food trucks, such as Delaware Provision Company and Kapow. The tasting taps close at 5:30 p.m., but Chelsea Tavern and two outdoor satellite bars will remain open through 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe timing of the fest couldn't be better as Market Street prepares to welcome its first brewery in nearly 15 years with a fall opening scheduled.\n\nThe new chapter in the city's brewing history, which dates back to the mid-1800s, is being written with Stitch House set to be only the second downtown Wilmington brewery to produce its own beer in the more than six decades since the closure of Diamond State Brewing at Fifth and Adams streets in 1955.\n\nWhile the craft beer boom has sprouted breweries across the state from Greenville to Delmar over the years, it has largely left downtown Wilmington untouched.\n\nPrior to the opening of the 160-seat Stitch House, which is expected this fall, the only other downtown brewery was the aptly named Downtown Brewing Company, which was at 1210 N. Market St. The spot brewed its own beer during a three-year run that ended in 2003.\n\n(Brandywine Brewing Company at the corner of Ninth and Orange streets, where the new Bull Bay Caribbean Cuisine restaurant is located, was open for a short time in 2000, but did not make its beer on site. It was delivered from its Greenville location.)\n\n\"We're hoping to be open in the October range -- no later than November,\" says Stitch House's Sheridan. \"We actually have every piece of brewery equipment coming on Saturday, so we'll be going from having nothing in that space to -- boom! -- everything on one day.\"\n\nRecently, Sheridan has been consulting with John Medkeff Jr., a Delaware beer historian and author of 2015's \"Brewing in Delaware\" ($21.99, Arcadia Publishing). Expect to see historical photos of Delaware's brewing history on site when Stitch House opens, along with images of the past tenants of 829 N. Market Street.\n\nIn fact, the name Stitch House Brewery is rooted in the building's history, having formerly housed the Linen Mart and the Diamond Ice & Coal Co. ice house in the past.\n\n\"We hope to be a part of a brewing resurgence in Wilmington,\" adds Sheridan, also co-owner of Wilmington's Locale BBQ Post and the Wilmington Pickling Company.\n\nAnother alcohol-maker, Wilmington-based Civil Cider, could open as soon as this winter at the corner of North Shipley and West Fifth streets, the former home of the 4W5 Cafe.\n\nMedkeff is the man behind the Restore the King campaign, a drive to raise $100,000 to restore the 11-foot, 1,000-pound zinc King Gambrinus statue that stood at the old Diamond State Brewery.\n\nThe 135-year-old statue of the mythical European beer icon broke when it was dropped in 1978 and now Medkeff is pushing for this impressive piece of Delaware history to be fixed and put on display at the Delaware Historical Society, right next door to The Queen.\n\nAfter Diamond State was demolished to make way for I-95, the statue stood in front of the old Cohen Brothers Furniture on Madison Street. Later, it found a home in front of The King's Inn (now Harry's Savoy Grill) in Brandywine Hundred from 1963 until the early '70s. And in a neat twist, Brew-Fest performer D. Corridori is the son of the late Fran Corridori, former owner of The King's Inn.\n\nVan Horn reached out to Medkeff after learning about Restore the King and decided that a portion of Brew-Fest's proceeds will go to the restoration campaign.\n\n\"We already restored The Queen and now it's time to restore The King,\" Medkeff says. \"We joke that we want The King next to The Queen.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

And by halftime, Rutherford was speeding north in a rainstorm to his Philadelphia home to see his beloved Eagles win their first Super Bowl.\n\nThe winning brew, which will have an as-of-yet undetermined Eagles-themed name, will be among the first beers served at the North Market Street brewery, which plans to be open \"in some capacity\" in time for the city's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade on Saturday, March 10, according to co-owner Daniel Sheridan.\n\nFor months, the faces of curious passersby have been pressed against the glass looking inside as craft beer fans eagerly await what will be only the second downtown Wilmington brewery in more than six decades.\n\nThe airy 7,000-square-foot space gives Market Street a taste of what it desperately needs -- casual hang-outs for young professionals like the popular spots they regularly visit in Trolley Square and other areas of the city.\n\nWith a 30-foot bar with a zinc top, communal restaurant tables, plenty of TVs and an approachable sandwich-and-skillet menu, Stitch is gunning to be a major player at night with a promise to stay open until 1 a.m. seven nights a week -- even slow nights.\n\n\"We don't want people to guess if we're going to be open,\" says Daniel Sheridan, 35, who co-owns the vibrant 160-seat spot with fellow Wilmington native Rob Snowberger. \"It might be a little rough some nights, but I think it's better to be known as a place you know will be open.\"\n\nSheridan is also co-owner of the city's Locale BBQ Post and Wilmington Pickling Company and Snowberger's day job is vice president of development for The Buccini/Pollin Group, owner of the building at 829 N. Market St., just steps from The Grand.\n\nThey're confident that their quick, in-and-out lunches will do well thanks to downtown's hungry army of workers and they plan on hosting happy hours to bring people back for a drink or dinner. Plus, Stitch already has a few office parties already booked.\n\nThe duo isn't only targeting beer-drinking millennials with their tapas-style food, industrial decor and high-traffic location. Sunday brunches will start at 10 a.m. and a kids menu offers $7 child-size skillets such as macaroni and cheese, meatballs and pierogis.\n\nAs for adults, the menu is anchored by 10 different $10 skillet options, ranging from cheese fries and queso fundido to wings and a pepperoni \"skillet pizza.\" There are also 14 sandwiches on their sandwich board including Reubens ($13), pastrami on rye ($13), breaded chicken cutlet ($13), turkey press ($14), fried bologna ($9), along with both Cubano ($13) and short rib ($15) paninis.\n\nLarger $13 dishes include short rib stew, chicken parmesan, chicken pot pie, scallops and more. Soups and salads ($7), hamburgers ($14) and meat and cheese boards ($22-$41) are also on the menu.\n\nAnd, yes, just like Sheridan's Locale BBQ Post, there is a smoker on site for the meats.\n\nIn terms of the beer, they're still naming the brews they have already made. But among the first class of Stitch House beers to be available, there will be a lager, IPA, pilsner and stout, along with both a Belgian farmhouse and Belgian gold.\n\nCustomers will also be able to take out growlers and smaller crowlers of beer. And once the $75 million Residences at Mid-town Park apartment complex is completed on Shipley Street later this year, those residents will be able to order food and drinks to their pool deck, which will be visible from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the rear of Stitch House.\n\nThe arrival of Stitch on Market Street is actually a small piece of Delaware beer history in the making.\n\nAfter Diamond State Brewery went bankrupt in 1955, the only other downtown brewery to make its own beer was Downtown Brewing Company from 2000 to 2003. (For the record, Iron Hill Brewery, which brews its own beer, is located in the city's Riverfront area. In addition, the former Brandywine Brewing Company, which opened in 2005 on Orange Street, had its beer delivered from Greenville before closing after a short six month-run.)\n\nWhile the craft beer boom has sprouted breweries of all sizes from Greenville to Delmar, it has left downtown Wilmington untouched over the past 15 years.\n\nThe city had long been the state's brewing center thanks to breweries such as Hartmann & Fehrenbach, which opened in the 1860s, along with others such as the Joseph Stoeckle Brewing Company, Diamond State Brewery and Bavarian Brewery.\n\nThe opening of Stitch will come two years after the death of the man who was supposed to be the one opening a brewery at the location.\n\nIt was February 2016 when Chelsea Tavern and Ernest & Scott Taproom owner Scott Morrison died at the age of 54. Restaurateur Joe Van Horn and a partner have since purchased those two restaurants while Sheridan and Snowberger stepped in to replace Morrison in the brewery project.\n\nSheridan says even though Snowberger is an executive for building owner BGP, it's their restaurant.\n\n\"This is no longer really a BPG project -- they are our landlords,\" says Sheridan, also a chef who has cooked at local restaurants such as Cantwell's Tavern, Hotel du Pont, Big Fish, La Fia and more over the years.\n\nMartin Hageman, executive director of the city's nonprofit business group Downtown Visions, says Stitch House is what downtown needs and hints that more businesses targeting young professionals are coming soon.\n\nHe says about 200 people lived in downtown Wilmington five years ago, a number that now stands at an estimated 2,000.\n\n\"We can't only have white tablecloth-type dining. There's demand for less-expensive and more personal options,\" Hageman says of Stitch House, whose name is rooted in the building's history, having formerly housed Linen Mart and the Diamond Ice & Coal Co. in the past. \"A lot of the younger millennials want the socialization that Stitch House and other places will be providing.\"\n\nWith a pair of owners in their mid-30s, Sheridan thinks they know what the younger, nightlife-seeking crowds want.\n\nAnd that's exactly what BPG wants to keep younger residents moving to downtown to fill their still-growing roster of apartment buildings that dot downtown.\n\n\"We are the actual demographic and when my friends get off work, they don't necessarily want to sit down for a full meal. You want to be lounging with food on the cheaper side,\" Sheridan says. \"Even though this space is beautiful, the aim is not to get lost pretentiousness. We want to be a hangout.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

(We have one-day delivery now, but same-day is still out of reach.)\n\nSince we still want a rap fest, Amazon same-day and Wawa (or, even better, a deli with proper breakfast sandwiches and bagels), we're holding those over for this new wish list.\n\nWe also brainstormed new ideas in the newsroom, asked readers for what they wanted and came up with more suggestions as Wilmington continues its march toward becoming a more livable city.\n\nHere are some of the ideas that rose to the top:\n\n-- Rooftop restaurant/bar with a view. Wilmington has all these big buildings with rooftops and they are almost never used for anything fun. We have to go back to 2010 when Trombone Shorty played a Light Up the Queen Foundation fundraiser atop the ShopRite of Christina Crossing parking garage for a great Wilmington rooftop memory. This city has views. Why not let us see them? One reason might be neighbors. A rooftop party scheduled for the Colonial Parking Garage at 12th and N. Orange streets in 2016 never happened after Midtown Brandywine residents complained about possible noise. Even so, city views on summer nights (or even winter evenings in heated domes) would sure scratch an itch.\n\n-- Grocery store. When it comes to major supermarkets in the city, there's Trolley Square's Acme, The Fresh Grocer of Adams Plaza on Fourth Street or the newer ShopRite of Christiana Crossing near the Riverfront. Yet there are still plenty of residents who hop in their car and head north to Concord Pike for higher-end supermarket experiences at Trader Joe's, Wegmans and Whole Foods. Could one of those stores survive in the heart of Wilmington? Perhaps something the size of Trader Joe's on the Riverfront or in the Trolley Square area if you can somehow find space.\n\n-- Pedal boats, kayaks and more. Fort Christina was built in what is now Wilmington by the Swedish in 1638, drawn by the confluence of the Brandywine and Christina rivers. These days, the river is almost an afterthought. When it comes to easy fun on the Christina River, which snakes along the Riverfront, it's generally limited to rides on the Riverfront Wilmington River Taxi or dinner cruises on The Riverboat Queen. You can also row with the help of the Wilmington Rowing Center. Perhaps it should be easier to get out there with pedal boat, kayak, canoe and paddleboard rentals? And while the former Up the Creek restaurant used to have a 680-foot floating dock, there's nothing like that left now. A reader proposed a new marina near a Riverfront business.\n\n-- Riverfront pool. If getting too close to the bacteria and other pollutants that can be found in the Christina River isn't your thing, but you still want to get wet in the summer, how about a large pool along the Riverfront? It's would be the closest thing we have to a beach and we can envision families with children and young professionals alike being drawn to a pool. In fact, there's a reason why Buccini/Pollin Group has made sure there's an outdoor pool at their new Residences at Mid-town Park luxury apartments-- it's an amenity that the city's younger workforce really want.\n\n-- Casual downtown hangs/all-age club. The business culture that dominates downtown Wilmington by day still leaves its mark at night. The restaurants that cater to the biz lunch crowd try to morph into more casual bars at night, but in the end, they're still just gastropubs. Downtown needs more places like hard-to-find Nomad Bar on Orange Street, which offers only original music and booze to one of the most diverse bar crowds in the city. Maybe an even smaller indie place with music for all ages, a BYOB license and cheap pizza slices could work. Local acts could use another spot to perform for a chill crowd in a more underground setting. Bonus: Could double as a comedy club.\n\n-- Bowling alley. In 2015, readers reacted to our wish list with suggestions of their own. And many wanted a bowling alley. If you've been envisioning a bowling alley in Wilmington, you're not alone. How about a cross between Rehoboth Beach's Lefty's Alley & Eats and Philadelphia's Lucky Strike? It could incorporate a club atmosphere at night with a bar and better food than hot dogs and popcorn. AMF Price Lanes in Prices Corner and First State Lanes near Edgemoor shouldn't be our only options in this era of high-end bowling alleys.\n\n-- Nightclub. If you remember the crowds that went to Kahunaville and The Big Kahuna on the Riverfront in the late '90s and early '00s, you know what's possible. Look at the big summertime crowds that flock to FireStone Roasting House, which, along with Lavish and Celebrations on Market, is the closest thing to a full-scale club in town. Or take a look at what The Queen is doing. For dance party shows like last week's Biz Markie DJ set or the upcoming Royal Nightclub show, the doors stay open late -- until 12:30 or even 1 a.m. They're keeping large crowds out until last call -- something that almost never happened under World Cafe Live.\n\n-- Weekend trolley. Even in a world where Uber and Lyft are at just about everyone's fingertips, does downtown, the Riverfront and Trolley Square need to be better connected? If city officials envision creating a truly bustling city, perhaps something between the boozy Jolly Trolley at the beach and the more staid tours of the Wilmington Trolley Company would work on Thursday through Sunday nights. If promoted and cheap enough, it could become part of the city's entertainment/food culture, especially if patrons can track the trolley on their phone. Sure, ideas like this have come and gone in Wilmington before, but maybe it could work in the future. And if we want to really go for it, check out what's available in the world of pedal bars, including the one in Nashville. It's a pedal-powered open-air vehicle with bar stools and coolers for a BYOB experience on the road.\n\n-- More inventive bars and restaurants. As one reader put it, \"Not everything needs to be Trolley Square Oyster House.\" Or Trolley Tap House. Or Kelly's Logan House. Or Firestone Roasting House. On the city's west side, the independently-owned arcade/bar 1984 offers tons of games and live music paired with craft beer, while fellow indie Oddity Bar has oddities such as taxidermied animals and cult films playing on its TVs. Not far away is the Crimson Moon, still waving the flag as New Castle County's only gay bar. The restaurant groups that dominate the scene tend to play it safe. You can almost get the same look, same food and same drinks no matter where you go. Does every meal have to be a sandwich with a small pail of French fries next to it? There's a reason Wilmingtonians don't live in the suburbs, so there's no need to import its boring fare. Start new traditions, bring in new ideas and give customers a real reason to come back.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Eisenhower was president, Bill Haley & His Comets had a hit with \"Rock Around the Clock\" and I-95 didn't yet split the city in two.\n\nIt was 1954 when the Diamond State Brewery on Fifth Street closed for good and eventually was demolished, clearing space for the interstate.\n\nSTORY: After 23 years, Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale finally gets six-packs\n\nSTORY: 21 fresh fall and pumpkin beers from Delaware breweries\n\nSTORY: Q&A: Seeking grace, Billy Corgan becomes Mr. Nice Guy\n\nThis spring – 64 years after Diamond State died – a new production microbrewery called Wilmington Brew Works will open on Miller Road at the long-dormant former site of the Harper-Thiel Electroplating Co., a restored brownfield.\n\nFresh beer in the tasting room, live music and perhaps a restaurant are expected to fill the 2.3-acre site, which will retain its iconic Spanish colonial-style look and red tile roof.\n\nWhile you won't see a bottling machine like Diamond State Brewery had when it produced 130,000 barrels a year, Wilmington Brew Works will be canning its 500 barrels of beer a year in a portion of the 11,000-square-foot building. The brews will be on draft at the brewery and the cans are expected to eventually be available at liquor stores and restaurants.\n\n\"It's going to be a whole new beer scene for Delaware,\" says Wilmington Brew Works owner/brewer Craig Wensell, formerly of Bellefonte Brewing Co. \"We're going to make a little history for Wilmington.\n\n\"One of the things that shocked me and all of my friends in the brewing industry is just that statement. What major city in the United States can you go to now and say we're the first [production] brewery in the city limits in 60 years? There's no city left where that's the case.\"\n\nIn the half-century since Diamond State's demise, a few breweries have come and gone within the city limits with Iron Hill Brewery now standing as the city's lone brewery. Another newcomer, Stitch House Brewery, is expected to open sometime later this year on Market Street near The Grand, adding to the city's locally-sourced offerings.\n\nIn late 2015, the Wilmington Urban Development Action Grant Corp., a quasi-governmental agency that holds abandoned brownfield projects while they are cleaned up, sold the property for $240,000 to Ralph and Rose Pepe.\n\nThe Talleyville couple also owns the 57,000-square-foot retail center Talleyville Towne Shoppes at Concord Pike and Silverside Road, along with Concord Pike Liquors.\n\nThe Pepes are leasing space to Wilmington Brew Works and are currently accepting inquiries from prospective restaurant partners, eyeing an eatery to complement the brewery. A food hall — a more modern, upscale reincarnation of the food court — could also fit, he says.\n\nPatrons will be able to drink on an outdoor front patio, taking in a view of Haynes Park and listening to atmospheric live music, says Wensell, a former music professor and high school music teacher who founded his old brewery, Bellefonte Brewing Co., in his Bellefonte home as a brewing supply business in 2014.\n\nFrom the street, passersby will see the stainless steel fermentation tanks in the front windows. Located in an area of the city with little to no nightlife or restaurants, this desert is about to get an oasis — a beer-filled oasis.\n\nThe Northern Delaware Greenway Trail, used both by bikers and for nature walks, passes right by the brewery and Wensell hopes the brewery will become a pit stop for its users.\n\nIt's worked down at the beach.\n\nRevelation Craft Brewing Co. in Rehoboth Beach is located on the Junction and Breakwater Trail and often you'll see more bikes than cars out front. Revelation even sells their beer in \"Browlers,\" a trademarked beer growler made to fit inside a bicycle's water bottle holder.\n\n\"Places like this is something I would want in my neighborhood. It's a place a lot of Gen X'ers and Millennials would want,\" says Wensell, 42, who will offer everything from IPAs and lagers to stouts and barrel-aged sours from the brewery's horseshoe-shaped bar. \"The whole point of this project is to make fantastic beer, create great atmosphere to enjoy the beer and to be able to add to the community.\"\n\nIt's fitting that Wensell will be making Wilmington beer history when he fires up his canning line for the first time. The site is already rich with history.\n\nConstructed in 1916, the space was used by Francis Irénée du Pont as an experimental laboratory. It's believed that inside the building — initially registered under the name The Delaware Chemical Engineering Co. — smokeless gunpowder was developed.\n\nIn 1946, the site was sold to Harry Thiel and his wife, who established the Harper-Thiel Electroplating Co. Harper-Thiel closed in 2000 and has remained vacant ever since due to contaminants in the ground.\n\nThe contamination was remediated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources, which spent about $3 million during the last 15 years to make it safe. The process included excavating 3,600 tons of contaminated soil and removing about 100 barrels of chemicals that were left on the property from its electroplating days.\n\nThe special attention to the site's soil continued when the Pepes began developing the property with specialized workers and monitors on site to ensure its safety. His workers didn't hit any contaminated soil while digging to install a new drainage system, but they did find massive boulders they needed to break up.\n\nIt's exactly that time and effort that made it hard to find a buyer for the Harper-Thiel site in the first place.\n\nAt the time of purchase, Pepe told The News Journal that the estimated cost of the project would be $1.5 million, but now says, \"It will be much more than that.\"\n\n\"Why did I do it? Sometimes I ask that question myself,\" he says with a chuckle. \"But I'm really happy with the way it turned out. I think it's not only going to be an asset for the community, it's going to be a treasure.\"\n\nEven though he knew the project on the restored brownfield could be fraught with potential hazards (financial and otherwise), Pepe says he has long eyed the location.\n\n\"I always thought it had a lot of potential and it certainly would have been easier to just knock it down and build something else,\" he says. \"I really thought the building should be restored.\"\n\nThe city also has been assisting the Pepes with the project, funding street improvements on Miller Road and adding a sidewalk to make the area more walkable. There will be a parking lot in the rear with around 100 parking spaces, along with a few spots out front.\n\nWhen completed, Mayor Mike Purzycki believes the complex will give the Ninth Ward a needed boost.\n\n\"That side of town could use a real positive statement from an investor/operator and it sounds like a perfect solution to energizing the commercial district there,\" he says. \"Places like breweries are destinations. If you're good at what you do, they'll get in the car and find you.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Think of it as a half-sized can version of a full-size growler -- the take-out 64-ounce beer jugs that have been available for years.\n\nIt was in late 2013 when Colorado-based Oskar Blues Brewery first debuted a table-top seaming machine to can beers at a local taproom.\n\nIt didn't take long for the idea to foment interest.\n\nSTORY: Ha! 7 comedians to battle in Wilmington Friday\n\nSTORY: It's party time at The Delaware Contemporary\n\nSTORY: Wilmington native competing on 'RuPaul's Drag Race'\n\nIn the years since, Crowlers have slowly begun popping up across the country, including in Delaware where they can be purchased from upstate spots such as The Delaware Growler and the Stone Balloon Ale House, both in Newark, to downstate watering holes Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats in Rehoboth Beach and Crooked Hammock Brewery near Lewes. The Burley Oak Brewing Company in Berlin, Maryland, also has the quick-sealing technology.\n\nWhile can supplier Ball Packaging holds the trademark for the Crowler, which actually refers to the can itself, Oskar Blues is the exclusive dealer of the original machine used to seal their cans. Other Crowler canning machines have made their way onto the market as well, including one from Dixie Canner Co.\n\nPike Creek beer drinker Lindsey Timberman remembers the first time she saw a Crowler a couple of years ago at Pizza Boy Brewing Co. near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She and her husband, Eric, just had to buy one and they ended up keeping it for two to three months. When it was time to drink, it tasted as fresh as the day it was poured.\n\nShe now stops into The Delaware Growler to pick them up every so often, drawn to the size and longtime freshness.\n\n\"I remember the first time we saw them do it. They just filled it up, get the top on, put it in this little wheel thing and the next thing you know you have this big can of beer,\" says Timberman, publisher of Delaware Hop Scene, an online Delaware beer news source. \"I just love the concept of an instant can.\"\n\nWhile Crooked Hammock was the state's first spot to add Crowlers back in October 2015, The Delaware Growler on Newark's Main Street, opened by Mike Slattery and his wife, Andrea, was not far behind.\n\nThis week marks the one-year anniversary of the Crowler's arrival in the heart of the University of Delaware's campus after Slattery plunked down several thousand dollars for the machine.\n\nHe estimates he's sold more than 3,000 Crowlers, goosing his annual sales partly because buyers of his glass growlers usually take home a Crowler or two as well.\n\nHis pours range from $8.99 to $19.99 depending on which of the 50 draft beers that customers choose. The average cost is around $10 with a $1 fee for the recyclable Crowler can.\n\nSlattery has enjoyed firsthand the near-amazement on the faces of beer drinkers who see a Crowler being sealed for the first time -- a process that takes seconds. And then comes the realization of the possibilities, like having fresh draft beer in your home refrigerator that will stay fresh for months. From the moment he writes the name of the beer on the label to the time the can is sealed and ready for the customer, the entire process takes just under one minute.\n\n\"It's been incredible. It brings people into the store. I get calls about them,\" says Slattery, who first came across the cans via brewery representatives bringing fresh beers for him to sample.\n\nCrowlers made their debut at Dogfish's brewpub on Rehoboth Avenue in August and were an attention-getting addition. While sales have been incrementally better as more people become familiar with the giant cans, the wow factor was immediate.\n\n\"We placed it strategically front and center right behind our bar so it's a showpiece,\" says Ryan Schwamberger, general manager of Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats. \"When you fill one up, there are so many people staring at it curiously, like they're thinking, 'What the hell is that?'\"\n\n\"It's a great marketing tool, too. Sometimes, I'll just fill up a beer and Crowl it off just to spike interest of the people sitting around the bar. It immediately sparks a conversation.\"\n\nDogfish's Milton brewery is due to have one installed in June and more are on the way in the state. New breweries and cideries are planning on joining the trend. A pair of not-yet-open Wilmington spots -- the Stitch House Brewery on Market Street across from The Grand and Civil Cider at Fifth and Shipley streets -- will have Crowlers, according to owners.\n\nDan Sheridan, owner of Stitch House Brewery, which plans to open in October, first saw a Crowler during a visit to West Chester, Pennsylvania's Levante Brewing Company a couple of weeks ago.\n\n\"I thought it was incredible. I bought a couple for home and they work so much better than growlers in some instances,\" says Sheridan, who is also behind Wilmington's Locale BBQ Post and Wilmington Pickling Company.\n\nEven after seeing the cost of the machines, which generally range from $3,000 to $8,000, Sheridan was sold just like other brewery and bar owners in the state over the past year or so: \"I think it's kind of a no-brainer for us to drop that kind money for something like that. It's a thing now.\"\n\nAnd since states like Delaware allow on-site packaging of to-go beer as long as it's sealed at properly licensed establishments, no new laws needed to be passed to add Crowlers to the state's beer offerings.\n\nSays John Cordrey, head of the Office of the Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commissioner: \"As long as it's capped, that's OK.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Ninth Street when it opens Monday, April 2.\n\nPart of a $75 million luxury apartment complex known as The Residences at Mid-town Park at 820 N. Orange St., the parking garage will be known as Mid-town Park Garage with 511 parking spots in what will be the city's first underground garage. Located 50 feet below street-level, the garage will be operated by Chicago-based parking company SP+.\n\nThe 200 apartments above will be housed in two buildings -- five and nine stories tall -- with pre-leasing beginning April 2 and move-in starting May 28. The studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments will range from $1,050 to $2,000, according to officials with the Wilmington-based real estate company.\n\nA pedestrian bridge will connect the two buildings, which is outfitted with everything from a large outdoor pool and dog-washing stations to a game room and a demonstration kitchen. About 12,000 square feet of retail space is on the street level.\n\nAfter years of dusty construction in the area, along with intermittent road closures, one of downtown's biggest projects is near completion, giving downtown visitors a new secure and stable parking alternative.\n\nTo start, BPG will offer $1 parking at the lot with validation if you visit a downtown restaurant or entertainment venue, according to Chris Buccini, co-president of the firm. (Normal rates range from $5 for the first hour to $14 for 24 hours. There's a post-5 p.m. night rate of $4 and $150 monthly parking passes will be available.)\n\n\"Even though there's plenty of on-street parking on any given night, but people want dependability,\" Buccini says. \"This is the new and improved version of the old go-to.\"\n\nBut it's not just the garage and apartment complex coming online in downtown that has business owners and residents excited.\n\nThe small walkway that connected N. Market Street to Shipley Street across from The Grand near Chelsea Tavern is being blown out to create an expansive common area.\n\nDubbed Chelsea Plaza, it will not only open up the somewhat claustrophobic canyon known as Market Street, but will also allow customers of Chelsea Tavern and UDairy to eat dinner or grab a beer under the stars.\n\nThe space will be opened next month, creating an open path between Eighth and Ninth streets that stretches from The Residences at Mid-town Park to the government buildings on French Street.\n\n\"You're going to be able to come out of that garage and see the front of The Grand. It's just going to be so convenient,\" Fields says. \"The optics are going to be great.\"\n\nAt the same time, a pair of new restaurants are preparing to open on N. Market Street.\n\nItalian spot Arde Osteria at 629 N. Market St., owned by the team behind nearby Dimeo's Pizza, and Margaux, a restaurant with its own on-site bakery and crêperie at 902 N. Market St., are both nearing opening dates this spring.\n\nAt the same time, work continues a few blocks away at Wilmington's DuPont Building where the $3.5 million DE.CO food hall project will open later this year at 10th and Orange streets.\n\nIf you were at the opening of Stitch House Brewery last weekend, located on Market Street across from The Grand, you got a taste of what BPG is hoping for.\n\nLarge, steady crowds were drawn to what is only the second downtown Wilmington brewery in more than six decades with young professionals and families mingling at communal tables. On one soft opening date, they even ran out of food.\n\n\"We're trying to do more of that,\" Buccini says of adding more casual, relaxed bars and restaurants like those found in Trolley Square.\n\nAbove the brewery are seven apartments known as 829MKT, which will be available starting April 1, ranging from studios and one-bedrooms to large open loft-style units ranging $734 to $1643. (Sorry beer fans, there's no fireman's pole connecting the brewery to the apartments above.)\n\nBuccini says the goal behind all of the development is to give residents everything they would want in a small city with hopes of drawing a total of 5,000 residents to downtown. They have more than 2,000 now after BPG opened three new residential buildings over the past year.\n\n\"We're going to keep building one to three residential buildings every year,\" Buccini says.\n\nWith restaurants, theaters, beer gardens, an IMAX movie theater and a mix of retail shops, they're betting that they can change the longtime trend of young professionals moving to the city's Trolley Square area after getting their first post-college job.\n\nThe site of the new parking garage isn't just a spot to drop off your car, but also holds a piece of civil rights history that ended up being settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMid-town Parking Center was the home to the Eagle Coffee Shoppe. When the shop denied service in 1958 to then-Wilmington City Councilman William H. \"Dutch\" Burton, the shop and the building owners, Wilmington Parking Authority, were sued by famed Wilmington civil rights attorney Louis L. Redding. In the end, the Supreme Court sided with Burton and Redding.\n\nIn a nod to that history, a new road between the two Mid-town Park buildings will be named Burton Place, giving access to the parking garage.\n\nFields says The Grand will begin promoting the resurrection of Mid-town Park Garage to its customers soon.\n\nThe Grand's MyChoice series subscribers -- fans who purchase tickets to three or more shows -- receive free parking with their purchases. And for the '18-'19 season, patrons will be able to choose Mid-town as their garage in addition to the two other garages currently being offered.\n\nForrest Friedman, regional manager for SP+, says customers will be able to reserve spots online and pay at walk-up stations or at the exit.\n\nOh -- and that past problem of the old parking garage being locked, stranding customers?\n\nFriedman says those days are over: \"We'll be open 24/7.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The hall will be open daily and will serve weekend brunches. The atrium bar will be open evenings.\n\nIt will have 250 seats and a private event space. The $3.5-million project is a collaboration between Wilmington's The Buccini/Pollin Group and Seawall Development, a company that developed Baltimore’s food hall, R. House.\n\nWho are the chefs? That's the $1 million question – and no one is saying. Yet.

His frustration led to several outbursts through last spring and summer, Luke said.\n\nBut as Kellen adjusted, Luke started noticing behavioral changes with her eldest child, Talia, 11, last fall. Her school pivoted back and forth between virtual and in-person learning last year.\n\nTalia, who has always loved school and was outgoing, was getting distracted during her virtual lessons. Her ability to stay focused on the classwork, her inability to get her teacher’s attention over a chorus of other children speaking throughout the virtual lesson, started to affect her. Grades became an issue and her anxiety grew.\n\n“I know Talia is not alone and there are so many kids that are struggling right now,” said Luke. “I’m always hearing from other parents who have seen their kid’s anxiety and depression go through the roof. It’s obvious how much this has affected them.”\n\nHer children returned to school this monthin Jefferson Parish, along with thousands of other young students across Louisiana. The start of this school year coincides with a steady increase in COVID-19 cases linked to the delta variant, which has affected greater numbers of young people and children.\n\nIt’s a source of concern for many parents like Luke, even as they hold out hope that this year will bear some semblance of normalcy for their children.\n\n“It’s just an extra level of anxiety to contend with while at the same time I’m hoping they stay healthy and are able to get back to their routines,” she said.\n\nThe pandemic has created a significant disruption in the lives of school-age children and teenagers, who have had to adjust to interrupted routines, a loss of community, and greater social isolation. Public health measures have intermittently forced the closure of schools, summer camps, and other settings that help children with socialization and learning. Children and teenagers have also had to cope with the loss of loved ones and the financial struggles that have affected hundreds of families during the pandemic. As a new year begins, school districts across the state are looking at ways to address the emotional and social needs of their students that have been amplified by the pandemic, while at the same time trying to manage limited resources and professionals able to handle those needs.\n\n'Considerable' federal spending on mental health support for children\n\nLouisiana schools were recently notified they would be receiving federal aid through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), which in part has to be used to provide mental health services and address learning loss. The nearly $4 billion fund will be disbursed in segments over the next three years to school districts.\n\nWith these funds, several districts across the state are better able to manage their counseling shortages and hire mental health professionals. Some districts are adding to their rosters of in-house social workers and licensed counselors with the help of federal COVID relief funds. St. Landry Parish has implemented a Well-Being Leadership Team at each campus, which is made up of at least one teacher, counselor, and administrator from each school.\n\nThe Lafayette Parish School System in southwest Louisiana is using more than a quarter of a million dollars toward six full-time school counselors to provide individual and group therapy, agency referrals, mental health screening and intervention support for LPSS students as recommended by school staff, according to district documents.\n\nOuachita Parish Schools in Northeast Louisiana will have three full-time mental health experts and 12-15 part-time mental health staff, as announced by the district’s superintendent, Don Coker.\n\nSchools also are adjusting curriculum and providing social-emotional training for staff to be able to reach out to all children and expand the reach of the traditional mental health support already on school campuses.\n\nAt Leonville Elementary, each school day last year began with a “morning meeting” to check on students.\n\n“We check in with them and see if they’re not in an OK space,” Principal Nicole Morrison said. \"We always had some social and emotional supports on campus, but what the pandemic did was exacerbate it. Now everyone is affected.”\n\nAnd when families need support beyond school, districts are partnering with outside agencies to provide services. Healing House in Lafayette has been providing grief support groups in local schools. as well as tragedy response teams and coping kits.\n\nThey can meet at schools, usually during lunch breaks, or for longer sessions at “the house,” which includes four rooms designed to help kids open up and work through their grief.\n\n\"We knew there were a number of kids whose families couldn't physically get them to Healing House,” Program Director Brad Gros said. “We wanted to make sure we were serving as many kids as possible. School counselors have so much on their plate; they are happy to have an added resource come in and help make sure students' needs are met.”\n\nState officials expect to see similar moves across more districts, as billions in ESSER dollars filter down to school systems over the next few years.\n\n\"The well-being of kids really matters to us, and we are trying to provide resources for mental health supports,\" Louisiana Superintendent Cade Brumley said. \"I do expect quite considerable (federal) spending in those areas considering the trauma of COVID-19.\"\n\n'Teenagers are internalizing problems'\n\nStudies show that public health mandates, such as distance learning, school closures and altered schedules, have resulted in a higher incidence of anxiety and depression among older children and teenagers.\n\nSchool started Aug. 9 in Plaquemines Parish, where staff and students are required to mask on school buses and on campus.\n\nFor now, school will be entirely in person. To reduce the spread of COVID, the district offered both virtual and in-person school options last year.\n\nSuch changes in school schedules led to different reactions in different developmental age groups, according to Brandon Wilks, a nationally certified school psychologist who works with the Plaquemines Parish School District and the president of the Louisiana School Psychological Association.\n\nMiddle and high school students who were accustomed to using computers were able to bounce back more easily academically, while younger children struggled with basic fundamentals, especially during virtual classes, he said.\n\n“We had a lot more externalizing behavior among younger kids than expected. Kids becoming more aggressive with each other and having trouble verbalizing what was going on with them,” said Wilks. “The pandemic took away opportunities to practice socialization.”\n\nAmong older students, he has seen the opposite.\n\n“Teenagers are internalizing problems, resulting in more anxiety and depression,” he said.\n\nIt’s a troubling pattern that has been reported across the country. A national poll conducted by the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Michigan reported that 46% of parents said their teenagers were showing signs of new or worsening mental health conditions since March 2020. The report is based on responses from 977 parents of teenagers ages 13-18.\n\nAmong younger children, experts are concerned about the loss of socialization and communication skills, which can result in outbursts, aggression, and other signs of pent-up stress.\n\nThrough the CARES Act, the district was able to access funding to help students and families dealing with food insecurity by providing free meals. The district also put in place screening methods to identify students who may be struggling at school or with circumstances at home.\n\n“We have become more acutely aware of the financial situation and trauma history our kids are dealing with,” said Wilks.\n\nStudents' social interactions have been limited\n\nSimone McCrocklin, an art teacher with the Talented Visual Arts Program in the Lafayette Parish School System, worries about how the over-exposure to technology has affected her students and her 11-year-old daughter Sophia over the last 16 months.\n\nWhile Sophia was able to go to school in person most of last year, her summer camp was canceled for the second year in a row, limiting her ability to socialize with other kids during the summer months.\n\n“She has regressed when it comes to social interactions with other people and kids. It has been a struggle to get her off technology to come to talk to us or run errands,” said McCrocklin.\n\nAmong her high school students, she has seen similar troublesome signs. A lack of interest in engaging in face-to-face conversations and students relying more on friends they meet online.\n\n“Everyone has become so dependent on technology and it really has been exacerbated by the pandemic. You couldn’t go anywhere and screens were the only way to communicate.”\n\nKelly Harper, a social worker for West Carroll Parish, said many students lost their only chance for positive interaction when they couldn’t come to school due to COVID-19. At home, some students struggled with troubled families or saw no family at all.\n\n“Teacher-student relationships are very important because that teacher might be the only person that that child has a positive interaction with on a daily basis,” Harper said. “When the students got sent home and they were either home doing virtual school or no school at all, a lot of our students were no longer having that positive interaction with our teachers or with the school administration.”\n\nDeborah Evans, curriculum coordinator and master teacher for West Carroll Parish, said she has watched several children experience the death of close family members, causing additional strain upon pandemic woes.\n\nEvans knew one family who lost their grandfather. He would pick up and drop off his grandson who was in the third grade and granddaughter who was in second grade every day. He’d bring them food from McDonald’s, and check to make sure his grandson never forgot his math book. On occasion, he would bring fishing poles and take them to the water.\n\nEvans said the grandson was most affected, because not only did he lose a grandparent, but a male figure in his life.\n\n“Elementary children, they don't know how to respond. They don't know how to grieve,” Evans said. “Those are learned behaviors.”\n\nThe school counseling shortage isn't new\n\nSchool districts have struggled for years to staff their schools with mental health professionals prior to the pandemic.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services projected significant shortages for behavioral health practitioners for children and adolescents, especially in schools, according to Louisiana State University.\n\nThere were 561 social workers employed by local education agencies across the state of Louisiana, amounting to about half (52.2%) of the mental health workforce in schools during the 2018-2019 school year, according to the Louisiana Department of Education.\n\nWith 716,293 students enrolled in Louisiana public schools at the time, this indicated a 1,277:1 student-to-social worker ratio — more than five times the 250:1 ratio recommended by the National Association of Social Workers, according to LSU.\n\nIn West Carroll Parish, there are only four counselors able to help the district’s more than 2,000 students and five schools. The district has had a shortage of these professionals for the last five to seven years, according to Harper.\n\nBecause the parish is small and rural staff members are asked to wear multiple hats. Harper provides counseling services as a social worker and conducts special education assessments of pre-schoolers in between traveling to different campuses.\n\n“We all have tons of job duties,” Harper said. “So our time to actually provide counseling, direct counseling services to students is limited because of our staffing shortage.\"\n\nNearby district Ouachita Parish Schools has experienced similar issues. Aswell Werner, director of middle schools and Title II for the district, said they can hire only so many counselors. After three to four counselors retired this year due to COVID-19 concerns, the district had trouble finding replacements. Werner said many licensed practitioners, who usually provide private counseling, are not always eligible for their school positions because they require employees to be certified to work in a school setting.\n\nDespite these counselor shortages, the demand is there. The counselors who are around to help are doing what they can. In West Carroll, the district plans to put together social, emotional learning teams of up to six staff members to address mental and behavioral needs in students.\n\n“An actual teacher at the school or the assistant principal or the cafeteria worker or the janitor at each school — they tend to know their students better than anyone else,” Harper said. “I feel like it'll be a more personalized assessment and interventions that can be provided by the staff members who know the students and other families a little bit better than what we did at the district level.”\n\nThese teams will have monthly meetings, and they will discuss students who are considered at risk by assessing grades and behavioral concerns. Parents will also be invited to partake in the process.\n\n'It's scary being a teacher'\n\nAs schools work to address the needs of their students they will also be working to address the mental health needs of staff who have had to work under extraordinary circumstances and pressure for close to two years, including a partnership between the Louisiana Department of Education and Ochsner Health System to provide free teletherapy to school employees.\n\n“It's scary being a teacher or coming back to the uncertainty of everything, and we have to try to make sure that the mental health of our staff is supported as well,” said Harper.\n\nIn addition to teachers feeling the stress and grief of the pandemic, teachers are under pressure to make sure their students perform well in school. When looking at the most recent LEAP scores, student performance level decreased across all districts in all grade levels with the exception of two school districts. With the new school year, much of the conversation is centered around how schools are going to recoup lost learning and ensure students perform better on next year’s standardized tests.\n\n\"The concern that many people have had is that when kids come back (to school) they may be under stress to perform, teachers may be under stress to perform, it could create an emotional tinderbox that could be really problematic,” said David Osher, the vice president and institute fellow at the American Institutes for Research.\n\nContact the reporters: Maria Clark at mclark@gannett.com or on Twitter @MariaPClark1; Leigh Guidry at Lguidry@theadvertiser.com or @LeighGGuidry; and Sabrina LeBoeuf at sleboeuf@gannett.com or @_sabrinakaye.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/31/schools-tap-vague-rules-to-suspend-students/72949597007/", "title": "Vague school rules at the root of millions of student suspensions", "text": "Sarah Butrymowicz, Fazil Khan and Meredith Kolodner\n\nThe Hechinger Report\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: This story from The Hechinger Report has been updated to clarify Johanna Lacoe's title. She is the research director of the California Policy Lab's site at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nA Rhode Island student smashed a ketchup packet with his fist, splattering an administrator. Another ripped up his school work. The district called it “destruction of school property.” A Washington student turned cartwheels while a PE teacher attempted to give instructions.\n\nA pair of Colorado students slid down a dirt path despite a warning. An Ohio 12th grader refused to work while assigned to the in-school suspension room. Then there was the Maryland sixth grader who swore when his computer shut off and responded “my bad” when his teacher addressed his language.\n\nTheir transgressions all ended the same way: The students were suspended.\n\nDiscipline records state the justification for their removals: These students were disorderly. Insubordinate. Disruptive. Disobedient. Defiant. Disrespectful.\n\nAt most U.S. public schools, students can be suspended, even expelled, for these ambiguous and highly subjective reasons. This type of punishment is pervasive nationwide, leading to hundreds of thousands of missed days of school every year, and is often doled out for misbehavior that doesn’t seriously hurt anyone or threaten school safety, a Hechinger Report investigation found.\n\nDistricts cited one of these vague violations as a reason for suspending or expelling students more than 2.8 million times from 2017-18 to 2021-22 across the 20 states that collect this data. That amounted to nearly a third of all punishments recorded by those states. Black students and students with disabilities were more likely than their peers to be disciplined for these reasons.\n\nBecause categories like defiance and disorderly conduct are often defined broadly at the state level, teachers and administrators have wide latitude in interpreting them, according to interviews with dozens of researchers, educators, lawyers and discipline reform advocates. That opens the door to suspensions for low-level infractions.\n\n“Those are citations you can drive a truck through,” said Jennifer Wood, executive director for the Rhode Island Center for Justice.\n\nThe Hechinger Report also obtained more than 7,000 discipline records from a dozen school districts across eight states through public records requests. They show a wide range of behavior that led to suspensions for things like disruptive conduct and insubordination. Much of the conduct posed little threat to safety. For instance, students were regularly suspended for being tardy, using a phone during class or swearing.\n\nTeachers need other tools to address behavior\n\nDecades of research have found that students who are suspended from school tend to perform worse academically and drop out at higher rates. Researchers have linked suspensions to lower college enrollment rates and increased involvement with the criminal justice system.\n\nThese findings have spurred some policymakers to try to curtail suspensions by limiting their use to severe misbehavior that could harm others. Last year, California banned all suspensions for willful defiance. Other places, including Philadelphia and New York City, have similarly eliminated suspensions for low-level misconduct.\n\nElsewhere, though, as student behavior has worsened following the pandemic, legislators are calling for stricter discipline policies, concerned for educators who struggle to maintain order and students whose lessons are disrupted. These legislative proposals come despite warnings from experts and even classroom teachers who say more suspensions – particularly for minor, subjective offenses – are not the answer.\n\nRoberto J. Rodríguez, assistant U.S. education secretary, said he was concerned by The Hechinger Report’s findings. “We need more tools in the toolkit for our educators and for our principals to be able to respond to some of the social and emotional needs,” he said. “Suspension and expulsion shouldn’t be the only tool that we pull out when we see behavioral issues.”\n\nIn Rhode Island, insubordination was the most common reason for a student to be suspended in the years analyzed. Disorderly conduct was third.\n\nIn the Cranston Public Schools, these two categories accounted for half of the Rhode Island district’s suspensions in 2021-22. Disorderly conduct alone made up about 38%.\n\nBehavior that led to a such a suspension there in recent years included:\n\nGetting a haircut in the bathroom;\n\nPutting a finger through the middle of another student’s hamburger at lunch;\n\nWriting swear words in an email exchange with another student;\n\nThrowing cut up pieces of paper in the air;\n\nStabbing a juice bottle with a pencil and getting juice all over a table and peers; and\n\nLeapfrogging over a peer and “almost” knocking down others.\n\nCranston school officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nRhode Island Department of Education spokesperson Victor Morente said in an email that the agency could not comment on specific causes for suspension, but that the department “continues to underscore that all options need to be exhausted before schools move to suspension.”\n\nThe department defines disorderly conduct as “Any act which substantially disrupts the orderly conduct of a school function, (or) behavior which substantially disrupts the orderly learning environment or poses a threat to the health, safety, and/or welfare of students, staff, or others.”\n\nStates let school districts define punishment\n\nMany states use similarly unspecific language in their discipline codes, if they provide any guidance at all, a review of state policies found.\n\nFor education departments that do provide definitions to districts, subjectivity is frequently built in. In Louisiana’s state guidance, for instance, “treats authority with disrespect” includes “any act which demonstrates a disregard or interference with authority.”\n\nTed Beasley, spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Education, said in an email that discipline codes are not defined in state statutes and that “school discipline is a local school system issue.”\n\nOfficials in several other states said the same.\n\nThe result, as demonstrated by a review of discipline records from eight states, is a broad interpretation of the categories: Students were suspended for shoving, yelling at peers, throwing objects, and violating dress codes. Some students were suspended for a single infraction; others broke several rules.\n\nIn fewer than 15% of cases, students got in trouble for using profanity, according to a Hechinger analysis of the records. The rate was similar for when they yelled at or talked back to administrators. In at least 20% of cases, students refused a direct order and in 6%, they were punished for misusing technology, including being on the cell phones during class or using school computers inappropriately.\n\n“What is defiance to one is not defiance to all, and that becomes confusing, not just for the students, but also the adults,” said Harry Lawson, human and civil rights director for the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union. “Those terms that are littered throughout a lot of codes of conduct, depending on the relationship between people, can mean very different things.”\n\nBut giving teachers discretion in how to assign discipline isn’t necessarily a problem, said Adam Tyner, national research director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. “The whole point of trusting, in this case, teachers, or anyone, to do their job is to be able to let them have responsibility and make some judgment calls,” he said.\n\nTyner added that it’s important to think about all students when considering school discipline policies. “If a student is disrupting the class, it may not help them all that much to take them and put them in a different environment, but it sure might help the other students who are trying to learn,” he said.\n\nJohanna Lacoe spent years trying to measure exactly that – the effect of discipline reforms on all students In Philadelphia, including those who hadn’t been previously suspended. The district banned out-of-school suspensions for many nonviolent offenses in 2012.\n\nCritics of the policy shift warned that it would harm students who do behave in class; they’d learn less or even come to school less often. Lacoe’s research found that schools faithfully following the new rules saw no decrease in academic achievement or attendance for non-suspended students.\n\nBut, the policy wasn’t implemented consistently, the researchers found. The schools that complied already issued the fewest suspensions; it was easier for them to make the policy shift, Lacoe said. In schools that kept suspending students, despite the ban, test scores and student attendance fell slightly.\n\nOverall, though, students who had been previously suspended showed improvements. Lacoe called eliminating out-of-school suspensions for minor infractions a “no brainer.”\n\n“We know suspensions aren’t good for kids,” said Lacoe, the research director of the California Policy Lab's site at the University of California, Berkeley. The group partners with government agencies to research the impact of policies. “Kicking kids out of school and providing them no services and no support and then returning them to the environment where nothing has changed is not a good solution.”\n\nStudents say suspensions are ineffective\n\nThis fall, two high schoolers in Providence, Rhode Island, walked out of a classroom. They later learned they were being suspended for their action, because it was considered disrespectful to a teacher.\n\n“It’s because they don’t like us,” said one of the students, Anaya, whose last name is being withheld to protect her privacy.\n\nIn 2021-22, disorderly conduct and insubordination made up a third of all Providence Public School suspensions.\n\nDistrict spokesperson Jay Wegimont said in an email that the district uses many alternatives to suspension, and out-of-school suspensions are only given to respond to “persistent conduct which substantially impedes the ability of other students to learn.”\n\nBut nearly all parents and students interviewed for this series who have dealt with suspension for violations such as disrespect and disorderly conduct also said that the punishment often did nothing but leave the student frustrated with the school and damage the student’s relationships with teachers.\n\nFrom a suspended student to an advocate for others\n\nAt a Cincinnati high school in 2019, Yousuf Munir led a peaceful protest about the impact of climate change, with about 50 fellow students. Munir, then a junior, planned to leave school and join a larger protest at City Hall. The principal said Munir couldn’t go and threatened to assign detention.\n\nMunir left anyway.\n\nThat detention morphed into suspension for disobeying the principal, said Munir, who remembers thinking: “The only thing you’re doing is literally keeping me out of class.”\n\nThe district told The Hechinger Report that Munir was suspended for leaving campus without written permission, a decision in line with the district’s code of conduct.\n\nThe whole incident left Munir feeling “so angry I didn’t know what to do with it.” They went on to start the Young Activists Coalition, which advocated for fair discipline and restorative practices at Cincinnati Public Schools.\n\nNow in college, Munir is a mentor to high school kids. “I can’t imagine ever treating a kid that way,” they said.\n\nSearching for consequences beyond suspension\n\nParents and students around the country described underlying reasons for behavior problems that a suspension would do little to address: Struggles with anxiety. Frustration with not understanding classwork. Distraction by events in their personal lives.\n\nDiscipline records are also dotted with examples that indicate a deeper cause for the misbehavior.\n\nIn one case, a student in Rhode Island was suspended for talking back to her teachers; the discipline record notes that her mother had recently died and the student might need counseling. A student in Minnesota “lost his cool” after having “his buttons pushed by a couple peers.” He cursed and argued back. A Maryland student who went to the main office to report being harassed cursed at administrators when asked to formally document it.\n\nTo be sure, discipline records disclose only part of a school’s response, and many places may simultaneously be working to address root causes. Even as they retain – and exercise – the right to suspend, many districts across the country have adopted alternative strategies aimed at building relationships and repairing harm caused by misconduct.\n\n“There needs to be some kind of consequence for acting out, but 9 out of 10 times, it doesn’t need to be suspension,” said Judy Brown, a social worker in Minneapolis Public Schools.\n\nSome educators who have embraced alternatives say in the long run they’re more effective. Suspension temporarily removes kids; it rarely changes behavior when they return.\n\n“It’s really about having the compassion and the time and patience to be able to have these conversations with students to see what the antecedent of the behavior is,” Brown said. “It’s often not personal; they’re overwhelmed.”\n\nIn some cases, students act out because they don’t want to be at school at all and know the quickest escape is misbehavior.\n\nOn Valentine's day 2022, a Maryland seventh grader showed up to school late. She then refused to go to class or leave the hallway and, according to her Dorchester County discipline record, was disrespectful towards an educator. \"These are the behaviors (the student) typically displays when she does not want to go to class,\" her record reads.\n\nBy 8:30 she was suspended and sent home for three days.\n\nDorchester County school officials declined to comment. In 2021-22, 38% of suspensions and expulsions in the district were assigned for disrespect and disruption.\n\nThis district took a hard look at its discipline practices\n\nLast year, administrators in Minnesota’s Monticello School District spent the summer overhauling their discipline procedures and consequences, out of concern that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. They developed clearer definitions for violation categories and instituted non-exclusionary tools to deal with isolated minor misbehaviors.\n\nPreviously, the district suspended students for telling an “inappropriate joke” in class or cursing, records show. Those types of behavior will now be dealt with in schools, Superintendent Eric Olsen said, but repeated refusals and noncompliance could still lead to a suspension.\n\n“Would I ever want to see a school where we can’t suspend? I would not,” he said. “Life is always about balance.”\n\nOlsen wants his students – all students – to feel valued and be successful. But they’re not his only consideration. “You also have to think of your employees,” he said. “There’s also that fine line of making sure your staff feels safe.”\n\nMonticello, like most school districts across the country, has seen an increase in student misconduct since schools reopened after pandemic closures. A 2023 survey found that more than 40% of educators felt less safe in their schools compared with 2019 and, in some instances, teachers have been injured in violent incidents, including shootings.\n\nAnd even before 2020, educators nationwide were warning that they lacked the appropriate mental health and social service supports to adequately deal with behavior challenges. Some nonviolent problems, like refusal to put phones away or stay in one’s seat, can make it difficult for teachers to effectively do their jobs.\n\nAnd the discipline records reviewed by The Hechinger Report do capture a sampling of more severe misbehavior. In some cases, students were labeled defiant or disorderly for fighting, throwing chairs or even hitting a teacher.\n\nShatara Clark taught for 10 years in Alabama before feeling too disrespected and overextended to keep going. She recalled regular disobedience from students.\n\n“Sometimes I look back like, ‘How did I make it?’” Clark said. “My blood pressure got high and everything.”\n\nShe became so familiar with the protocol for discipline referrals that she can still remember every step two years after leaving the classroom. In her schools, students were suspended for major incidents like fighting or threatening a teacher but also for repeated nonviolent behavior like interrupting or speaking out in class.\n\nClark said discipline records often don’t show the full context. “Say for instance, a boy got suspended for talking out of turn. Well, you're not going to know that he's done that five times, and I've called his parents,” she said. “Then you see someone that's been suspended for fighting, and it looks like the same punishment for a lesser thing.”\n\nIn many states, reform advocates and student activists pushing to ban harsh discipline policies have found a receptive audience in lawmakers. Many teachers are also sympathetic to their arguments; the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers support discipline reform and alternatives to suspension.\n\nIn some instances, though, teachers have resisted efforts to curtail suspensions, saying they need to have the option to remove kids from school.\n\nMany experts say the largest hurdle to getting teachers to embrace discipline reforms is that new policies are often rolled out without training or adequate staffing and support.\n\nWithout those things, “the policy change is somewhat of a paper tiger,” said Richard Welsh, an associate professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University. “If we don’t think about the accompanying support, it’s almost as if some of these are unfunded mandates.”\n\nIn Monticello, Olsen has focused on professional development for teachers to promote alternatives to suspension. The district has created space for students to talk about their actions and how they can rebuild relationships.\n\nIt’s still a work in progress. Teacher training, Olsen says, is key.\n\n“You can’t just do a policy change and expect everyone to magically do it.”\n\nCONTRIBUTING: Hadley Hitson of the Montgomery Advertiser and Madeline Mitchell of the Cincinnati Enquirer, members of the USA TODAY Network; and Amanda Chen, Tazbia Fatima, Sara Hutchinson, Tara García Mathewson, and Nirvi Shah, The Hechinger Report.\n\nNote: The Hechinger Report'sFazil Khan had nearly completed the data analysis and reporting for this project when he died in a fire in his apartment building.

Trussville City Schools Superintendent Pattie Neill’s contract was scheduled to expire June 30, 2026, but her attorney renegotiated the pact that will now end Oct. 31, 2023. Neill will be paid through that date but will no longer be in charge of the district, which is in a suburb of Birmingham, al.com reports. “It provides us an opportunity to move forward; it provides us an opportunity to have a fresh start,” Trussville City Board of Education Vice President Kim DeShazo said of the negotiation involving Neill. “I am looking forward to our city being in the news for the things that we have to celebrate because Trussville City Schools does have a lot to celebrate and a lot to be thankful for ... I’m looking forward to the next chapter.” The board named Interim Superintendent Frank Costanzo as the district’s acting superintendent as the system begins the search for Neill’s permanent replacement. Since Sept. 30, Neill had been on a 60-day leave of absence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said Wednesday that he is satisfied with Alaska’s ballot counting process and that there are no plans for a statewide hand-count audit of a race like the one he called for two years ago. Meyer oversees elections in Alaska and after the 2020 general election announced plans for an audit of votes on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed. He cast the audit, conducted after the race was certified, as a way to address questions that had been raised about the validity of election results tied to vote tabulation equipment used by the state. The audit affirmed the passage of the initiative, which ended party primaries and instituted ranked-choice voting in general elections. This year’s elections were the first held under the new elections process. Meyer and Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai held a briefing with reporters Wednesday, ahead of next week’s election. Meyer said he is “satisfied that the process works and that there’s enough checks and balances in place that if something isn’t quite right, we’ll catch it soon.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Meyer said that with the 2020 review, “we were able to show folks that the machines worked correctly.” He said it has been frustrating to see people get misinformation from social media or from online videos.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A planned research center operated by the University of Arizona will get a $150million allocation of federal money via the state, officials announced Wednesday. The designation comes from money the state received through the American Rescue Plan Act, C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Gov. Doug Ducey, wrote in an email. The funds will go to the UA Health Sciences’ planned Phoenix-based Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies, which will be part of the downtown, 30-acre Phoenix Bioscience Core campus. There are no current cost estimates for the project, UA officials said Wednesday. The Phoenix Bioscience Core includes several education, health care and research entities, including the Arizona-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, the UA College of Medicine Phoenix, and the Dignity Health-Cancer Institute at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center. The Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies intends to advance immunology research in four areas: cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and real-time immune system monitoring, UA officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: Two former Crawford County deputies fired over excessive force complaints had requested a public hearing Wednesday in efforts to clear their names, but they didn’t show up, the sheriff’s office reports. Neither Levi White nor Zack King appeared at the sheriff’s department lobby Wednesday. Instead, a woman showed up to make accusations that she, too, has been roughed up during an arrest by White. White and King were caught on video making a rough arrest of Randal Worcester on Aug. 21. The video taken by a bystander showed White, King and a Mulberry police officer, Thell Riddle, beating Worcester after a convenience store clerk in Alma claimed Worcester threatened her. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith, who previously represented Worcester, said he is now represented by another attorney in Oklahoma City. Powell is now representing Tammy Nelson, who said on Aug. 21, she was at her home, where she was involved in a civil matter that resulted in a heated argument that didn’t go well. White was sent to the call, where things escalated for the worse, she said. “I was just attacked by him and violated and thrown to the ground,” Nelson said. She was arrested and jailed on complaints of obstruction of a government operation and harassment. Powell said he has heard from other clients with such complaints.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting state officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay. The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90% were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general’s office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI’s database, and nearly 800 resulted in “hits.”\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho Springs: The Colorado city of Idaho Springs said Wednesday it has agreed to pay $7 million to a 75-year-old man who said an officer used a stun gun on him without warning and dragged him from his apartment after a dispute with a neighbor, causing a stroke that left him with permanent injuries. Michael Clark alleged in the federal civil rights suit filed last year that he suffered numerous health problems after Officer Nicholas Hanning used a Taser on him in his home in Idaho Springs, causing Clark to lose consciousness, fall and strike his head. Clark also accused Hanning of putting a knee on his neck, depriving him of oxygen and increasing his risk of death. Hanning, who was fired after the May 2021 encounter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and relinquished his right to serve as a law enforcement officer in Colorado. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation and community service. The Idaho Springs statement said the city admits no liability but is settling the case “for economic reasons and to bring closure to all involved.” It did say the city and Police Chief Nate Buseck “acknowledge the poor judgment that led to the use” of the Taser against Clark, which Buseck previously described as unacceptable. “He is wheelchair bound and now forever dependent on his family and doctors to survive,” Clark’s attorney, Sarah Schielke, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A man who was linked to the sexual assaults of four women in 1984 by information on a genealogy database was convicted Wednesday of all eight kidnapping charges against him. A state jury in Hartford took less than an hour of deliberations to unanimously convict Michael Sharpe after a five-day trial. He faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 9. Sharpe, 71, who had been free on a promise to appear in court, was detained after the verdicts because a judge set a new bond at $2.5 million. At least two of the victims were in the courtroom and wept after the verdicts were announced, The Hartford Courant reports. Sharpe’s public defender, Dana Sanetti, said in her closing argument Tuesday that the only evidence connecting Sharpe to the attacks was his DNA, which was only “a piece of the puzzle,” Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Sharpe, of Marlborough, was once the chief executive officer of a group that ran the Jumoke Academy, a tuition-free charter school in Hartford. Prosecutors said he broke into the women’s homes in four different towns and sexually assaulted them at gunpoint in June and July of 1984. Investigators found DNA evidence at the homes, but no matches could be found at the time, and the cases went cold.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A big change is coming for the state’s surf-fishing car tag program: There will be no cap on the number of permits issued for 2023, according to an announcement from State Parks Director Ray Bivens on Wednesday. Yes, that means people don’t have to rush to the computer or Delaware State Parks’ gates to snag those coveted surf-fishing tags that allow drive-on beach access. No longer crushed by the “sold out” announcement from State Parks, anyone who wants a surf-fishing tag can now get one. Still, there was a reason the cap was put in place − to protect the natural resources and manage crowds. That’s where another change comes in. After a stakeholder group met this spring, State Parks announced it will be piloting a new reservation system for 36 of the busiest days during the season. The pilot reservation system and lifting of the cap come after the demand for surf-fishing permits has continued to grow in recent years and peaked at unprecedented heights in the past two years. In 2020, the maximum 17,000 tags sold out in just a few months, prompting the state to release an additional 1,000 tags. Eager anglers and beach enthusiasts lined up overnight for a chance to get one of these extra permits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Internationally renowned chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up with Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday for a friendly cooking competition at his newly opened restaurant in the nation’s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips opened Oct. 25 in The Wharf area of the city. The location is the third in the franchise, his take on the classic English street food. The menu ranges from classic fish and chips to chicken, shrimp, “dirty chips” and Gordon’s signature shakes: Sticky Toffee and Biscoff. During the competition, Bowser got to try her hand at one of the signature shakes with the help of Ramsay. The famed chef and the mayor competed against Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio and chef Christina Wilson, who won season 10 of Ramsay’s reality show “Hell’s Kitchen,” to see who could make the best Biscoff shake. The Ramsay-Bowser duo claimed victory. There could be a chance for a rematch in the future, as restaurateur Ramsay is not stopping with the Fish & Chips location in D.C. He is also opening his wildly popular Hell’s Kitchen restaurant, inspired by the show of the same name, on The Wharf as well in early 2023. Until then, the Fish & Chips location in D.C. is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday-Saturday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida State University held a memorial service on campus Wednesday evening to remember the victims of the 2018 yoga studio shooting in the city. The service marked four years since the mass shooting took place at Tallahassee Hot Yoga, where Scott Paul Beierle killed two women, 21-year-old Maura Binkley and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, and injured five other victims before killing himself. A key part of the service was the announcement of a new initiative called “Florida State United: One Voice Against Hate,” which aims to bring more awareness to hate crimes through research and education. “As Maura and Nancy exemplified in their lives, love is the most important work we can do,” Jeff Binkley, Maura Binkley’s father, said to the FSU and Tallahassee community as they were gathered near the Integration Statue on campus. “Always remember that only love can conquer hate.” Maura Binkley was a senior at FSU double majoring in German and English, and Van Vessem was a chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan, as well as a former faculty member at FSU’s College of Medicine. Signs were placed throughout the area with phrases such as “A Voice for Safety,” “A Voice for Peace” and “A Voice for Freedom.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency has stopped accepting applications from people seeking assistance with their rent payments, saying money from the federally funded aid program has begun to run out. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs posted an announcement on its website last week that the agency is no longer taking rental assistance applications, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The news caught housing advocates off guard and left some tenants scrambling to pay rent with little warning, said Lindsay Siegel, director of housing advocacy at Legal Aid of Atlanta. “The DCA put some tenants in a pretty bad position,” Siegel said. “If they knew they were running out of money, they should have told them so they could plan.” The federal government put $46.5 billion into an emergency rental assistance program in 2020 in hopes of averting spikes in evictions and homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Treasury Department reported a year ago that several states and large cities had already exhausted their share of the funding. Now Georgia is getting close to running out of rental assistance money, prompting the Department of Community Affairs to suspend applications, agency Commissioner Christopher Nunn said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The ground is still shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating it could erupt. Scientists say they don’t expect that to happen right away, but officials on the Big Island are telling residents to be prepared. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest – that title goes to Mauna Kea – but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass. It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is currently erupting from its summit crater. Kilauea is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean. Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. In written history, dating to 1843, it has erupted 33 times. The Big Island is mostly rural and is home to cattle ranches, coffee farms and beach resorts. Mauna Loa’s eruptions differ from Kilauea’s in part because it is taller. Its greater height gives it steeper slopes, which allow lava to rush down its hillsides faster than Kilauea’s. Its enormous size may allow it to store more magma, leading to larger lava flows when an eruption occurs. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has more than 60 GPS stations on Mauna Loa taking measurements to estimate the location and the amount of magma accumulating beneath the surface. There’s also a thermal webcam at Mauna Loa’s summit that will identify the presence of heat. And satellite radar can keep track of ground swelling and deflation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A high-profile attorney who has defended in state and federal courts some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is among the latest attorneys to quit state employment. Former Deputy Attorney General Megan Larrondo is one of eight attorneys and a handful of other staffers who have left or are leaving the Idaho attorney general’s office following Raúl Labrador’s win over five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the Republican primary in May. More departures are expected. Information obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows that Larrondo’s job ended Monday. Court documents filed Friday in both U.S. District Court in Idaho and the Idaho Supreme Court show filings requesting Larrondo be removed as attorney of record in the state’s abortion cases. The state and federal courts have yet to make final rulings in those cases. Labrador, a former U.S. representative who has said voters are looking for an aggressive, conservative attorney general, has promised to make the office more partisan should he win in next week’s general election. In a series of recent interviews, he denigrated attorneys working in the office, telling the Lewiston Tribune that the “Attorney General’s Office needs to have better lawyers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The 2018 killing of “ZackTV,” a trailblazer in a perilous genre of gangland reporting he called “‘hood CNN,” seemed destined to go unsolved, even though gunmen attacked him on a downtown Chicago street lined with surveillance cameras. Police never announced arrests in the shooting of Zachary Stoner, who drew a national YouTube following filling a media niche with up-close stories about the lives and deaths of gang members and affiliated rappers from places other reporters were afraid to go. But police records obtained by the Associated Press reveal investigators believe they solved his homicide years ago when they arrested members of South Side Chicago’s “Perry Avenue” gang. Yet prosecutors in 2019 declined to prosecute, and police were forced to release the suspects. Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office cited the possibility that the two sides in the shooting on May 30, 2018, were “mutual combatants” – a disputed legal concept that’s a throwback to duels between nobles or prearranged gunfights in the Wild West. That prosecutors passed on charges on those grounds raises questions about whether Chicago gangs can literally get away with murder when it’s unclear who initiated a shooting and who returned fire in self-defense.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is planning his fifth overseas trip of the year, this time to attend a U.N. climate conference in Egypt. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office announced Wednesday that he would take part in the COP27 climate change conference. Holcomb’s schedule includes giving a speech about Indiana’s efforts to increase use of clean energy in the state, the governor’s office said. “I look forward to highlighting the ongoing ways Hoosiers continue to pioneer the way forward, develop sustainable solutions, and lead productive global conversations,” Holcomb said in a statement. Holcomb and state Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers will be part of an Indiana delegation arriving Sunday in Egypt and returning to Indiana on Nov. 12. The trip is being paid for with private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the governor’s office said. Holcomb also plans meetings with businesses and foreign governments and organizations during the conference drawing leaders from nearly 200 nations. The governor has made four previous economic development this year, including to Germany and Switzerland last month and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May. He made two trips in the spring that took him to Sweden, Great Britain, Monaco, Slovakia and Israel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This week the Des Moines Area Religious Council’s network of food pantries broke the record for the number of individuals helped during a single day in the network’s 46-year history. On Tuesday, the network of 15 pantries assisted 1,530 individuals across Polk County, beating the previous record of 1,476 individuals helped in one day Sept. 3, 2019, according to a DMARC news release. Matt Unger, the CEO of DMARC, said even though he expected the record to be broken this month, seeing it happen is still “jarring.” He said he expects this November to be the busiest month in the network’s history. “It’s going to be a big month and it is going to take a tremendous amount of public support for ALL organizations working in the food insecurity space to make sure our community members have AT LEAST the basic groceries they and their households need,” Unger wrote in an email. According to DMARC, rising costs for essential goods such as food and gasoline, coupled with the decrease in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in April, have contributed to the rise in people in need across Iowa. Michelle Book, the president of Food Bank of Iowa, said 1 in 7 working households across the state cannot cover the costs of their basic needs.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A former undersheriff was acquitted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed man he shot with a defective beanbag round five years ago. Virgil Brewer was charged with involuntary manslaughter after he shot Steven Myers using his personal shotgun the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A Wyandotte County jury deliberated for four hours after a weeklong trial before returning the not-guilty verdict. It was unclear if Brewer, who has been on unpaid leave from the Barber County Sheriff’s department since his 2018 arrest, would return to his former role. Brewer and two other officers responded to a call about an armed man on a street after an altercation at a Sun City bar. Myers, who was drunk and had been told to leave the bar, was gone by the time officers arrived. They found him in a shed at a Sun City home. He came out of the shed, and Brewer shot him at close range with a beanbag, which split open and emptied pellets into his chest, causing fatal injuries. Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill ruled Myers’ death a homicide. An expert testified at trial that the beanbag round was defective and should never have been sold or distributed, defense attorney David Harger said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In a move that experts describe as outrageous, the Kentucky Bar Association is seeking to punish a lawyer who brought a scandal to light this summer in which an elected prosecutor was trading favors with a defendant in exchange for nude images of her. An inquiry panel has accused attorney Thomas Clay of violating what is known informally as the “squeal rule” or “rat rule.” The rule says that when a lawyer knows another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Misconduct raising a “substantial question about their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness,” the first lawyer must report it to bar counsel. When Clay learned that Commonwealth’s Attorney Ronny Goldy Jr. had for several years done favors for a defendant in exchange for her giving him nude photos and videos of herself, he reported it to the FBI but not to the bar association’s disciplinary counsel. Clay provided the FBI and the Louisville Courier Journal with 230 pages of Facebook messages documenting the quid quo pro. Just two days after the newspaper published a story that included excerpts of the messages, the bar moved to temporarily suspend Goldy, the elected prosecutor for Bath, Menifee, Montgomery and Rowan counties. Clay’s lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, said his client deserves “praise, not sanction.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A little more than 12% of registered voters in the state have cast their ballots ahead of next week’s elections, keeping up with Louisiana’s steady increase in midterm election turnout. Of the 363,009 residents who participated in the state’s early voting period, which ended Tuesday night, about 42% were registered Democrats, and 43% were Republicans, according to data from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office. Most Louisiana voters opt to vote in person on Election Day. But the percentage who vote early has been steadily increasing. During 2018 midterm elections, about 11% of voters cast their ballots early, up from 8% in 2014 and 4% in 2010. Early voting topped 32% in 2020, though presidential election years tend to draw far more voters than midterms. The state has placed a number of restrictions on mail-in voting. Absentee ballots need a notary or witness signature and can only go to older people, those with disabilities or voters who can show they cannot cast a ballot in person on Election Day. This election, absentee ballots went to about 3% of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: More than $4.3 million in federal funds is on its way to the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District to help purchase 11 new, clean, zero-emission school buses. Such funds essentially will help the district swap out its current fleet of 12 diesel-engine buses. David Cash, the New England regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, made Wells his first stop Monday on his tour of Maine school districts that will be receiving their own slices of more than $13 million from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program. Cash said the buses currently in use create pollution with “long-term impacts on our kids” and contribute to “problematic” issues related to climate change. He called the $5 billion being spent nationwide for new, “clean” school buses “tremendous.” “It’s incumbent upon us to make the right kind of choices and the right kind of investments,” he said. WOCSD is one of 13 school districts in the state that President Joe Biden announced would be part of his administration’s funding for the bus program for the current fiscal year. The funds are a part of the infrastructure bill Biden signed into law last year. WOCSD is receiving the largest share of the $13 million. Overall, the grant funds will help with the purchases of 34 “clean” buses for school districts throughout the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nMontgomery County: Vulgar signs atop a busy roadway are grabbing the attention of drivers and neighbors alike, WUSA-TV reports. Conservative activist Shaun Porter and several other people have recently been holding signs atop the Capital Beltway on the Bradley Boulevard overpass. While holding politically tinged signs near roadways is not a new phenomenon in the D.C. region, Porter’s signs include curse words and sexually graphic language directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Jobe Lett, an 11-year-old Montgomery County resident who lives nearby the overpass, said the signs have become a distraction in his neighborhood “because of the language that they’re using.” Data provided by the state shows more than 200,000 people drive the beltway around the Bradley Boulevard overpass every day. But some of those drivers honk at Porter’s signs. That has also become a problem for neighbors. Homes surround the overpass on both sides. “Hey, I support everyone’s right to (free speech),” Montgomery County Jesse Sanders said. “I just kind of wish it wasn’t in the most residential of areas.” Maryland State Police said obscenity laws are vague, and they have questions about infringing on Porter’s First Amendment rights by asking him to stop.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities who earlier this week said they had finally identified the “Lady of the Dunes,” the woman whose mutilated body was found on Cape Cod in 1974, are now looking for information about a man she may have married. The late Guy Rockwell Muldavin is believed to have married Ruth Marie Terry in February 1974, just a few months before the 37-year-old Terry’s body was found in Provincetown, according to a statement Wednesday from state police, Provincetown police and the Cape and Islands district attorney’s office. Investigators are asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of Terry or Muldavin in New England in 1973 or 1974 to contact them. Muldavin, described as an antiques dealer who also used the names Raoul Guy Rockwell and Guy Muldavin Rockwell, was a suspect in the deaths of a previous wife and a stepdaughter in Seattle in 1960, according to media reports at the time. He was caught in New York City and charged with “unlawful flight.” He died in California in 2002, according to his obituary. The death of the “Lady of the Dunes” was one of the most enduring and frustrating murder mysteries in Massachusetts. A young girl out for a walk found the body in the dunes in Provincetown in July 1974. The woman was naked on a beach blanket with her hands severed – so she could not be identified by her fingerprints, officials said. Her skull was crushed, and she was nearly decapitated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A shortage of poll workers has concerned local election officials in some parts of the country, but Michigan is facing a different side of the trend. Conservative groups and local Republican Party operatives who have pushed false claims about the 2020 presidential election have recruited poll workers in the state by the thousands. Similar recruitment efforts on the right have bolstered the ranks of poll workers in some other states with nationally watched races. Seeding the ranks of front-line election workers with people recruited by groups promoting election conspiracies has raised alarms among some that the people at the foundation of the election system could try to undermine it. “It concerns me when the motivation to serve as a poll worker is fueled through misinformation and people who have been fed lies, in some cases, for years now,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. “Since the spring, clerks have come at us with concerning questions they’re getting and, in some cases, hundreds of poll worker applications that seem to be motivated by nefarious intent.” In Oakland County, the state’s second-most populous, Republicans “discouraged about the outcome of the 2020 election” have been urged to sign up as poll workers through a new Republican National Committee recruitment program.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a former public safety director from New Jersey to take over the city’s police department, as it struggles with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, will start serving as Minneapolis’ police chief Monday. “Everyone is hungry for change in this city. I’m not here to maintain the status quo,” he told reporters after the council vote. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey nominated O’Hara to lead the police department in September and said Thursday that the city needs someone like O’Hara right now. “This moment matters,” Frey said. “The act of stepping up for this job – at this time – is an act of courage.” Minneapolis has been at the center of calls for changes in policing since the May 2020 killing of Floyd, whose death under an officer’s knee led to nationwide demands for racial justice and an end to police brutality. Calls to abolish the department or dismantle and replace it with a new department of public safety were rejected by voters in the city last year. The city is also under a federal investigation into its policing practices, and it is expected that court-enforced changes will be ordered through a consent decree.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State lawmakers met in special session Wednesday and quickly approved nearly $247 million in incentives for an aluminum plant that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs to northern Mississippi by 2029. Many legislators voted on the incentives without knowing the name of the company. At a news conference as the session ended, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged the aluminum project is being developed by Steel Dynamics Inc., an Indiana-based company that already operates a steel mill near Columbus, Mississippi. “They are a fantastic employer in the Golden Triangle today,” Reeves said. Reeves had previously said a nondisclosure agreement prohibited him from publicly naming the company until the deal was done. Only the governor can call a special session, and Democratic legislators questioned why Reeves has not called sessions to address other issues, including funding for Jackson’s troubled water system or for struggling rural hospitals. “Many Mississippians are suffering and dying. But none of these things, despite being matters of literal life and death, compelled the governor to call a special session,” Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez said Wednesday during a Democratic Caucus news conference. “So, what compelled him to bring us back again? A victory lap being portrayed publicly as an emergency? But this feels a lot more like a campaign event, a political pep rally, than public service.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city will pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of an unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2019. The Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners approved the settlement with the family of Terrence Bridges Jr. in a closed meeting earlier this week, The Kansas City Star reports. Bridges, 30, was shot and killed after officers responded to a reported carjacking. Police had contended he was resisting arrest and was shot during a struggle with the officer, identified in police records as Dylan Pifer. The officer told investigators he feared for his life because he thought Bridges was pulling a gun from a sweatshirt. Bridges’ family and civil rights activists said he was not armed, not resisting, did not pose a threat to the officer and was not involved in the carjacking. Tom Porto, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement the settlement represents the police department’s acknowledgement of the tragic and significant loss to Bridges’ family. Pifer, who is still on the police force, was not charged in the killing. A year after Bridges’ death, Pifer was with Sgt. Matthew T. Neal as Neal injured a 15-year-old boy by slamming his face into the pavement after stopping a car the teenager was in. Neal left the department after pleading guilty last week to third-degree assault. He was placed on four years’ probation. Pifer was not charged.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While Budweiser and Coors Light remain the state’s favorite beers, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Department of Agriculture Director Christy Clark have signed a letter of understanding saying Heineken’s parent company, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A., will do more business in Montana, including buying more Treasure State barley. The deal was announced Tuesday, The Daily Montanan reports. While the letter of intent didn’t commit the beverage industry giant to specific amounts or prices, it did say the company was committed to using more Montana products in its beer manufacturing. The “intent to procure increased volumes of high-quality Montana barley” will be met with “transparent market information, producer consultations, and continued investments in barley research” by the state, according to the letter. Gianforte, as well as leaders from Heineken and the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee along with members of the U.S. Grain Council, signed the letter at Bos Hay and Grain at Gallatin Gateway. “We’re thrilled Heineken recognized the superior quality of Montana barley and wants to do more business with our farmers,” Gianforte said. ‘This agreement ushers in tremendous opportunities for our ag industry.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: In the wake of a Halloween block party where a man drove around barricades and toward the crowd before a police officer shot and wounded him, counselors and government officials have been offering help for those who witnessed the chaos. Therapists were available Thursday evening at Minne Lusa Elementary School for those dealing with stress from Monday night’s incident in the same neighborhood, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Project Harmony Deputy Director told the newspaper that officials were hoping to help kids and adults alike process the experience and normalize their feelings, which she said might include fixating on the event, sleep interruptions, irritability and fearing for their own safety. The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out. Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely. Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. It’s not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada asked the state’s secretary of state Wednesday to investigate what it called a “coordinated partisan election administration effort” during rural Nye County’s hand-count of mail-in ballots that was shut down last week until after polls close. The ACLU said a hand-count volunteer openly carrying a firearm removed an ACLU observer from a hand-count tally room, which the organization said it recently discovered was Nye County GOP Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen. The ACLU said the situation “poses questions” surrounding Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf’s delegation of authority to partisan officials to remove observers from hand-count rooms, particularly during a hand-count process that deals with tabulation of ballots.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A boil water order for customers of the Rye Water District has now stretched into its third week following the detection of harmful bacteria in district water samples in mid-October. A public informational meeting has been set for this weekend to discuss the order. Town leaders are continuing to distribute cases of bottled water to affected residents as Rye Water District leadership awaits the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services’ lifting of the order. Three weeks since the enactment of the order, Rye Water District superintendent Arik Jones said he still feels it could take several more days before it’s over. The cause of the water contamination has not been identified, though Jones stated that potential causes could be from “improper irrigation operation and/or maintenance.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDelran: A $2.5 million upgrade at a water-treatment plant here is intended to remove a potentially harmful contaminant from a major source of South Jersey’s drinking water. New Jersey American Water said the improvements will target a man-made chemical found more than two years ago in samples taken from the Delaware River. The utility’s Delran plant processes up to 40 million gallons of river water daily for use by hundreds of thousands of customers in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties. The chemical – 1,4-dioxane – is used as a solvent during manufacturing or industrial processes, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. It is also a byproduct of some consumer products, including detergents and cosmetics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Work to plug hundreds of abandoned oil and gas wells began in southeast New Mexico, amid the U.S.’ most active oilfields in the Permian Basin. The State’s Oil Conservation Division, an agency of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, got about $25 million in initial grant funding via the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, hoping to redouble efforts to plug some of the about 1,700 wells believed to be abandoned throughout New Mexico on state and private land. Operations began Oct. 31 at a well east of Hobbs in Lea County. It was prioritized, the OCD said, as it was reportedly emitting large amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide within 1,000 feet of local homes. Before the federal funds were granted, New Mexico was able to plug about 50 wells a year, but the OCD estimated the funds would allow the agency to clean up about 200 wells in the next 12 months. The money will also help remediate and restore the surfaces of another 50 to 60 locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York will receive up to $524 million from drugmaker Teva to settle claims that the company contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the largest amount secured from an opioid manufacturer or distributor sued by the state, Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday. The state has reached a series of settlements with drug companies following an attorney general’s lawsuit in 2019 accusing them of deceptive marketing and failing to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates were found liable last year for public nuisance charges by a jury on Long Island. To resolve the remedies phase, Teva agreed to pay out $313 million over 18 years, James said. New York will additionally receive $211 million from a $4.3 billion national settlement Teva agreed to in July if it is approved by state and local governments and tribes, according to the attorney general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health agency is weighing whether to challenge a judge’s order demanding that the state ramp up services for people with intellectual and development disabilities to allow more of them to live at home or in their communities. In 2020, Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ruled that too many such people were forced to live in institutions in violation of state law. Baddour allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to address the violation, but recommendations made by a consulting firm haven’t been carried out, the judge wrote Wednesday while directing his own remedies. Baddour ordered that at least 3,000 people must be diverted or shifted to community-based programs by early 2031. Separately, he told DHHS to eliminate before 2032 a waiting list of roughly 16,000 people who are qualified to participate in a Medicaid-funded program that helps them live at home or outside of an institution. A shortage of well-paid direct-care workers also must be addressed by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the judge ruled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An invasive and destructive weed species threatening North Dakota agriculture has been found in three more counties. That raises the total to 19 counties in North Dakota where the so-called “super weed,” also known as Palmer amaranth, has been found since it was first identified in the state four years ago, The Bismarck Tribune reported. “We think it’s a very significant threat to our growers and ranchers,” said Tom Peters, an agronomist and weed control specialist at North Dakota State University and the University of Minnesota. Palmer amaranth can grow as tall as seven feet, even as much as 3 inches per day, and can resist many herbicides, produce hundreds of thousands of seeds and become strong enough to stop farm machinery, according to experts. A heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%, according to research by Purdue University. The plants were recently found in Kidder, Williams and Stark counties, according to the state’s agriculture department. The findings were confirmed by the National Agricultural Genotyping Center at NDSU in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit in Ohio is evoking Christmas memories with a display of historic storybooks, vintage toys and costumes from the sets of the “Brady Bunch” of TV and movies. The show, “A Storybook Christmas Featuring a Very Brady Holiday,” opened Tuesday at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and runs through Dec. 31. The exhibition marks the opening of the holiday season at the historic Reese-Peters House that houses the museum. Across five rooms trimmed for the holidays, visitors will be invited to step into the pages of classic Christmas storybooks including “The Night Before Christmas,” “Polar Express” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Some children’s board books and pop-up books will be arranged with pages open for visitors to read, while others will be positioned along with toys under Christmas trees as gifts, replicating what Christmas morning may have looked like for the Bradys and other families in the 1960s and ’70s. Several costumes and props from the “Brady Bunch” sets have been incorporated into the display by co-curator Randall Thropp, who manages the Paramount Pictures Costume Archive. They include a two-piece pantsuit Florence Henderson wore in the episode where the Bradys travel to the Grand Canyon and a horse sculpture that appeared at the base of the Bradys’ staircase.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt granted another temporary reprieve to death row inmate Richard Glossip, pushing his scheduled execution back until February 2023 so that an appeals court has more time to consider his claim of innocence. Stitt, who is locked in a tough reelection contest, issued an executive order on Wednesday that delays Glossip’s execution, which was scheduled for Nov. 21. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A clemency hearing for Glossip that was scheduled before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board next week also will be delayed. Glossip received the death penalty for the 1997 murder-for-hire killing of his boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese. Prosecutors acknowledge Glossip did not kill Van Treese, but maintain that he paid the hotel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, to do it. Sneed, who received a life sentence but was spared the death penalty, was a key witness in two separate trials in which Glossip was convicted.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland City Council members voted Thursday to create at least three large designated campsites and ban the rest of the roughly 700 encampments currently scattered across the city. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, according to the proposal. “People on the streets deserve our compassion. They need our understanding, and many of them need our help to get off and stay off the streets,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said after the vote. “It is my personal view that these resolutions take an important step forward for the city of Portland to be able to do just that.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A measure to help the Pennsylvania Turnpike recover more unpaid tolls was signed into law Thursday, legislation that could trigger the suspension of thousands of vehicle registrations early next year. Gov. Tom Wolf gave final approval to legislation aimed at getting owners or operators of some 25,000 vehicles to pay their overdue bills for turnpike travel. After the law takes effect in two months, the process will start with the Turnpike Commission notifying registrants they are seeking to have their registrations suspended. At least a month later, the toll agency can ask the Transportation Department to start the process, and PennDOT said it will give the owners six weeks’ notice. “The customer is given several notices and opportunities to pay the tolls they owe before their registration is suspended,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police are investigating an anti-Semitic note left at the reception area of the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design Hillel Center on Sunday. In a letter to the Hillel community, Rabbi Josh Bolton said staff alerted both the campus police and Providence police. “I personally came to campus and met with detectives who opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation remains ongoing,” Rabbi Bolton wrote. Public safety officers, he said, determined there was no threat to Jewish students on campus. Hillel opened its doors Monday at 9 am. “While BRH takes any expression of anti-Semitism very seriously, we will not allow an incident like this to divert our focus from our core mission of building a flourishing Jewish community, and supporting the growth of Jewish students on College Hill,” Bolton wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A man and his girlfriend suspected of killing five people in three states last year have pleaded guilty to two of the killings in South Carolina and have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, authorities said. Tyler Terry and Adrienne Simpson each pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and numerous other charges Wednesday in Chester County, according to media reports. Prosecutors agreed to not seek the death penalty in any of the five killings as long as the couple also pleaded guilty to two shootings near St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Memphis, Tennessee. All five deaths happened in May 2021, investigators said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The University of South Dakota received $552,381 to research the risk of emerging bed bug disease transmission in households across South Dakota earlier this month. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced seven universities were awarded $5.7 million to study populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, like pests, injury hazards and asthma triggers. Those focus populations will be young children and seniors. Although there isn’t evidence that indicates bed bugs are transmitting disease, the goal of the “pro-active” research project is to identify if there’s a risk bed bugs could eventually be contributing to disease in households, said Jose Pietri, the USD assistant professor of microbiology leading the project.\n\nTennessee\n\nMt. Juliet: A Tennessee man who fled a traffic stop with an officer in the vehicle and refused to stop has been fatally shot, authorities said. The shooting happened after Mt. Juliet officers stopped a vehicle late Wednesday and asked the passenger, Eric Jermaine Allen, 39, to exit the vehicle, according to preliminary information from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Instead of exiting, Allen moved from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and began to drive away, the bureau said in a statement. One of the officers attempted to stop Allen by leaning into the vehicle and gave commands for him to stop, but Allen drove away with the officer fully inside the vehicle, the statement said. The officer attempted to use a stun gun, but Allen continued to ignore commands to stop, prompting the officer to fatally shoot Allen. The officer was not injured. Bureau agents are working to independently determine the events leading to the shooting.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed Wednesday that he underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation therapy during the summer for bone cancer in his jaw. Turner made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session after he delivered his annual State of the City address, the Houston Chronicle reported. Turner said he underwent nine hours of surgery on July 30 to remove the osteosarcoma. “Let me tell you, I have been blessed,” Turner said to applause. Turner missed a few weeks of City Council meetings while receiving his radiation therapy in August and September. His staff said he was undergoing medical treatment but did not specify what for. Turner, who has served as Houston’s mayor since 2016 after 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, suffered a bout of COVID-19 last December.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella “Izzy” Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family’s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim.\n\nVermont\n\nStratton: Game wardens are investigating a bear attack in the southern Vermont town of Stratton, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said Thursday. Wardens said the victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the Wednesday evening attack and discharged from Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. Officials did not describe the circumstances of the attack, but said more information would be made public as it becomes available. Vermont wildlife officials said earlier this year that the state was seeing a record number of risky encounters between human and bears.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Seeking to learn more about the election integrity unit of Virginia’s attorney general’s office, the state’s chapter of the NAACP has put down a $20,000 deposit to fulfill a request for unit records. Virginia’s NAACP President Robert Barnette said there’s not enough transparency about the unit and he feels the price aims to discourage the Freedom of Information Act request, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. “Given the importance of fair elections, the attorney general’s stated desire for transparency, we would have thought he would want to make these records public,” Barnette said in a news conference outside the state Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The Bremerton City Council on Wednesday approved unanimously a plan to expand property tax exemptions for developers who build affordable housing in the city. The city remains “far behind the curve” in attracting affordable housing proposals and is thousands of units short of the number of people who desire to live in Bremerton, City Council President Michael Goodnow said. “I look at this as one tool in the toolbox toward solving our housing and homelessness issues,” Goodnow said. While beefing up what’s known as the city’s multifamily property tax exemption program, or MFTE for short, Mayor Greg Wheeler and other city council members had differing opinions about the best methods of bringing new affordable housing projects to the city. For now, the council created new property tax exemptions of both 12 and 20 years for developers who devote a fourth of their units to those defined as low income under a calculation using Kitsap County’s average income levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A West Virginia elementary school principal has been honored as one of the nation’s top educators. Principal Andrea Trio of Madison Elementary in Wheeling received a $25,000 Milken Educator Award from the Milken Family Foundation on Thursday. Up to 40 elementary educators nationwide will receive the awards this school year. Trio is known for walking through the school halls singing with children, using music and other social-emotional behavioral tools to calm her young students. Trio earned a bachelor’s in music education in 2005 from West Virginia University and a master’s in educational leadership in 2014 from Hood College.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Madison Children’s Museum has fired a Wisconsin man with cognitive disabilities after he wore an Adolf Hitler costume over the Halloween weekend. The museum said the man believed he was making a mockery of the Nazi Party’s leader when he wore the costume on a busy street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus on Saturday. He was fired Tuesday night, after his costume was condemned on social media and by some news outlets, including the Jerusalem Post. The museum said in a statement that it fired the man after it “determined that his continued employment would create an environment at odds with our values and unwelcoming to visitors and staff.” The statement said the man’s costume was “completely unacceptable” and that the museum stands against antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination. The museum also said the man has cognitive disabilities due to a traumatic brain injury and that his work over the last decade has been supervised. “It is our understanding that he believed his costume to be mocking Hitler,” the statement said. The Madison Police Department called the costume “offensive and reprehensible,” but said wearing it was not a crime. Police said they told the man about the concerns his costume raised.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Sexual assault reports and complaints about equal-opportunity employment in the Wyoming National Guard have increased in the past year, a military official told state lawmakers Wednesday. While Greg Porter, adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, noted that sexual assault is a national problem, he told the state’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee that the state ranks “among the top 10 in forcible rapes in the U.S.,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Rep. Mark Baker, R-Green River, said while reports in the Guard have risen – suggesting service members feel more comfortable speaking up – he still fears the numbers don’t properly illustrate the scope of the problem, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/25/teacher-strike-eagle-paradox-forest-restoration-news-around-states/50638451/", "title": "Teacher strike, eagle paradox: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: City leaders complained, yet agreed to a $5 million bailout to help the World Games 2022 reduce a roughly $15 million debt from the sporting event held in the city last month. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the metro area did benefit from the 11-day Olympics-style competition. But he also joined council members in criticizing a lack of transparency about the finances of the event, which featured sports ranging from parachuting to billiards. “I know each of you enough to know this sucks,” Mayor Randall Woodfin told the council at their meeting Tuesday. “I feel the same way you feel.” The World Games lost $2.5 million in expected sponsorships in May, and ticket sales fell about 200,000 short of projections, said Nick Sellers, chief executive of the World Games Organizing Committee. While expenses were lower than projected, the lack of revenue still caused a budget crunch, he said. More than 100 companies or individuals, many of them from Alabama, are owed about $15 million, officials said. Some area companies also complained about a decline in business during the event, which didn’t draw the expected number of international visitors during its run July 7-17. The Birmingham games marked only the second time a U.S. city played host to the World Games in its four-decade-long existence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. House candidate Tara Sweeney said Tuesday that she plans to end her campaign, saying she does not see a path to victory or to raise the resources needed to be successful in the November general election. Sweeney was positioned in fourth place after last week’s U.S. House primary as elections officials continued to count ballots. But she was far behind the top finishers, Democrat Mary Peltola and Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, who were already poised to advance to the November general election. An election process approved by voters in 2020 calls for the top four vote-getters in a primary to advance to the general election, in which ranked-choice voting will be used. Tiffany Montemayor, a spokesperson with the state Division of Elections, said if a candidate who advances from the primary withdraws 64 or more days before the general election, the fifth-place candidate would advance instead. She said that determination would come after the Sept. 5 withdrawal deadline. Peltola, Palin and Begich also were the three candidates competing in last week’s ranked-choice special election that will determine who serves the remainder of the late U.S. Rep. Don Young’s term, which ends early next year. The results of that election aren’t expected until Aug. 31.\n\nArizona\n\nMarana: A massive, beloved cactus has fallen. “Strong-Arm,” a saguaro that stood in the Tortolita Preserve in Marana near Tucson, fell Aug.4 after living for roughly 150 to 200 years, the town said on its website. The 40-foot-tall saguaro, marked with its own metal sign proclaiming its name, had 34 arms in all and was home to many birds, including a great horned owl and some woodpeckers. In the memorial post on Marana’s government website, Jason Grodman, natural resources supervisor with the Marana Parks and Recreation Department, called it a “saguaro motel” to its many animal residents. “It saw all of the development grow up around us, and it’s really a sentinel for the preserve,” Grodman said in a tribute video for the plant. Marana’s recreation superintendent Bob Stinson said his predecessor had given the saguaro its name since it was one of the largest cacti in the area, and the trail went right by it. “It was just a beautiful specimen,” Stinson said. He said, gauging from the many people he had spoken to about it, Strong-Arm would be missed in the community. Grodman said in the video that the trunk of the saguaro, which remains upright, will likely stand for the next few years, while the arms will likely decompose of the course of about five years.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: The attorney for a man seen on video being punched and kneed by officers said Tuesday that the violent arrest is part of an alleged pattern of excessive force by a sheriff’s deputy, and policing experts said some of the blows appeared to be unjustified or even criminal. A bystander’s video of 27-year-old Randal Worcester’s arrest Sunday in the small town of Mulberry sparked outrage after it was posted online. All three officers were later suspended, and state and federal authorities have opened criminal investigations into their actions. It’s the latest case in which increasingly omnipresent cameras have led to consequences for officers and raised questions about what level of force police are justified in using and when. A deputy was caught in the video repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down as a third also kneed him over and over. Carrie Jernigan, an attorney for Worcester, said the deputy who punched him, Levi White, used excessive force against other people she’s representing. “There’s something going on, and we just need to get it addressed,” she said during a Tuesday news conference with the two other clients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Victims who receive unsolicited sexually graphic material by text, email, app or other electronic means could sue the sender under a bill that lawmakers sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. The bill targets what’s known as “cyber flashing,” when victims receive such unwelcome surprises, often from strangers. “Just as individuals suffer sexual harassment and abuse in their physical, non-digital lives, there’s a growing incidence of individuals being harassed by receiving unsolicited, sexually explicit images and videos including from people they do not know,” Democratic Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry said when the Assembly approved the bill. The Assembly passed the measure 76-0 last Thursday, and the Senate sent the bill to Newsom on a 37-0 roll call Monday. There was no recorded opposition. The most common recipients are young women, Aguiar-Curry said. The Pew Research Center in a report last year on online harassment found that 33% of women under 35 had been sexually harassed online – three times as often as men. In a 2017 report, the center said more than half of women ages 18-29 had been sent unsolicited explicit images, as had 37% of men in the same age range. The bill would allow recipients to recover at least $1,500 and as much as $30,000 from senders of obscene material.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Colorado businessman charged in a “We Build the Wall” fraud case that once included former presidential adviser Steve Bannon among defendants wants his October retrial moved from New York to Colorado to save money and spare him from what his lawyer says is bias from political polarization he’ll otherwise face. Attorney John Meringolo wrote in papers submitted to a Manhattan federal court judge late Monday that Timothy Shea cannot get a fair and impartial retrial in New York. He also asked that the retrial be moved from Oct. 24 to early December, saying prosecutors have recently produced a previously seized laptop computer taken from Shea’s Castle Rock, Colorado, residence that contains an email exchange not introduced at the first trial, which ended in June with a deadlocked jury. In requesting a change of venue, Meringolo cited what he called the “obviously politically charged atmosphere of the jury room” at the first trial and said the effect of “political polarization” became obvious when the trial ended in a mistrial after 11 jurors tried to force one juror off the panel, saying he possessed political bias. A similar venue-change request was denied before Shea’s first trial. Meringolo said the first trial was an immense financial burden for his client, and a move would enable him to have witnesses who live closer to Colorado testify on his behalf.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A department store security guard who was shot outside a mall was wounded when he struggled with an alleged shoplifter who pulled a handgun on him, according to an arrest warrant affidavit released Monday. The affidavit was released as Richard LaPlante was arraigned in court on attempted murder and other charges in connection with Friday’s shooting outside The Shoppes at Buckland Hills in Manchester. A judge kept the 30-year-old Windsor resident’s bail at $1 million. Tirso Polanco, a 27-year-old loss prevention officer at the Macy’s store at the mall, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized, police said. According to the affidavit, LaPlante fled the mall after the shooting and took a transit bus home. Police said they were able to track and identify him through mall and bus security cameras. LaPlante turned himself in to police Saturday. His next court date was set for Sept. 7. His lawyer, Ronald Johnson, said after Monday’s court hearing that LaPlante “feels bad” about the shooting.“We’re praying for the victim and hope that the victim is OK, and we’re praying for his family,” Johnson said. “And the most important thing is let the judicial process go through its process.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of prisoners has sued the state’s prison system and its private health care contractor, claiming they’ve been left to suffer chronic and sometimes debilitating pain after officials banned certain pain medicines. Aside from complaints involving the pandemic, the lawsuit is the first large-scale litigation filed against Centurion of Delaware, the private health care provider for the state’s prison system. Centurion won a $47 million contract to provide health care for those imprisoned by the state starting in 2020, taking over after years of complaints and scandals involving the prisons’ prior health care provider. The lawsuit names 24 plaintiffs. All but one are currently in a Delaware prison. They each claim that they suffer from chronic pain or nerve damage caused by a range of issues from gunshot wounds to things like degenerative joint and spinal conditions, pain that was treated by medications that were effectively banned by the prison in 2019, the lawsuit says. The suit claims that after that, inadequate alternatives were provided. In some cases, they were given psychiatric drugs or alternative methods such as “distraction” and yoga, which leave the prisoners suffering behind bars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A homeless encampment in Northwest D.C. was cleared Wednesday morning, leaving many people looking for a new location to live, WUSA-TV reports. The National Park Service closed Reservation 70 about 7 a.m. The closure was due to imminent threats to public health and safety from unsheltered encampments in the parks, National Mall and Memorial Parks Chief of Communications Mike Litterst said. The closure will allow for turf rehabilitation, cleaning and maintenance of the park area, and removal of rodent infestation. Fencing will enclose the park and will remain closed while the park is under restoration. There was no information on how long the people who were living there were notified ahead of the closure to make arrangements to relocate. The site is one of many encampments that have been closed to homeless residents in the district this year. Once an encampment is closed, the unhoused people who were living there typically migrate to a different one, which can cause overcrowding.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz as a toddler was intellectually and physically behind other children, which caused him to isolate himself and hit and bite to get what he wanted, a day care administrator and former neighbor testified Tuesday at his penalty trial for mass murder. He remained socially and behaviorally stunted through elementary school, a special education counselor also testified. Cruz’s attorneys began the second day of their defense by building on testimony that his birth mother’s cocaine and alcohol abuse during pregnancy left him severely brain-damaged, putting him on a road that led to him murdering 14 students and three staff members at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018. They are trying to persuade his jury to sentence him to life without parole instead of death. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to the murders, and the trial is only to determine his sentence. Prosecutors say no drugs were found in Cruz’s system at birth. The defense says that’s because his birth mother was put in a residential drug rehab program when she was six months pregnant, but the damage had been done. The defense is trying to overcome the prosecution’s case, which featured surveillance video of Cruz mowing down students and staff as he stalked a three-story building for seven-minutes, photos of the aftermath and a jury visit to the building.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMorrow: Two white Atlanta police officers who clashed with Rayshard Brooks acted reasonably during the 2020 encounter that ended with the 27-year-old Black man’s fatal shooting, a specially appointed prosecutor said Tuesday in announcing his decision not to pursue charges against them. Officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Brooks in June 2020, and Officer Devin Brosnan faced a “quickly evolving” situation when Brooks lunged and grabbed one of their Tasers during an arrest attempt, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia. “We did not look at this with 20/20 hindsight. Given the quickly changing circumstances, was it objectively reasonable that he used deadly force? And we conclude it was,” Skandalakis said. The shooting happened against the backdrop of heightened tensions and protests nationwide after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer less than three weeks prior. Sometimes-violent protests had largely subsided in Atlanta, but Brooks’ killing set off a new round of demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. Skandalakis said he believes context is important and acknowledged encounters between police and the African American community are sometimes “very volatile,” but he said he doesn’t believe race played a role in this instance.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A food distribution company has agreed to pay $90,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging a Black employee was subjected to racial slurs and racist references to slavery, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday. According to the lawsuit, a supervisor at Suisan Co.’s Hilo warehouse shouted racial slurs at the worker, who was fired after complaining to management. A manager who investigated also used a racial epithet during a meeting with the employee, the lawsuit said. During a second meeting, the manager and another supervisor made jokes about slavery, the lawsuit said. The commission alleged in the lawsuit filed last year in U.S. District Court in Honolulu that the man was later fired in retaliation for reporting the harassment. In addition to the money, Suisan agreed to measures to address and prevent discrimination, the commission said, including outlining an internal complaint process and providing anti-discrimination training. “Even though Hawaii is a racially and culturally diverse state, we continue to see race discrimination and harassment complaints filed with our agency in this region,” said Anna Park, regional attorney for the commission.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Tuesday called a special session of the Legislature beginning Sept. 1 to use the state’s projected $2 billion budget surplus for a record $500 million income tax rebate this year to help residents deal with increased food and gas prices due to inflation. The Republican governor also proposed an ongoing tax cut of more than $150 million annually by creating a corporate and individual flat tax rate of 5.8% starting next year. The first $2,500 of income for individuals and $5,000 for those filing jointly would be exempt from taxes. Finally, Little wants to bolster K-12 public schools and ongoing education with $410 million annually from sales taxes starting next year. Language in Little’s proclamation calling the special session cites high inflation, currently about 8.5%. “Idaho taxpayers and the education system are especially imperiled by the consequences of historic inflation,” Little’s proclamation said. The proposed bill already has enough co-sponsors in the 70-member House and 35-member Senate to make it to the governor’s desk for his signature. The Legislature would decide when it meets in regular session in January how to spend the education money. Of the $410 million, $330 million is proposed for K-12 and $80 million for ongoing education.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A former prison guard could face life in prison after a jury convicted him Tuesday of violating the civil rights of a 65-year-old inmate who died after correctional officers beat him in a lockup more than four years ago. The jury of six men and six women deliberated about three hours before returning guilty verdicts on five counts against ex-correctional Lt. Todd Sheffler, 54, of Mendon. Sheffler is the second ex-guard convicted in the death of Larry Earvin in May 2018. A separate jury convicted Alex Banta, 31, of similar charges in April. That jury could not reach a verdict on Sheffler, so the government tried him again. “The defense made a statement about the long, cruel arm of government,” assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene Miller said in his closing statement. “Todd Sheffler violated his training, violated the U.S. Constitution and allowed, participated in and covered up the brutal beating of a 65-year-old man, defenseless, a fellow citizen, handcuffed behind his back and lying on the cold, hard concrete floor. He was the long, cruel arm of government.” Like Banta, Sheffler was convicted of depriving Earvin of his civil rights, conspiracy to deprive civil rights, tampering with a witness, destruction or falsification of records and intimidation or force against a witness. The civil rights charges alone carry sentences of as much as life in prison.\n\nIndiana\n\nLakeville: Democrat Paul Steury has been confirmed as the party’s candidate for the special election to complete the congressional term of Republican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski following her death in a highway crash. Democratic precinct committee members from Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District confirmed Steury’s selection during a caucus vote Tuesday evening in Lakeville. “With Paul Steury, Democrats have an educator and proven community leader who is ready to fight climate change, create more good-paying jobs, and build a better tomorrow for Hoosiers across Indiana’s Second Congressional District,” Indiana Democratic Party Chair Mike Schmuhl said Tuesday night in a statement. Steury is a high school science teacher from Goshen and will face Republican Rudy Yakym and Libertarian William Henry. Yakym won a Republican caucus Saturday to replace Walorski on the November ballot after gaining the endorsement of Walorski’s husband. Yakym, an executive with Elkhart distribution company Kem Krest, will be a heavy favorite to win in the solidly Republican district. All three candidates are running both in the special election to complete Walorski’s term that ends in early January and the regular election for a full two-year term. Both elections will be on the November ballot.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is undertaking an ambitious project to survey the condition of every house in Des Moines. The Property Condition Survey intends to survey more than 50 neighborhoods and 96,000 houses across the city, officials said. The initiative employs coordinators to evaluate properties with a focus on safety, according to SuAnn Donovan, the city’s deputy director of Neighborhood Services. As a part of the survey, coordinators will survey the condition of each property’s roof, siding, windows, fence and gates, porch and balconies, and foundation. Properties are then ranked on a scale of one to five, with one indicating the property is in good condition and five indicating it is in need of repair, according to Donovan. The overall score will help the city and Invest DSM, a neighborhood revitalization project, decide where to invest in next, she said. The survey is being used in the development of a voluntary neighborhood assistance program coined “Improving Our Neighborhoods,” Donovan said. Between 2011 and 2021, developers, homeowners and businesses have invested $2.1 billion in the city’s downtown, supplemented by government tax breaks and incentives. She emphasized that the initiative is voluntary and that the city will not be issuing any violations in regard to the findings of the survey.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: An anti-abortion activist is now suing for a complete hand recount of an election in which voters soundly rejected a proposal to remove abortion rights from the state’s constitution. Mark Gietzen is representing himself in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Sedgwick County District Court after a nine-county hand recount that his supporters largely funded wrapped up over the weekend. Fewer than 100 votes changed out of more than 500,000 cast in those counties. The measure failed by about 165,000 votes statewide. Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab said in a news release that the recount results should “put to rest the unfounded claims of election fraud.” In the lawsuit, Gietzen alleges without evidence that votes statewide might have been vulnerable to the same type of programming error that initially switched results in a county commission race. The suit also seeks a revote “where necessary.” A judge quickly dismissed a lawsuit Gietzen filed before the election seeking to have ballot drop boxes removed across the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nJackson: In the wake of the worst flooding in eastern Kentucky memory, 59 Breathitt County residents have signed onto a lawsuit against Blackhawk Mining and a contracted company, Pine Branch Mining, alleging nearby strip mining operations amplified the flood damage. Ned Pillersdorf, a local attorney representing the plaintiffs, said a majority of those 59 residents are now homeless, and those who aren’t won’t have access to clean water for months. The mining operations were a “ticking time bomb ready to explode with any type of heavy rainfall,” the filing in Breathitt County Circuit Court alleges. Following the late July flooding, residents said they found fish on their property that would normally reside in the silt ponds of coal mining operations, which the plaintiffs say indicates failure on the part of the coal companies to properly maintain its silt ponds and overall operation. Kentucky Administrative Regulation 20:060 requires coal companies to keep any debris or water from its operation from escaping its property into non-permitted areas, such as the residences below. The filing also accuses the coal companies of failing to continuously reclaim strip mined land, as required under Kentucky Revised Statute 350.100, damaging residents’ water supply, and causing property damage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: About two dozen juvenile inmates at a troubled detention center won’t be moved to the notorious state penitentiary at Angola until at least the middle of next month, as a legal battle over their transfer plays out, officials said Tuesday. The juveniles are currently being held at the Bridge City Center for Youth in Jefferson Parish. Officials have long acknowledged issues at the center, which wasn’t designed to house certain high-risk inmates. There have been at least four escapes this year, as well as a riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. But the plan to move them to Angola has been sharply criticized by criminal justice advocates, former officials and parents of children currently held at the center, The Times-Picayune/The News Orleans Advocate reports. A federal lawsuit to block the state from moving forward with the transfer was filed Friday on behalf of a teenager currently held in Bridge City who is set to be transferred to Angola, the newspaper reports. The defendants in the case – which include Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Office of Juvenile Justice – and their attorneys said Tuesday that they would not transfer any of the inmates until at least Sept. 15. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s public defender system wants to more than double its budget to better represent people who can’t afford an attorney. The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services voted to recommend a $62.1 million budget next year. The proposal would open four public defender offices in the state and raise the hourly fee from $80 to $150 for court-appointed lawyers. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state, but the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine is suing the state, contending there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. The budget request, which will be considered by lawmakers, comes against a backdrop of states grappling with public defender systems across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Texas man was sentenced to six months in federal prison Tuesday for threatening a Maryland doctor who has been a prominent advocate for COVID-19 vaccines, a federal prosecutor said. Scott Eli Harris, 52, of Aubrey, Texas, pleaded guilty in February to threats transmitted by interstate communication. U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron announced the sentence, which will be followed by three years of supervised release, in a news release Wednesday. “While we are all entitled to our own opinion, no one has the right to threaten the life of someone because of race, national origin, or because of holding different views,” Barron said in a statement. “Threats like these will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” According to Harris’ plea agreement and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Harris sent a threatening message from his cellphone to the doctor. Court documents identify the doctor only as “Dr. L.W., who had been a vocal proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine.” Harris’ message included violent statements such as: “Never going to take your wonder drug. My 12 gauge promises I won’t. .… I can’t wait for the shooting to start.” Harris’ message also made reference to the doctor’s Asian American background and national origin.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nKingston: A project underway in the woods of coastal Massachusetts seeks to restore a 32-acre former Catholic summer camp on the banks of the Muddy Pond in Kingston to something closer to what it might have looked like before European colonization transformed it. Through the Wampanoag Common Lands, the Native Land Conservancy – the local Native group that received the donated forestland this year – envisions a natural environment filled with indigenous plants and animals where Wampanoags can practice cultural ceremonies and educate new generations in traditional ways. Ramona Peters, a Mashpee Wampanoag who founded the conservancy, said the effort is all the more meaningful because the land is some 5 miles from where Pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower established the English colony of Plymouth, near the remnants of a Wampanoag community wiped out by European disease. “This is basically where the first impact of colonization of this country happened,” she said. “It’s very significant that it’s been returned to us.” The Wampanoag Common Lands is part of a growing movement of Indigenous-led conservation efforts helping to preserve and reinvigorate Native culture and identity, said Beth Rose-Middleton, a professor at the University of California, Davis, focused on Native American environmental policy and conservation.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: University of Michigan researchers are studying how well people with autism spectrum disorder can detect road hazards, and they plan to assist the young motorists in sharpening their driving skills. The upcoming effort will be the second phase of a project funded by Ford Motor Co. that teams the Ann Arbor university with a local driving school. During phase one of the study, researchers found that students with autism spectrum disorder detected fewer hazards than control participants during simulated drives. But lead researcher Elise Hodges said some extra work behind the wheel did the trick. “Those folks that underwent training improved in two-thirds of hazards in the simulated drive,” said Hodges, a clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan’s neuropsychology program. Ann Arbor Academy, a school for students with learning and social differences, hosted driving lessons. Hodges designed the simulated drives and oversaw the study. Ford footed the bill. The goal, in part, was to provide an opportunity for those with autism spectrum disorder to improve their driving skills. “Many of them … would like to drive, but getting from wanting to drive and being able to drive are two different things,” she said. The individualized driving sessions planned for phase two are expected to start in a month or two, Hodges said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEden Prairie: A suburban Minneapolis mall resumed normal business hours Tuesday after a fatal shooting that had earlier locked down the shopping complex. Police responded to the Eden Prairie Center mall Monday night and found a man dead of what they said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooting happened in the Scheels sporting goods store, which also sells firearms. Police Chief Matt Sackett said it’s not clear whether the man brought a weapon to Scheels or accessed one of the store’s guns. “It’s obviously an active and fluid investigation, but again, we do believe it to be an isolated incident. There is not a threat to anybody else in the public,” Sackett said at a briefing. Will Dammann was shopping in Scheels when he heard an alarm sound and a commotion near a door. Seconds later a store announcement told people to evacuate immediately. “So then it was, you know, the hustle bustle of getting out. Then everyone was just standing out in front, and that’s when the police just started rolling in,” Dammann said. He said people seemed calm, including store employees. He did not hear a gunshot, Minnesota Public Radio News reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nLorman: The Honors Curriculum Program at Alcorn State University is being renamed in honor of Myrlie Evers-Williams. The program will be renamed the Myrlie Evers-Williams Honors Program in recognition of the civil rights leader, author and journalist who spent over three decades seeking justice for the 1963 murder of her former husband, Medgar Evers, the university said in a news release. Evers-Williams attended Alcorn A&M College for a year, and there she met and fell in love with Medgar Evers. The two later married in 1951. Alcorn said the honors program attracts academically successful and socially conscious students and assists the university in cultivating global citizen scholars. Evers-Williams expressed her appreciation to the school for recognizing her. “This designation is a special recognition that I hold close to my heart, acknowledging my time on Alcorn’s campus, my life’s work, and my dedication to furthering the fight for equality and human rights,” she said. Alcorn President Dr. Felecia M. Nave praised Evers-Williams’ achievements and said she was proud to recognize the civil rights leader on campus. “She’s an ideal example of the strength, courage, and character that Alcornites exude. We’re thrilled to recognize her for extraordinary contributions and ongoing activism,” Nave said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: John Wood, a Republican running as an independent for U.S. Senate, announced Tuesday that he was withdrawing from the race. Wood said on Twitter that he decided not to challenge Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Democratic nominee Trudy Busch Valentine in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. Wood said he has significant differences with Schmitt and Valentine, but “it has become evident there is not a realistic path to victory for me as an independent candidate.” Wood, a lifelong Republican, former U.S. attorney and most recently a top investigator for the U.S. House committee examining the Jan. 6 riot, said he entered the race when disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens was the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He said it would have been “unacceptable” for Greitens to be Missouri’s new senator. Schmitt soundly defeated Greitens in the Aug. 2 GOP primary. Greitens resigned as governor four years ago after a sex scandal, two criminal charges that were eventually dropped and a legislative investigation that could have led to impeachment hearings. This year, his ex-wife accused him of abuse. Wood’s candidacy was backed by a political action committee led by retired Republican Sen. John Danforth, which spent millions on his campaign.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Visitors to the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls will have the unique opportunity Monday to get close to some of Montana’s most powerful predators: hawks, falcons and owls. Educational staff from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks will be in the city with two or three live “ambassador birds” in conjunction with FWP’s Montana WILD program. Three 40-minute programs will give attendees an up-close encounter with the birds, along with insights into what makes raptors unique from other types of birds, why they are so important to our ecosystems, and simple things property owners and recreationalists can do to protect and conserve raptors. “The mission of the ambassador bird program to educate and hopefully get people interested in the outdoors and what we’re doing in terms of conservation,” said Ali Pons, of FWP’s Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. The Montana WILD program is an outgrowth of the work being done at the center in Helena, which takes in injured and orphaned raptors for rehabilitation and release. Montana WILD cares for 15 ambassador birds too injured to be released on their own. “They wouldn’t make it,” Pons said of raptors who’ve become stars of the educational program. “They also have a personality and a demeanor that makes them good education birds.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge has dismissed the discrimination lawsuit of a former Lincoln Police Department spokeswoman, saying her allegations did not sufficiently prove a hostile work environment. Erin Spilker said in her lawsuit that she faced years of discrimination and that the department not only mishandled allegations of sexual assaults by male officers but also disciplined the women who complained. “She is under a microscope, and has been subjected to assaults, harassment, intimidation, threats and retaliation, which affect her ability to do her job,” Spilker’s attorney, Kelly Brandon, said in the complaint. In his order issued Monday, District Judge Kevin McManaman acknowledged Spilker’s string of allegations, from male colleagues making sexualized remarks about female colleagues to suffering various acts of retaliation after she complained, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. But McManaman said, citing case law, that the allegations amounted to “an amalgamation of discrete incidents … and not one unlawful employment practice.” The allegations “are not so similar in nature, frequency and severity as to be considered part and parcel of a hostile work environment,” McManaman wrote. Spilker, who was a 20-year veteran of the department before she resigned earlier this year, is among several female Lincoln police officers who have sued, alleging sex-based discrimination in the department.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new herd of wild horses is descending on the Black Rock Desert for 2022’s Burning Man festival. The Wild Horses of the American West project is rounding up more than a dozen life-size sculptures from local and international artists to bring awareness to environmental concerns surrounding the West’s wild horses. “Everyone loves horses. Wild horses are beautiful,” said organizer Adrian Landon. “But the bottom line is they need to be managed.” A longtime metalwork artist, Landon’s career has largely focused on equine sculptures. In 2019, he created “Wings of Glory,” a giant, flying Pegasus with moving parts now on display in England. This year, Landon had a vision of creating a herd of horses to bring awareness to the plight of Western ecosystems and the need to bring wildlife, plant life and water resources into balance. He put out a call to other artists interested in creating equine art and received dozens of replies. He selected 10 artists and used a grant from Burning Man to help fund their pieces. Now, the herd includes a sculpture from British artist Simon Bellamy, who fashioned a galloping steel piece based on the work of pioneering motion photographer Eadweard Muybridge, and Turburam Sandagdorj, a paper-cutting artist who learned the ancient art from his dad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Continuing with its efforts to close gaps and recover from missed learning, the state Department of Education has selected Tutor.com to provide 24/7 online tutoring for every middle and high school student in the state. Through the partnership, more than 100,000 middle and high school students will gain unlimited access to Tutor.com – anytime, anywhere, from any internet-connected device. The service will be available to students at all New Hampshire schools (public, non-public and charter), as well as students in Home Education and Education Freedom Account programs. “This tutoring will not only facilitate and enhance learning but serve as a tremendous resource for students hoping to enhance their educational experience, or those students in need of individualized instruction. This partnership will also support teachers in their ongoing efforts to assist students who may be struggling and seeking additional guidance,” said Frank Edelblut, the state education commissioner. School districts are being encouraged to register for Tutor.com’s free access for their students; students outside those districts will be able to register individually.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEdison: Mayor Sam Joshi said symbols of hate and discrimination are not welcome in the township, after a piece of construction equipment, viewed as a symbol of hate by the Muslim community, was featured in the Aug. 14 India Day Parade. The parade, from Edison to Woodbridge, marked the 75th anniversary of India’s independence and the division of the South Asian subcontinent into two nations, Hindu-oriented India and Muslim-oriented Pakistan, after years of civil strife. In a statement Monday, Joshi said Edison is committed to celebrating and working in harmony with people from all cultures. But an American-Islamic relations group said it’s disappointed the mayor has not gone further in rebuking the parade organizers, whom the group called to apologize. The parade, organized by the Indian Business Association, featured a piece of construction equipment with the photos of political leaders in India, who are described as proponents of hate against Muslims and other minorities, according to Azra Baig, chair of the South Brunswick’s Human Relations Commission. In India, Baig noted, homes, businesses and houses of worship are being bulldozed because of people’s faith and when they stand up for their rights. “Something this hateful should never be included in a parade in Edison,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state will no longer deny licenses to practice law solely because of an applicant’s citizenship or immigration status, including some aspiring law students who arrived in the U.S. as children and don’t have a clear path to citizenship. Announced Monday, the rule change from the New Mexico Supreme Court is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. Several states already have provisions that disregard residency or immigration status in licensure decisions. “The change in the licensure rule is grounded in the fundamental principle of fairness, and is consistent with New Mexico’s historical values of inclusion and diversity,” Supreme Court Chief Justice Shannon Bacon said in a statement Tuesday. She said the shift aligns New Mexico with recommendations by the American Bar Association and provisions in at least eight other states that provide attorney licensing to some immigrants. All applicants are still required to graduate from law school, pass the bar exam and undergo further character vetting by a board of bar examiners. The rulemaking drew immediate criticism from state Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce, at a time when GOP candidates are challenging two incumbent state Supreme Court justices in the November general election.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is headed to Harvard this fall as a teaching fellow at the university’s schools of government and public health. De Blasio, a Democrat who served as mayor from 2014 to 2021, will take part in “a variety of discussions, events, and programming” at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School and will teach classes on leadership and public service at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the schools said in separate announcements Wednesday. Dean Michelle A. Williams cited the former mayor’s time grappling with public health crises including COVID-19, homelessness and the opioid epidemic. Setti Warren, interim director of the Institute of Politics, said de Blasio’s “decades of experience in local government, federal agencies, national campaigns, and running the largest city in the country will provide invaluable insight to our students and the Harvard community.”De Blasio, who grew up in Massachusetts and is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, was prevented by term limits from seeking a third four-year term as mayor. After an unsuccessful campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, de Blasio flirted this year with running for governor of New York and later mounted a brief run for a congressional district that includes his Brooklyn home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A federal appeals court on Tuesday blocked a local district attorney from prosecuting state Attorney General Josh Stein or anyone else for his 2020 campaign ad through a criminal libel law. The majority of a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, granted the request by Stein’s campaign committee and others associated with his campaign to prevent enforcement of the law while they sue to attempt to have the law overturned as unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision came the day after a Wake County grand jury formally asked the Wake district attorney’s office to submit an indictment against Stein and two of his advisers or any one of the three for jurors to consider. Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman said Monday that could have happened as soon as next month. Any formal charges could harm the political future of Stein, a Democrat and possible 2024 gubernatorial candidate. The law, which dates back to at least 1931, makes it a misdemeanor to circulate “derogatory reports” about a candidate with the intent of hurting that candidate’s chances in the election. Stein’s Republican opponent in 2020, Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill, cited the law while demanding that the board investigate a political ad that accused the Republican of letting more than a thousand rape kits go untested. O’Neill said the ad was false because police agencies, not prosecutors, are responsible for testing the kits.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A school board reversed course on its decision to stop reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at its monthly meetings, following complaints from conservative lawmakers and an angry backlash from citizens around the country. Seven of the nine members of the Fargo Board of Education, including four newcomers who took office in June, voted earlier this month to cancel a previous board edict that was approved a couple of months before the election. The new board agreed with member Seth Holden, who said the pledge did not align with the district’s diversity and inclusion code in part because the phrase “under God” does not include all faiths. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum last week promoted new legislation that would require public schools and governing bodies to administer the pledge without mandating that people recite it. Republican state Rep. Pat Heinert, a retired county sheriff, is suggesting that sanctions be put in place for public boards and commissions that don’t require the patriotic oath. Angry emails and voicemails dominated Thursday’s special meeting to reconsider the vote. Nyamal Dei, a refugee who fled war-torn Sudan, played a profanity-laced voicemail from a man who called her a slave, racist and Nazi. Several board members apologized to Dei, the lone Black member on the board, for taking the worst of the abuse. Dei said reversing the decision would be giving in to hate. She paused for several seconds before casting the lone “no” vote to reinstate the pledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A strike by teachers in the state’s largest school district entered its third day Wednesday – the first day of school for some 47,000 students, with some of those students and their parents rallying to their sides. Parents, students, teachers and other employees gathered at schools across the Columbus School District with plans to picket for hours, advocating for safer buildings, better heating and air conditioning, smaller class sizes, and a more well-rounded curriculum that includes art, music and physical education. It’s the union’s first strike in the district since 1975. Picketers blasted music on the sidewalks outside Whetstone High School in Columbus and waved to honking drivers. Some held up signs reading:“Columbus schools deserve working air,” “a history lesson in progress,” and “my feet hurt but I’ll walk as long as it takes.” The school district and the union resumed bargaining Wednesday afternoon. The school board said its offer to the union put children first. The Ohio Education Association said more than 94% of the Columbus Education Association members voted to reject the school board’s final offer late Sunday. The union represents more than 4,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and other employees, though it isn’t clear how many of those 4,000 members were not on the job Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday rejected clemency for a man facing execution Thursday for the 1997 hammer killing of a Choctaw man, despite a recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that his life be spared. James Coddington was convicted and sentenced to die for the beating death of a friend and co-worker, 73-year-old Albert Hale, inside Hale’s Choctaw home. Prosecutors say Coddington, who was 24 at the time, became enraged when Hale refused to give him money to buy cocaine. Coddington’s execution is scheduled for Thursday morning. “After thoroughly reviewing arguments and evidence presented by all sides of the case, Governor Kevin Stitt has denied the Pardon and Parole Board’s clemency recommendation for James Allen Coddington,” Stitt’s office said in a statement. During a clemency hearing this month before the state’s five-member Pardon and Parole Board, an emotional Coddington, now 50, apologized to Hale’s family and said he is a different man today. “I’m clean; I know God; I’m not … I’m not a vicious murderer,” Coddington told the board. “If this ends today with my death sentence, OK.” Coddington’s attorney, Emma Rolls, said Coddington doesn’t have any pending appeals that would delay or stop his execution Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: The Klamath Irrigation District in southern Oregon plans to defy a U.S. government order issued last week for a halt to water deliveries to farmers in the drought-stricken basin. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation manages the Klamath Project, which includes Klamath Irrigation District and serves 266 square miles of farmland around the Oregon-California border. A limited allocation of water was allowed for irrigators from Upper Klamath Lake this year because of extreme drought. The bureau has said the project is now out of water and ordered a shutdown last week, but irrigation district directors met Monday and authorized the district’s manager, Gene Souza, to continue operations, the Capital Press reports. The district operates a canal that provides water to nine irrigation districts encompassing about 191 square miles. Souza said in a letter to Alan Heck, acting area manager for the U.S. agency, that it has not provided a legal basis for shutting down the project and that doing so would deny farmers of the water they have legal rights to receive. “I am not doing my duty if I just comply because I do not have a legal justification to deny the people I serve their property,” Souza told the Capital Press.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State elections officials said Wednesday that a push last week to recruit new poll workers produced more than 1,100 applicants, including at least one in 58 of 67 counties. The effort tied to Help America Vote Day, organized by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, brought in the most applicants in some of the populous suburbs of Philadelphia – 221 in Montgomery County, 132 in Chester and 91 in Delaware. Allegheny County, which encompasses Pittsburgh, drew 100 applicants, while Philadelphia brought in 47. In central Pennsylvania, Lancaster received 71 applications, Dauphin 40 and Cumberland 39. Poll workers, often older people, are paid to help run elections in some 9,000 polling places across the state, but it has been a challenge to recruit and train sufficient numbers of them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Poll worker shortages predate the pandemic, however, in part because their work can require 14- or 16-hour days. Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said the influx of 1,146 new candidates was a welcome boost. Some counties promoted the recruitment drive last week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new report suggests ways the city can atone for its extensive ties to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and centuries of racism and discrimination by, among other things, establishing home repair funds, launching financial literacy programs, and boosting aid to Black and Indigenous organizations. The report, issued Monday by the Providence Municipal Reparations Commission, notably doesn’t recommend giving out direct payments to Black and Native American residents, as some had called for. Instead, it defines “reparations” as efforts that close the “present-day racial wealth and equity gaps,” and it outlines 11 areas for the city to focus its reparations work, including criminal justice reform, neighborhood development, health equity, and improving educational and cultural opportunities. Providence’s reparations effort was launched the same year Rhode Island voters approved a ballot referendum getting rid of the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name because of its slavery connotations. The new report suggests creating a dedicated fund to support residents touched by urban renewal policies that displaced and negatively affected communities of color. It also calls for forgiving certain municipal court debts; ending police use of so-called no-knock warrants; decriminalizing consumption of alcohol in public; and creating a school curriculum based on the city’s research into its racist and discriminatory policies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A showdown between defense attorneys for disbarred lawyer Alex Murdaugh who say prosecutors are unfairly withholding evidence and prosecutors who want the defense to agree to secrecy rules first is heading for a courtroom next week. In their latest court filing, defense lawyers said the secrecy rules as Murdaugh awaits a murder trial in the shooting deaths of his wife and younger son are hypocritical because prosecutors are leaking evidence to media outlets, including a video the leaker said was taken not long before the killings. Prosecutors, including South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson himself, denied the leaks last week. A hearing about the matter is scheduled for Monday at the Colleton County courthouse, where defense attorneys want the murder trial to take place in January. The cellphone video from Murdaugh’s son included Murdaugh talking to his wife outside the family’s Colleton County home where the killings happened, said defense lawyers, who said they hadn’t been given the video, but it was shown to Murdaugh’s family by state agents. The leaked media reports did not include that the conversation was friendly and about dogs, the defense said. Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian said the state contends that Murdaugh killed his wife and son “for no apparent reason” within minutes of the light-hearted conversation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota is joining other states in filing an amicus brief in defense of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The friend of the court brief involves the U.S. Supreme Court case Brackeen v. Haaland, which challenges the act that establishes federal standards for placement of Native American children in foster of adoptive homes. The act seeks to give the child’s family and tribe the opportunity to be involved in decisions from which they previously may have been excluded, including placement and services. Arguments in the case are scheduled before the high court this November. Stephanie Amiotte, legal director for the South Dakota ACLU, said if the court overturns the law, it could be devastating for tribes. “ICWA was enacted by Congress to address a situation where disproportionate numbers of Indian children were being removed from their homes, and eventually a disproportionate number of them were being adopted into white families,” Amiotte told South Dakota Public Broadcasting. The act’s opponents say the race-based policy is unconstitutional. Amiotte said keeping Indigenous children connected to their culture improves outcomes. “Native American Children have been essentially invisible within the American society,” Amiotte said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The superintendent of the state’s largest school district has resigned as he was being investigated by an outside attorney for allegations that he abused his power and violated policies. The Shelby County School Board accepted the resignation of Joris Ray during a specially called meeting Tuesday evening, officials said in a news release. Ray was appointed to lead Memphis-Shelby County Schools in 2019, and he had worked in the district for more than 24 years. The board had suspended Ray during an investigation stemming from allegations made in divorce proceedings between Ray and his wife, who is also a school district employee. A board resolution says it took action “to review the allegations to determine whether Superintendent Ray, during his tenure as Superintendent, engaged in relationships with District employees violative of MSCS policies.” The investigation was being led by former U.S. Attorney Edward L. Stanton III. In a statement posted on Twitter, Ray thanked colleagues for their “many, many small but powerful acts of devotion and commitment.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Texas officials have accused the state’s most populous county of defunding some of its law enforcement agencies in violation of a new law that prevents such funding cuts. In a letter sent Monday, Texas Comptroller Glen Hegar alleged leaders in Harris County, where Houston is located, reduced funding for the offices of its constables in the current fiscal year and would again reduce funding next year. Harris County officials pushed back against the claims they were defunding law enforcement, saying they have actually increased funding, proposing a budget for the next fiscal year that would allocate $1.4 billion for justice and safety – which is 75% of the county’s budget and the most ever allocated by the county for public safety. Hegar accused the county of ending a policy that would have let the constables’ offices automatically roll over unspent departmental funds from one fiscal year to the next, resulting in a loss of more than $3 million. He also accused the county of reducing funding for the constables by up to $12 million for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Constables and their deputies are licensed peace officers who have the same powers as regular police officers but also have the added responsibility of civil law enforcement.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican state leaders sued the Biden administration Wednesday over the president’s decision last year to restore two sprawling national monuments on rugged lands sacred to Native Americans that ex-President Donald Trump had downsized. The lawsuit over Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments alleges President Joe Biden’s action violates the authority granted in a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historically, geographically or culturally important. The legal argument has been repeated for years by Republicans, and the legal challenge had been expected since Biden made the move in October 2021. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a years­long debate spanning three presidential administrations about proper protections of lands that include ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. Trump’s decision to cut them in size opened them for mining and other development, although market dynamics kept that in check. “President Biden made no attempt to explain how 3.23 million acres constituted the ‘smallest area compatible with the proper care and management’ of these supposed monuments,” the lawsuit claims, citing the 1906 Antiquities Act outlining rules for designating national monuments.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A woman was attacked by a black bear over the weekend while walking her two dogs on trails on her Strafford property, the state Fish and Wildlife Department reported Tuesday. The 61-year-old woman was treated at Gifford Medical Center in Randolph on Saturday for non-life-threatening injuries, including a bite wound on her leg and multiple scratches, the department said. Fish and Wildlife game wardens and a bear biologist visited the site and concluded that the bear was a female with cubs who was likely provoked when the woman and her dogs surprised the group. They were unable to find the bear and say such attacks are extremely rare in the state. At the time of the attack, the woman had called her two dogs, who were out of sight, when she heard a large noise and realized a bear was charging her, officials said. She told game wardens that she tripped on a stone wall as the bear was charging her and then realized the animal was on top of her and had bitten her. The woman said her Jack Russell terrier barked at the bear, prompting the animal to get off her. She said she left with her dogs without seeing the bear again and called 911 when she got home. She also texted a neighbor to take her to the hospital.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A ratepayer protection that state regulators included in a recent order approving Dominion Energy Virginia’s application to build and recover the costs of a massive offshore wind farm would force the utility to scrap the project, Dominion said in a filing this week. The State Corporation Commission granted approval this month for the 176-turbine, multibillion-dollar project off Virginia Beach. Dominion immediately raised concerns about the commission’s inclusion of a performance guarantee for the wind farm and in a petition Monday asked the regulators to reconsider that element of their order. Dominion “shares the Commission’s concern, as expressed in the Final Order, that the Project be constructed and operated in a way that reasonably mitigates risk for its customers. The Commission’s unprecedented imposition of an involuntary performance guarantee condition on its approvals, however, is untenable,” the filing said. “As ordered, it will prevent the Project from moving forward, and the Company will be forced to terminate all development and construction activities.” The commission’s Aug. 5 order included three “consumer protections,” including the performance guarantee, which it said would protect customers who are paying for the wind farm “from also having to pay for replacement energy if the Project does not generate the amount of electricity upon which Dominion bases its request and its cost estimates.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An analysis of Washington State Ferries data shows ferries are running behind schedule this year more than they have in the past decade, with a consistent decline in on-time performance. Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling told The Seattle Times that with 50% more passengers traveling by ferry in the summer, it is not unusual to see a dip in on-time performance from June to September. But the delays are more pronounced this year, and passengers on the Anacortes/San Juans route face particular problems, according to WSF data. While this route usually records more delays than others, in June, nearly half of all sailings on this route ran behind schedule. The newspaper reports that was a 40 percentage point gap from WSF’s target to run on time for 95% of trips. WSF attributes the lower on-time performance to a staffing shortage and a higher number of passengers on busy routes. On weekends, especially holiday weekends like Labor Day, passengers on popular tourist routes such as Anacortes/San Juans and Port Townsend/Coupeville are more likely to face delays on Thursday and Friday afternoons leaving the Seattle area and returning on Sunday and Monday afternoons. As of July this year, WSF had a 6% decline in staffing since 2019, when it was running at full capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A cleanup project is planned for the Kanawha River next month. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan is sponsoring the 32nd annual Great Kanawha River Cleanup from 8 a.m. to noon Sept. 10. Cleanup sites will be in Kanawha, Putnam and Fayette counties. Anyone who wants to volunteer should register with the department at (800) 322-5530 or christopher.j.cartwright@wv.gov. Bags and gloves will be provided for volunteers, and REAP will arrange for the trash to be hauled away. Volunteers will receive a T-shirt. Last year, 59 volunteers helped remove 1.9 tons of litter and 301 tires from five sites along the Kanawha River.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has rejected a motion by the Milwaukee Police Department that sought to dismiss a case brought by two city residents who claimed their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested near a memorial site for a Black man fatally shot by an officer in 2016. The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin is representing the residents, including Jarrett English and a plaintiff who did not wish to be named. They were arrested Aug. 30, 2016, in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood, where police killed Sylville Smith approximately two weeks earlier. The 23-year-old Smith, who was armed, was running from police who suspected him of dealing drugs. The officer who killed Smith, also Black, was acquitted in the fatal shooting. Smith’s death touched off days of rioting in which businesses were burned, including a gas station, an auto parts store and a beauty supply shop. Firefighters were held back from the gas station blaze because of gunfire. The two plaintiffs, in their 2019 lawsuit, said their rights to the freedoms to assemble and to express themselves were violated when police in riot gear cleared Smith’s memorial site and arrested each of them at separate locations in the neighborhood.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The rush to build wind farms to combat climate change is colliding with preservation of one of the West’s most spectacular predators – the golden eagle – as the species teeters on the edge of decline. Ground zero in the conflict is Wyoming, a stronghold for golden eagles that soar on 7-foot wings and a favored location for wind farms. As wind turbines proliferate, scientists say deaths from collisions could drive down golden eagle numbers considered stable at best. Yet climate change looms as a potentially greater threat to the species: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce golden eagle breeding ranges by more than 40% later this century, according to a National Audubon Society analysis. That leaves golden eagles doubly vulnerable – to the shifting climate and to the wind energy promoted as a solution to that warming world. “We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming, but it doesn’t mean the population is not at risk,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, Wyoming. “As we increase wind development across the U.S., that risk is increasing.” Turbines blades hundreds of feet long are among myriad threats to golden eagles, which are routinely shot, poisoned by lead, hit by vehicles and electrocuted on power lines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/24/schools-alice-cooper-muhammad-alis-gym-goldblum-vs-plastic-news-around-states/41053459/", "title": "School's in with Alice Cooper, Muhammad Ali's gym, Goldblum vs ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city has kicked off a new anti-littering campaign. Mayor Randall Woodfin and community leaders in the Bush Hills neighborhood on Tuesday announced the Don’t be a D.U.M.M.Y. campaign – “Dumping Ugly Mess in My Yard.” The mayor and people in various Birmingham communities are tired of illegal trash dumping, WBRC-TV reports. “People are too comfortable dumping in our city. Whether they live here or bring it into the city, we want to make something clear and simple for folks: That is illegal,” Woodfin said. He wants residents to report any illegal dumping by calling 311. They can take video or pictures of people or their vehicles and go to the city magistrate’s office to sign out warrants for their arrest, he urged. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine. For a second or subsequent offense, it doubles to $1,000.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A federal appeals court has reversed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by four men who contend they were illegally imprisoned for nearly two decades. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by the “Fairbanks Four” against the city, KTVF-television reports. George Frese, Kevin Pease, Marvin Roberts and Eugene Vent were convicted of murder in the 1997 death of Fairbanks teenager John Hartman. The men spent 18 years in prison while they asserted their innocence and appealed their convictions. After a five-week hearing that re-examined the cases in detail and presented the case that others killed Hartman, the convictions were vacated in December 2015. The four men sued the city for wrongful imprisonment and said an agreement that led to their release, in which they agreed not to sue, was not legally binding because they were coerced.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Center is expanding into the city. The legendary rocker and his wife, Sheryl Cooper, were at Westwood High School on Wednesday to announce a partnership with Mesa Public Schools. They projected a summer 2020 opening of a second Solid Rock Teen Center in a former elementary school downtown. Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Centers will fund the renovations and provide more than $100,000 worth of music, arts and dance programming to youth ages 12 to 20 and the local community. The Mesa center grew out of the Hall of Famer’s annual Rock & Roll Fundraising Bash at Las Sendas Golf Club in east Mesa. The original Solid Rock Teen Center opened in 2012 in Phoenix, built in partnership with Genesis Church and Cooper’s Solid Rock Foundation after more than a decade of fundraising.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: Residents celebrated a street being renamed in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. this week after months of contentious debate. About 100 people gathered Monday at the intersection of Commerce and Highland Drives to witness a new street sign’s unveiling after a parade and program on Arkansas State University’s campus to commemorate King’s legacy. “The question is asked occasionally, do we still need to celebrate Dr. King’s holiday? If you followed the efforts this year to get a street name in the honor of Dr. King in Jonesboro and some of the language used in the debate and editorials, you realize there still remains a need for programs like this,” the Rev. Ray Scales said. Emma Agnew, president of Craighead County’s National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, encouraged the audience to register to vote at the event, asking them to consider those who died fighting for the right to vote and to take their legacy seriously.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A push to pass first-in-the-nation proposals to limit single-use plastic containers and other items drew support from actor Jeff Goldblum on Wednesday. Environmental groups hail California’s proposal as a landmark attempt to cut down on 75% of waste from plastic items like takeout boxes, food containers and utensils. The bills aim to achieve the target within a decade. “I feel like we’re on the brink of accomplishing something,” Goldblum said, likening the proposal to President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 moon-shot speech. The two bills, one in the Assembly and another in the Senate, would require companies to reduce single-use packaging as much as possible by 2024 and ensure products made or imported into California after 2030 are recyclable or can be composted. Goldblum and advocates met with representatives from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office and lawmakers at the Capitol. They delivered signed letters of support from January Jones, Ted Danson, and other actors and activists.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Immigration and customs officials violated federal law by refusing to release documents about people who are not citizens, a Colorado federal court judge said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used the rule to deny the release of records at least 333 times between July 2017 and April 2019, The Denver Post reports. The court ordered ICE to change its nationwide standard operating procedure and comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The case started in 2013 in Glenwood Springs when attorney Jennifer Smith requested documents about her client, but ICE refused to release them because the client was deemed a fugitive, authorities said. Releasing the documents could help people evade immigration enforcement, ICE officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new economic action plan will be rolled out in the state that will include incentives to attract employers to its cities and promote the growth of women- and minority-owned businesses, according to a top state official. David Lehman, commissioner of economic and community development, announced a strong push will be coming to create hubs of innovation in the manufacturing, health care, insurance and bio-science industries, the Hartford Courant reports. Lehman said there is an effort to focus these innovations in cities and strengthen networks that will be enough for Connecticut to become competitive among larger cities like Boston and New York. Since the last recession, the state has struggled to regain jobs, with the latest count showing just 85% have been added back. Lehman said Gov. Ned Lamont will roll out a plan in the coming weeks that he hopes will answer and resolve a lot of the state’s economic and development issues.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A proposal by Democratic state lawmakers to outlaw homemade “ghost guns,” which can’t be traced by law enforcement agents because they don’t have serial numbers or are fashioned from parts created with 3D printers, has cleared its first legislative hurdle. A Democrat-led House committee voted to release the bill Wednesday after an hourlong public hearing, although its chief sponsor, House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, said she plans to amend the bill after meeting Tuesday with representatives of the National Rifle Association. Longhurst said her amendments would include a phase-in date by which owners of existing guns would have to obtain serial numbers for their weapons, exempting muzzle loaders and replicas of antique firearms, and allowing licensed firearms dealers to legally handle gun parts that do not have serial numbers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Despite months of protest from students, faculty and parents, the chancellor for D.C. Public Schools announced Thursday that Washington Met will close at the end of the school year, WUSA-TV reports. The news prompted a group of students to walk out of class Thursday morning in protest, chanting “Save Washington Met!” and carrying signs noting, “School closures disproportionately happen to black and brown communities.” Chancellor Lewis Ferebee’s originally announcement Nov. 26 of a proposal to close the school was met with outrage from some stakeholders. He cited low enrollment and achievement compared to DCPS’ three other opportunity academies. The district hosted two community forums to gather feedback and gave the public a chance to provide input until Dec. 20, which critics said was not nearly enough time.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state House on Wednesday moved to repeal a powerful commission charged with placing constitutional amendments before voters. On a 93-25 vote, the House sent the joint resolution to the Senate. If the Senate also approves, it would send the matter to voters in November. The Constitution Revision Commission was established in 1968 and meets once every 20 years to consider measures to put before the state’s electorate. “Maybe it served a valid purpose at one time,” said Rep. Brad Drake, a Republican. “Their purpose was to make revisions to the constitution, not to become policy makers – that’s our job.” The commission last met in 2018 and placed seven measures on the ballot – all of which were approved by voters. Among those was a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling and vaping in enclosed indoor workplaces. Another measure barred public officials from lobbying for compensation while in office and six years thereafter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Proposed budget cuts could mean fewer state troopers on the road, fewer lawyers defending poor people and fewer probation officers, state agency heads told lawmakers Wednesday as budget hearings continued. Gov. Brian Kemp has proposed overall increases to the state budget, mostly based on higher pay for teachers; increased funding for K-12 schools, colleges and universities; and higher spending on the state-federal Medicaid health insurance program. But Kemp has proposed more than $200 million in cuts to other agencies for the remainder of the current budget year and more for the budget year beginning July 1. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough told lawmakers he would leave 55 trooper positions open in the 2021 budget year and warned that “a reduction in troopers on the roadways equates to an increase in fatalities.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Solid Waste Advisory Committee in the state has proposed a plan that includes 82 waste management recommendations covering nine programs. The committee also heard recommendations at a public hearing in Hilo on Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports. The committee made recommendations including to conduct public awareness campaigns, regularly review the West Hawaii Sanitary Landfill contract and conduct more household hazardous waste collection events, officials said. Some residents also made recommendations to the committee. “The key approach to landfill reduction is public education,” said Melody Euaparadorn of Zero Waste Big Island. Members of the Sierra Club’s Hawaii Island Group said the committee should enact a disposal fee on all purchased products at the point of purchase, an environmental impact fee on tourists and negotiations for an end date with Waste Management Inc., which operates the West Hawaii landfill.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s residents wouldn’t have to fall back or spring ahead for daylight saving time under legislation introduced Thursday. The House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce the measure brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. She said the twice-a-year time change was a safety hazard that caused temporary jet lag leading to injuries among motorists and pedestrians. She said it also increased the chances of strokes and heart attacks. Zito introduced similar legislation last year, but it failed in the full House on a 55-15 vote. A similar fate is expected this year, and there was some mirth among lawmakers on the committee. “At this point, it seems like the only one who can mess with time is God,” said Rep. Vito Barbieri, who is in favor of ending daylight saving time and moved to approve introducing the bill. “We’re going to try again.” Zito acknowledged getting the bill signed is a long shot but said it’s high on the list of what her roral constituents want.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Grant funds will provide nearly $30 million for efforts across the state to acquire open spaces and develop and improve recreational facilities. Gov. J.B. Pritzker released the list of 85 projects late last week. They will receive $29.7 million from the Open Space Land Acquisition and Development program through the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. “Investments in local park projects are good for families and recreation enthusiasts, helping them enjoy outdoor activities and making Illinois communities better places to live and work,” Pritzker said in a statement. OSLAD money supports up to half of a project’s cost. With local matching funds, the grant awards will cover $56 million in park developments and open-space land purchases. OSLAD, begun in 1987, receives funding from a portion of the state’s Real Estate Transfer Tax.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: Work is underway for a war memorial that was delayed for years by the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis. Crews began clearing trees last week in Crown Point for the memorial, which will feature three separate monuments: one for World War I veterans, another for World War II veterans and one for victims of the Holocaust. The two war memorials will be placed at opposite ends of a long walkway lined with plaques with information giving visitors a clearer understanding of the events between the two wars, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Mitch Barloga, president of the Friends of Veterans Memorial Parkway, says the goal is to have the memorial finished by 2021 or no later than 2022.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will become the latest to create an organization within state government designed to prevent school shootings under a plan announced Tuesday by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Reynolds said she’s creating a Governor’s School Safety Bureau within the Iowa Department of Public Safety. It would cost $2 million to start and $1.5 million annually to operate, and Reynolds said she’s included needed funding in her legislative budget request. “News headlines about school shootings and threats at unsuspecting communities across America are becoming all too common,” she said. “Although those headlines don’t often involve schools in Iowa, we can’t wait until they do to act.” Full-time bureau instructors will train local law enforcement officers and school staff in identifying and responding quickly in a consistent way. Reynolds’ plan calls for hiring two additional state agents with cyber training to identify and address early threats.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The family of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon, has donated two items that were aboard the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 to the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson. Armstrong’s two sons donated a 4-by-6-inch U.S. flag and a small piece of fabric from the wing of the Wright Flyer, the first flying machine built by the Wright brothers, the museum announced Wednesday. The piece of fabric was in the lunar module when it touched down on the moon, the museum said. Neil Armstrong died in 2012. “When I visited the Cosmosphere in 2019, it was clearly a world-class space museum, but I didn’t see anything from Apollo 11 (mission) on exhibit, and it seemed obvious to me that they should have something from the flight,” Rick Armstrong said in a news release. The new donations will be put on display later this year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: People passing by the gym where Muhammad Ali learned to box can see a new historical marker that has been placed there. The Columbia Gym at Spalding University also has a red bicycle hanging over the entrance to the gym. Ali’s red bike was stolen when he was young, leading him to a police officer who trained at the gym. Officer Joe Martin told Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, that he would have to learn to fight, and Clay started training at the same gym. News outlets report the marker was unveiled last week, the day before Ali would have turned 78. He died in 2016. Ali’s brother, Rahman Ali, helped unveil the marker. He said his brother’s “whole life” started at Columbia Gym.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A historic brewery that’s been shuttered since Hurricane Katrina will officially reopen in a new location this weekend. Dixie Brewery plans to hold a grand opening Saturday, news outlets report. It originally opened in 1907. Floods and looting after the hurricane contributed to its closure, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. The new facility is open to the public and boasts a bar, cafe, outdoor space, museum and games. The brewery will also offer tours showing parts of the production process, according to news outlets. The brewery has created jobs for more than 40 people, WVUE-TV reports. The general manager said he hopes the facility becomes a landmark for people visiting New Orleans. “I mean, if you go to Cafe Du Monde for a beignet, you have to come to Dixie for a beer,” Jim Birch said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor used her first State of the State address this week to paint a picture of the Pine Tree State as a home of compromise and bipartisanship in an era marked by political gridlock elsewhere. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills themed Tuesday’s address “We are not Washington; we are Maine” and stuck to a theme of working together to improve health care access, protect the environment and grow the economy. Mills, who has used her first year in office to focus on issues such as Medicaid expansion, tackling climate change and solving the state’s opioid crisis, also ticked off accomplishments that she said show Maine is in good hands. “We have made progress, and we have done so without rancor or bitterness,” Mills told the crowd in the Maine House of Representatives chambers, also touting “the security and saneness of our own small outpost” during the state’s bicentennial year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A new report says a critical shortage of police officers in the city is delaying many of the reforms that are required under a federal consent decree. The report was authored by an independent monitoring team of policing and civil rights experts, according to the Baltimore Sun. The team wrote that staffing challenges will have staggering effects on overall reforms. The department finished 2019 with 31 fewer officers than it had when the year began. A consultant recently concluded the department needs to hire 300 more officers and 100 civilians to adequately staff areas such as patrol and internal affairs. The consent decree – which followed a federal investigation that found officers routinely violated residents’ civil rights, particularly in black neighborhoods – requires improvements in how police interact with youths and respond to residents with mental disabilities as well as sexual assault victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSwansea: A Target employee who faced criticism by a customer upset over the price of a toothbrush received more than $30,000 in donations for a vacation fund. Tori Perotti was overwhelmed with support from social media users after a customer took to Twitter to call her out for the price of an electric toothbrush last week, news outlets report. The manager at the Swansea Target was approached by David Leavitt when he tried to purchase an electric toothbrush that he said was marked on sale for $0.01 but was actually $89.99. When Perotti refused to sell the toothbrush to Leavitt for a cent, he turned to his more than 200,000 Twitter followers to write that Perotti “is not honoring the price of their items,” in accordance to state law. He added in another tweet that he was going to call 911 over the incident. Social media users came to Perrotti’s defense shortly after, with one person going as far as starting a GoFundMe page.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Haven: Record-high water levels on the Great Lakes are wreaking havoc along the state’s coastlines, swallowing beaches and houses, swamping sewer systems, flooding roads and public buildings, and turning farm fields into lakes. And it’s only expected to get worse this year, state lawmakers were told Thursday. “We won’t have much of a beach this summer. We’re telling people to plan on getting your feet wet if you come here,” said Pat McGinnis, city manager of Grand Haven, which sits on the shores of Lake Michigan. “We had to close a public building because of mold issues from the higher water. We’re shutting them down and tearing them down, and there is no insurance coverage.” In Saginaw County, where the Saginaw River leads into Lake Huron, Public Works Commissioner Brian Wendling said there’s no place for the water to go anymore.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Supreme Court has upheld the city’s authority to impose a minimum wage that’s higher than the state’s. The ruling follows three years of legal fighting over the $15 minimum wage as is seen as a victory for laborers and the city. The manufacturing and supplies company Graco Inc. sued in 2017 to try to block the $15 wage from taking effect, according to the Star Tribune. Graco argued it would create a patchwork of compensation standards because of the state’s $10 minimum wage for large businesses. The Supreme Court said in its ruling that the “Legislature did not intend to occupy the field of minimum-wage rates,” and because the city’s rate would not prevent employers from complying with the lower state rate, Minneapolis’ ordinance could stand. Minneapolis was the first Midwestern city to adopt a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which will be phased in gradually until it peaks in 2024.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Belhaven University is creating scholarships to honor one of its graduates who is the author of bestselling young adult novels. The Angie Thomas Writers Scholarship program will be based at the Jackson school. Thomas wrote “The Hate U Give,” about an African American teenager who sees a police officer shoot and kill her best friend, and “On the Come Up,” about a young rapper who finds her identity and confronts stereotypes through music. One creative writing major at Belhaven will receive a scholarship to cover all expenses for tuition, room and board for four years, the university said in a news release Thursday. Other top applicants may receive smaller awards. Thomas graduated from Belhaven with a bachelor of fine arts degree in 2011. “The Hate U Give” was published in 2017 and was released as a movie in 2018. “On the Come Up” was published in 2019, and Thomas is working as a producer of the movie that is in development. The deadline to apply for the scholarship is March 1.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers are considering whether to allow police in all of the state’s municipalities to reside outside the cities where they work. A House bill initially introduced to lift the residency requirements for officers in St. Louis was expanded Tuesday to include all Missouri cities, despite opposition from Kansas City leaders, The Kansas City Star reports. Many cities currently require all law enforcement officers to live within city limits. St. Louis supports lifting the residency requirements, in part because the police department is 100 officers short. In Kansas City, officers must live in the city one year before beginning employment, and civilian workers have nine months to move into the city. Attorney General Eric Schmitt supports lifting residency requirements, contending it would help recruit and retain officers and help fight violent crime. The mayor and police chief of St. Louis also support the bill.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: An oil-drilling lease dispute has continued in federal court over whether to cancel the lease near Glacier National Park on land considered sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals heard arguments Monday from lawyers for leaseholder Solenex LLC and EarthJustice, which is representing the Blackfeet Nation and some environmental groups, the Missoulian reported Tuesday. Drilling leases in Badger-Two Medicine have been a point of contention for years, court officials said. The Bureau of Land Management in 2016 canceled the oil and gas leases held by Moncrief Oil and Solenex LLC, drawing a lawsuit from the two firms. A U.S. district court later reinstated the leases. Moncrief reached a settlement with environmental groups, but Solenex is still defending its lease, company officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s attorney general filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a commission that voted to allow machine bets on previously run horse races despite the attorney general’s warnings that the machines are illegal. The lawsuit alleges that the Nebraska State Racing Commission approved so-called historical horse racing even after state lawyers advised the commission that the machines violate state law and the Nebraska Constitution’s prohibition of casino gambling. The attorney general’s office said the commission’s vote amounted to a “unilateral decision to expand gambling without action by the Legislature or the citizens of Nebraska.” The commission voted 3-2 in July to allow the terminals at Fonner Park in Grand Island. Lawmakers have considered measures to legalize the machines in the past but rejected them amid arguments that they’re too similar to casino slots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Silver State will be joining Iowa in using mobile apps to gather results from thousands of caucus sites, amid heightened worries about election hacking. The decision to use the apps was made to increase transparency and help run the caucuses more smoothly, says Shelby Wiltz, director of the Nevada State Democratic Party Caucus. Although the technology is intended to make counting easier, it also raises concerns about the potential for hacking or glitches. Party officials say they worked closely with the Democratic National Committee and security experts while picking and vetting the app vendor that was chosen. They declined to name the vendor, citing security reasons. Wiltz says the app has been thoroughly tested. Democratic Party activists in the two states will use programs downloaded to their personal phones to report the results of caucus gatherings to the state headquarters. That data will then be used to announce the unofficial winners.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Sexual assault survivors, parents and other advocates urged lawmakers Thursday to close a loophole in state law they argue enabled a Concord High School teacher accused of abuse. Primo “Howie” Leung was charged in April with sexually assaulting a student off school property in Massachusetts in 2015 and 2016. But school officials did not report him to police after he was seen kissing a different student in 2018 because state law allows teenagers 16 and older to consent to such contact if they are not being coerced. The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on a pair of bills filed in response to the school district’s handling of Leung, who has pleaded not guilty. But both sponsors, Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover, and Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said they back an amendment offered by the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence combining elements of their proposed legislation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: A ham-handed attempt to steal organ pipes has left a township church facing extensive damage. The burglary occurred overnight Tuesday at First United Methodist Church of Freehold, according to a post on the church’s Facebook page. A bid to steal the large decorative pipes caused a collapse that damaged the organ, according to the post. A picture showed the pipes arrayed like pick-up sticks. “At this time, we do not know,” the church’s pastor, the Rev. Wil Wilson, said of the cost of the damage. “Just taking it a day at a time, but costs will be assessed soon.” The post said: “While the damage is shocking and disturbing, we thank God that no one was injured and nothing was stolen. ... We will not let this crush our spirits.” Business will go on as usual. The pastor wrote that Sunday services will be held at 10 a.m.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest university is asking students to help with picking a new school seal to replace one that had sparked protests. The University of New Mexico is allowing students to vote on five options. One has a howling Lobo and the Sandia Mountains in the background. Others have the names of the school around various designs. The move comes after the University of New Mexico began looking for a new design for its official seal following protests from Native Americans over concerns about the seal that featured a sword-carrying Spanish conquistador and a rifle-toting frontiersman. The Native American student groups Kiva Club and The Red Nation had been pressuring the university to drop the seal. “If you want to go to a school, and there is an image of a group of people who killed your ancestors on the logo, then it might deter you from going there,” student Cara Greene told TV station KRQE.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The president of the city’s subways announced his resignation Thursday, two years after being brought in to help turn around the beleaguered system. No reason was given for the unexpected departure of Andy Byford, a British executive with experience in transit systems all over the world. But there had also been tensions, notably with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who largely controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that includes the subways that Byford oversaw. In a statement on his resignation, Byford said he was “very proud” of what had been accomplished during his tenure. Speaking briefly at a board meeting Thursday after his resignation became public, Byford thanked Cuomo for giving him the opportunity and gave him credit for the efforts he and the Legislature made in securing capital funds for system improvements.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: More than 100 sea turtles stunned by recent cold temperatures have washed up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Park Service said. The agency wrote on its Facebook page Wednesday that approximately 95 green and Kemp’s ridley turtles washed ashore Tuesday on the south side of Hatteras Island. Of that total, 35 washed up onto the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the agency said. In addition, the park service says another 10 turtles were found Wednesday morning on the seashore. The turtles were taken to the N.C. Aquarium on Roanoke Island for rehabilitation. Many are expected to be released by the end of the week. The majority of the cold-stunned turtles have been found from Buxton to Hatteras, and seashore biotechs and multiple volunteer organizations continued searching for cold-stunned turtles Wednesday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hundreds of electronic devices aimed at adding speed and security at the voting polls will be distributed to the state’s 53 counties in the coming weeks. The 990 poll books replace the paper process to check in voters that are used in most counties. North Dakota has no voter registration but maintains a central voter file, which is a database of who has voted. “One of the things when it comes to election integrity is that once you come in and show your ID, that automatically goes back into our central voter file, and so if you attempted to vote, let’s say, in Minot or drive up to Killdeer or some other place, they would know that you voted already,” Secretary of State Al Jaeger said Monday. The state’s six or seven larger counties have been using the poll books already, and by February every county will have them, the Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo is using the third birthday of its beloved premature hippo as a way to raise money for Australian wildlife affected by the recent bushfires. Instead of sending birthday gifts, the zoo is asking people to buy T-shirts that will directly benefit the Bushfire Emergency Wildlife Fund. The shirt features a koala and kangaroo giving Fiona a hug and says “Supporting Our Friends Down Under.” All proceeds from sales will be sent to Zoos Victoria to help them care for the animals that are suffering. The zoo will add $5,000 to the total amount raised. Fiona became a global celebrity after she was born Jan. 24, 2017, weighing in at just 29 pounds. The normal range for a hippo’s birth weight is 55 to 120 pounds. Fiona now weighs a healthy 1,300 pounds, according to the zoo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former zookeeper and one-time candidate for governor was sentenced Wednesday to 22 years in prison for his role in a murder-for-hire plot and violating federal wildlife laws. A federal judge in Oklahoma City sentenced 56-year-old Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage – also known as “Joe Exotic” – for trying to arrange the killing of a Florida animal sanctuary founder who criticized his treatment of animals. The woman, Carole Baskin, wasn’t harmed. Maldonado, who maintained his innocence, also was sentenced for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs and falsifying wildlife records. A jury convicted him last April. “I still maintain my innocence and looking forward in the upcoming days to my attorneys filing my appeal and moving onto the next step in this nightmare,” he said in a statement posted to his Facebook page.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Schools raised the statewide high school graduation rate for the class of 2019 to 80% and slightly narrowed racial and economic inequities, according to figures made public early Thursday. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the biggest gains were among low-income students, whose on-time graduation rate rose 2 percentage points; students with disabilities, whose rate rose 3 percentage points; and students who were still learning English as their second language while in high school. The on-time graduation rate for that third group surged more than 4 percentage points to 60%. In 2018, the overall graduation rate was 78.7%. State schools chief Colt Gill hailed what he called an “historic” achievement. He credited hard work in local school districts as well as a half-dozen statewide initiatives for the widespread improvement and the narrowing of racial and other gaps. Oregon’s graduation rate has been considered an embarrassment for many years, with it typically ranking in the very bottom tier of states.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty is under investigation for allegedly assaulting a 13-year-old boy during a photo shoot, police said. Chris Greenwell and his son Brandon met the hairy, googly-eyed mascot at a November event for season ticket holders. Brandon patted Gritty on the head after he and his father posed for a photo with him at the Wells Fargo Center, Greenwell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Greenwell said that as Brandon walked away, Gritty ran out of his chair and “punched my son as hard as he could.” Greenwell, who told the newspaper he only wanted an apology and something special for his son, filed a complaint with police Dec. 21. A police spokesperson said Tuesday that the investigation is “active and ongoing.” Officials at Comcast Spectacor, the company that owns the Flyers, said it conducted an investigation but couldn’t verify whether the alleged assault happened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban 3D guns. The measure would make it illegal for anyone in Rhode Island to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive any firearm that is made from plastic, fiberglass or through a 3D-printing process. The proposal received unanimous approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday night. The guns, also referred to as “ghost guns,” are especially dangerous because they can pass through metal detectors and be obtained by people who wouldn’t otherwise pass background checks, supporters have argued. Critics of the bill contend that the ban is unnecessary and that existing laws tackle undetectable firearms.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgetown: A sheriff’s deputy responding to a burglary call was forced to settle a beef between his K9 and a spooked cow by using a stun gun. Georgetown County sheriff’s deputies were dispatched to the Pleasant Hill community Wednesday when a K9 that was brought to the scene reportedly became “distracted” and bit a cow belonging to the property owners, a statement from the agency said. The officer was forced to stun the dog to prevent the cow from being seriously injured, the office said. Reacting to the bite, the cow charged at the deputy and property owner, hitting them and causing minor injuries. After taking stock of the situation, the deputy placed the dog in his cruiser. None of the people or animals involved appeared to be seriously hurt. At the end of it all, the sheriff’s office determined the original burglary call was unfounded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Twenty-one state legislators have signed on in support of a bill that would prohibit local governments from banning plastic bags, straws and other products. Eight states have banned single-use plastic bags, and 15 states, including Minnesota and North Dakota, have adopted laws prohibiting government entities from banning plastic bags, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republican Sen. John Wiik says he decided to introduce the legislation after working with retailers on the issue and seeing neighboring states attempt similar legislation. “I just thought it was time to move ahead and give the small businesses, your mom-and-pop convenience stores and small town businesses, a little more solid footing going into the future,” Wiik says. The question of a ban rose to the surface in Sioux Falls last year after the flooded Big Sioux River left thousands of plastic bags stuck in the trees along the river banks as the water receded.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city says it has emergency, private garbage crews on standby in case of a “wildcat” work stoppage this weekend. “They are operating outside of their leadership. Should this stoppage occur, it’s in breach of the memorandum of understanding with the city and also the ordinance,” city spokesman Dan Springer said. he said any worker who participates in an unauthorized work stoppage technically resigns their position under the city charter. How large of a work stoppage is planned for Saturday or if it will happen at all is unclear. Any potential stoppage could delay trash pickup scheduled for this weekend after being pushed back for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The head of AFSCME Local 1733, the Memphis sanitation workers union, wrote a letter to Mayor Jim Strickland last week disavowing a planned, “unsanctioned” strike.\n\nTexas\n\nTomball: A teacher who authorities say brought a handgun to school and made threatening comments about colleagues has been arrested. Mark Davis, a history and geography teacher at Concordia Lutheran High School, was arrested Wednesday. Tomball police say he’s charged with possessing a weapon in a prohibited place and threatening to exhibit or use a firearm at a school. According to a criminal complaint, a teacher who encountered Davis, 62, on Tuesday in a first-floor common area at the private school said he “appeared to be more angry than usual.” Davis told the teacher he felt the principal gave another school a bad reference regarding his time at Concordia, and he complained the school’s baseball coach hadn’t picked him for an assistant coaching position. The teacher told police Davis said he would buy an automatic rifle and had a handgun upstairs, according to the complaint, and he told school officials he brought it to campus to “protect the kids.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A contentious state tax overhaul will be repealed amid growing voter backlash to the plan that would raise taxes on food and groceries while cutting income tax, Republican legislative leaders said Thursday. The repeal was announced after an effort to challenge it through a citizen referendum appeared to have succeeded in getting a spot on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. Gov. Gary Herbert told reporters during his regular monthly news conference on PBS Utah that an overhaul is still needed, but lawmakers will likely wait to take up the issue until next year. The legislative session begins Monday. “I think we’re accommodating the will of the people,” Herbert said about the repeal. “The fact that we have pushback means we have not done our job as far as convincing the people this is the right thing to do or the right way to do it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is looking to award $2 million to help construct fast vehicle charging stations along highway corridors. The state is requesting proposals for a third round of grant funding to build Direct Current Fast Charging stations at eleven priority locations along Vermont’s major arteries. As of last October, there were more than 3,500 electric vehicles registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles, up 154% since 2016. The third round of funding will ensure charging stations are available along interstate and other priority highway corridors such as interstates 89 and 91, U.S. Route 4 and Vermont Route 100. “Electric car owners often charge at home, but increased availability and speed of public charging are critical to advancing transportation electrification in Vermont,” said David Roberts, the Drive Electric Vermont coordinator.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An event considered the world’s leading international competition for young violinists will feature a Virginia competitor when it comes to the city this spring. The Menuhin Competition Richmond 2020 on Wednesday announced the 44 competitors who had been selected from a pool of 321 applicants for the May event. The Menuhin Competition, which is held every two years in a different location, is known as “Olympics of the Violin.” The competitors represent 16 countries of residence across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and 13 U.S. states, according to a press release from event organizers. Kayleigh Kim, a 15-year-old from northern Virginia, will compete in the junior level of the competition, for ages 15 and under. The senior level features musicians 21 and under. The event was founded in 1983 by violinist Yehudi Menuhin, one of the great musical talents of the 20th century.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Middle and high school students joined administrators, parents and doctors Wednesday in urging a state Senate committee to pass severe restrictions on nicotine vaping products, decrying how some of their peers leave class to vape in the bathroom or even use the products during class by exhaling into their sleeve. Washington adopted a temporary ban on flavored e-cigarette juice in October as the nation grappled with a mysterious, sometimes fatal lung illness that appeared linked to vaping. Since then, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has said the outbreak appears to have been linked mostly to vitamin E acetate in vaping products containing THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis. The bill considered by the Senate Health and Long Term Care Committee on Wednesday would make the flavor ban permanent, while also limiting the nicotine content and size of each vaping juice cartridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s public schools superintendent wants the state Board of Education not to reduce the number of social studies courses required for high school graduation. Superintendent Steve Paine said in a statement that he will make the recommendation based on an overwhelming response to the proposal. Last month the Board of Education placed the overall high school credits proposal up for public comment through Jan. 24. It would reduce the number of required social studies courses in favor of other courses such as career technical education and computer science. Meanwhile, a new class on cooking, cleaning and budgeting could be coming to schools under a bill passed Thursday by the Senate. Lawmakers voted 33-0 to approve the proposal to have the state education board come up with a home economics course that would also include training on sewing, minor home repair and time management.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Brewers home ballpark will have a new name next year after a 20-year deal with Miller comes to an end. American Family Insurance announced this week that Miller Park will become American Family Field next Jan. 1. A new logo and other branding elements will be revealed later this year. The Brewers a year ago announced the 15-year naming rights deal with American Family, but the name of the ballpark was not known until now. No terms of the agreement were announced. The deal with Miller was worth $40 million. The brewing company, now MillerCoors, showed little or no interest in extending the naming rights. The insurance company also has the naming rights to the main amphitheater at Summerfest, the music festival along Milwaukee’s lakefront.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Sleeping Giant Ski Area in northwest Wyoming is suspending winter operations after this season because of financial problems. Amy Woods, manager of the Yellowstone Recreations Foundation, announced the board of directors’ decision this week, saying that “the number of skiers and snowboarders we currently attract does not make winter operations financially feasible as we run a deficit of over $200,000 per year.” She said the decision is “agonizing but necessary.” The Cody Enterprise reports the zipline will not be affected and will start running again in the summer. In 2007, a local group launched a plan to acquire Sleeping Giant, which had shuttered three years earlier. The Yellowstone Recreations Foundation was established to reopen the ski area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/12/virus-rains-parades-utah-women-walk-teachers-strike-news-around-states/111417390/", "title": "Virus rains on parades, Utah women walk out: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will provide artifacts from the last slave ship to dock in the United States for a special public exhibition later this year, officials said Tuesday. The Alabama Historical Commission, in a statement, said an exhibit named for the slave ship Clotilda is set to open this fall in Mobile, where the schooner arrived with African captives in 1860. The artifacts include pieces of wood and metal taken from a muddy river bottom where the ship was discovered, said Jim Delgado, a maritime archaeologist who helped identify the wreck. The History Museum of Mobile will add pieces from its own collection to help tell the story of the port’s maritime history, the commission said. The city is working on plans for a new facility to house the exhibition. To settle a bet between wealthy white men on whether slaves could be imported into the South in defiance of a federal ban, the wooden ship illegally transported 110 people from west Africa to Alabama, where they became slaves. The freed people later settled in a community called Africatown, which still exists and will be the site of the exhibition.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The city’s tourism task force is not expected to recommend placing a cap on the number of visitors during the upcoming tourist season. The City and Borough of Juneau Visitor Industry Task Force is more likely to recommend the city use infrastructure to limit the number of visitors, The Juneau Empire reports. The 10-member task force met Sunday to develop recommendations it hopes to present to a March 23 meeting of the Committee of the Whole, a work session of the city assembly. The infrastructure changes could include berthing larger cruise ships filled with passengers closer to the city to reduce congestion, as well as requiring longer separations between ship arrivals. Mayor Beth Weldon created the task force in 2019 to answer questions about the management of Juneau’s growing tourist industry. There are expected to be 1.44 million visitors to Southeast Alaska communities this season.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Rough roads are costing the state’s drivers about $2,000 each year in car repairs and time lost to traffic, according to a report officials released Tuesday amid a renewed push at the Capitol to raise gas taxes. The report from TRIP, a Washington, D.C., transportation nonprofit, concludes that the total cost to Arizona drivers from added vehicle repairs, crashes where the roadway was a contributing factor, and added time and fuel expenses is worth $9.6 billion. The report says 44% of major roads and highways in Arizona are in poor or mediocre condition, based on data from the Federal Highway Administration. Officials from the League of Arizona Cities and Towns along with the County Supervisors Association of Arizona, representing all 91 incorporated municipalities and supervisors from all 15 counties, said the report shows the need for more tax revenue for road repairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Department of Human Services is requesting double-digit pay increases for direct care workers at state institutions for the developmentally disabled in hopes of retaining the employees. The department’s proposal includes five human development centers where pay would increase about 18%, from $22,000 to $26,034, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Pay for supervisors would also increase almost 12%. Currently direct care and support staff members all make the same starting pay. Part of the proposal would also offer free training for all employees to become certified nursing assistants and require the direct care staff members from all five centers to achieve the certification by the end of the year. The proposed changes in salary increase are in hopes of reducing annual turnover that currently averages more than 100% across the five centers, said Melissa Stone, director of the department’s Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state may have to end most restrictions on personalized license plate language that some might find offensive, if a lawsuit filed Tuesday prevails. The libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation lawsuit challenges the state Department of Motor Vehicles’ current policy on free speech grounds. The department denied more than 30,000 of the nearly 250,000 applications submitted in 2018, the last year for which statistics are available, after deciding that the proposed language “may carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency,” says the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco. Department officials declined comment on the pending litigation, which challenges a program that brought the state nearly $60 million last year. The environmental plates challenged in the lawsuit cost $53 initially and $43 annually to renew and are among 14 special interest license plates that help pay for environmental and special programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A bill allowing electric vehicle manufacturers to sell directly to consumers passed a key state legislative committee, clearing the way for a compromise with auto dealerships. The House Energy and Environment Committee approved an amended version of the bill Monday, The Colorado Sun reports. The original measure would have allowed Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and other automakers with dealer franchises to jump into the direct-sales market to sell their electric vehicles. The compromise was an amendment that will allow only automakers that have no existing dealer franchise to sell electric vehicles direct to consumers. Democratic House Speaker KC Becker, a primary sponsor of the measure, said the bill’s intention is to close a loophole allowing only Tesla Inc. to sell its electric cars directly to Colorado residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haven: A lawsuit brought by a retired police department employee was reinstated Tuesday by an appeals court. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Dyanna Green can try to prove that her punishment for taking a container of biscuits from the department’s communal refrigerator was part of age discrimination. Green was 58 and working in the records division in 2012 when she says the department’s bosses created a hostile work environment to force retirement after hiring someone else half her age to replace a recently retired worker in the division. Facing a disciplinary hearing, she quit. In December 2014, Green maintained she took one of two canisters of buttermilk biscuits dough to her desk, planning to bake them at home and bring them back for officers and staff, the appeals court said. But before Green went home, a lieutenant sent an email to employees demanding the missing canister be returned. When Green tried to return it, she encountered the police chief standing by the refrigerator, which had yellow “crime scene” tape sealing it, the appeals court said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some state lawmakers say that if you do business in Delaware, you need to accept cash. A bill introduced Tuesday prohibits any business selling goods or services from refusing to accept cash from a consumer making an in-person purchase. Senate President David McBride says not everyone has a bank account, and many people cannot obtain credit or debit cards. Lawmakers also note that there is currently no federal law mandating that businesses or individuals accept paper currency. Officials in other states and localities, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City, also have taken action to ban cashless stores. Massachusetts passed its law almost 40 years ago. Under the proposed legislation in Delaware, a person who violated the law could be fined up to $10,000 per violation.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The annual St. Patrick’s Parade in the district has been postponed as what officials say is a precaution to growing coronavirus concerns, WUSA-TV reports. The parade was originally scheduled for this Sunday. Organizers with the parade committee announced the postponement in an email Wednesday, citing concerns about the health and safety of attendants. The parade is one of many events and conferences to get postponed or canceled in the DMV, with organizers and attendants taking preventative measures to help reduce the impact of the virus. On Wednesday, D.C. Public Schools announced it will be closing schools next week to prepare for potential impact on students and faculty. Colleges have begun to prepare for the virus impact as well, with Georgetown University announcing Wednesday that it will move to virtual learning until after spring break Monday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state would create a task force to identify unmarked and abandoned African American cemeteries and make recommendations on how to preserve them under a bill unanimously passed by the Senate on Monday. Several such cemeteries have been found around the state, including one in Tampa where the local housing authority built apartments above the graves of about 800 African Americans buried in the early 1900s, as well as a slave burying ground that’s now under a Tallahassee golf course. “Across the state of Florida, such cemeteries called lost are being found,” Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson said. “We cannot continue to run away from our collective history, and we can no longer allow others to rewrite that history or, at its worst, force the history off the pages of time.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Legislation advancing at the state Capitol aims to raise the age at which teens can be charged as adults from 17 to 18. The House Juvenile Justice Committee approved the bill unanimously Monday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Georgia, Wisconsin and Texas are the only states that charge people over the age of 16 as adults, according to the newspaper. The bill moving forward in Georgia would allow the juvenile justice system to handle cases involving 17-year-olds accused of committing crimes. Those cases are currently heard in superior court. “This is really about making sure 17-year-olds aren’t burdened with criminal records that are going to hurt them in the long run,” said Josh Rovner with Washington, D.C.-based criminal justice nonprofit The Sentencing Project. Supporters say it would also give the teens greater access to services that try to prevent them from committing another crime.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials have confirmed another discovery of a fungal disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of native ohia trees in the state. An ohia tree with the infection was found on Oahu near the popular Poamoho trail above Wahiawa, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources confirmed the tree was infected with Ceratocystis huliohia, the less aggressive of the two fungal species responsible for the blight. The fungal disease infected four other trees on Oahu and has been found on each of the four main islands. An aerial survey in November found Oahu’s fourth case of the fungal disease at the Honolulu Watershed Forest Reserve above Tripler Army Medical Center. The state will be cautious in removing the latest infected tree because Poamoho is a critical watershed that is home to numerous endangered plants and animals, officials say.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration decision to reopen a long-closed road built through grizzly bear habitat in northern Idaho. The Center for Biological Diversity and four other groups contend the road will harm grizzly bears, mountain caribou and other wildlife in the Selkirk Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security last month announced plans to reopen more than 5 miles of Bog Creek Road because of threats to border security. The agencies didn’t specify the types of threats. The road was closed in the late 1980s to protect endangered grizzly bears roaming the area between Upper Priest Lake and the Canadian border. “Not only is this proposed road bad for bears, it’s also totally unnecessary for border security,” said Andrea Santarsiere, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man’s decades­long stay in isolation in a prison in the state has prompted proposed legislation that would limit how long a prisoner can stay in solitary confinement. Called the Anthony Gay Isolated Confinement Restriction Act, the legislation would bar the Illinois Department of Corrections from placing an inmate in isolation for more than 10 days in a six-month period. IDOC would also be required to give isolated inmates access to therapy, medical appointments, job assignments and exercise outside their cells. Anthony Gay went to prison in 1994 for stealing a dollar bill and a hat. Behavior problems, including self-mutilation, added to his sentence, and by the time he was released in August 2018, he had served 24 years in prison, 22 in solitary confinement. Later that year, the Corrections Department determined nearly 1 in 3 prisoners in segregation had serious mental illness issues.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In an effort to combat distracted driving, state legislators on Tuesday gave their final approval to a proposal banning motorists from using handheld cellphones on Indiana roads. The state House voted 81-11 and the Senate 49-1 in favor of the bill allowing cellphone use by drivers only with hands-free or voice-operated technology, except in emergencies. The measure would broaden the state’s current ban on texting while driving that officials point out is unenforceable and doesn’t ban actions such as emailing or using Snapchat, Twitter and other apps. The new law would take effect in July, but any tickets issued to violators won’t result in state Bureau of Motor Vehicles points toward a driver’s license suspension until July 2021. Distracted driving was to blame in at least 860 injury crashes and 48 fatalities in Indiana last year, according to state police.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state House has passed a bill that would change how much THC patients can receive through the medical marijuana program, add more qualifying conditions and allow more health care practitioners to recommend Iowans be added to the program. The bill, which passed on a vote of 52-46, follows the recommendation of a state advisory board and is in line with what Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said she is comfortable with signing, but Democrats called it a step backward for the program. The bill would replace Iowa’s current percentage-based limit, which allows medical marijuana products to contain up to 3% THC, with a per-patient limit of 4.5 grams of THC in a 90-day period. There are two exceptions to the THC limit: if a doctor determines that amount is insufficient to treat a patient’s condition, or if the patient is terminally ill.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are taking steps to allow college athletes to hire agents and sign endorsement deals because they fear that if they don’t, out-of-state rivals will attract the best recruits and leave Kansas’ athletic programs in the dust. A bill that would bar state universities from preventing their athletes from earning outside compensation easily cleared the state Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday. It also would allow private, nonprofit colleges to permit their athletes to hire agents and do endorsements. It goes next to the full Senate for debate. Athletics officials at the University of Kansas and Kansas State University back the measure, and it appears to have bipartisan support, as Kansas’ top-ranked men’s basketball team looks ahead to March Madness. “We need to make sure that we are, as a state giving, a signal to the NCAA, ‘You need to be addressing this, or you’re going to have a quilt of legislation in all the different states,’ ” said state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear urged churches on Wednesday to cancel worship services this week as part of his recommendation that people avoid large gatherings to help prevent spread of the new coronavirus. “I don’t believe that whether you go to church during this period of time is a test of faith,” he said. “I believe God gives us wisdom to protect each other, and we should do that.” Beshear also said that state prisons are being temporarily closed to visitors and that nonessential out-of-state travel has been suspended for state employees. He recommended that private businesses do the same. The governor acknowledged that recommending the cancellation of worship services statewide was a “big step” and one that’s likely to draw some pushback. But he said he sees it as necessary to protect public health.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is restarting its stalled effort to replace its voting machines, with the solicitation for bidders expected to go out shortly, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said Tuesday. New machines, however, won’t be in place quickly. Louisiana will continue casting ballots this fall on the same types of voting system that it has used for 15 years, without the paper backup advocated by many elections security experts. “It’ll be after the election. It won’t be for the presidential election because we don’t have the time to get through the (bid) process completely,” Ardoin, the state’s chief elections official, told lawmakers during a House Appropriations Committee budget hearing. Allegations of improper bid handling derailed a previous effort to replace Louisiana’s voting machines, so the secretary of state’s office has had to redo its vendor search process.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature is revisiting the state’s stricter vaccine law to make some tweaks before it goes into effect next year. The new law eliminates religious and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccines starting in September 2021. But the education committee on Monday took up a proposal to exempt students enrolled in online charter schools from the new requirements. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Ryan Tipping, said Monday that it made little sense for the stricter rules to apply to kids who don’t sit in a classroom. Reject Big Pharma, a group that unsuccessfully fought the elimination of most vaccine opt-outs, was represented at the hearing. Mainers voted overwhelmingly last week to keep the new law that ends nonmedical vaccine opt-outs by September 2021 at public and private schools and universities, including nursery schools.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Electric bills may be going up if the state’s Public Service Commission approves a request from Delmarva Power to raise rates to its Eastern Shore customers. The electric provider is asking the commission to approve a rate increase that could cost the “average electric residential customer” $5.10 more a month, according to a press release from the PSC. Delmarva Power currently serves 206,000 customers on the Eastern Shore, according to the PSC press release. The utility estimated the rate increase could result in an additional $18.5 million for the company, according to a filing with the PSC. Delmarva Power has been replacing parts of its infrastructure as well as installing new technology to “provide reliable service in a cost-effective manner,” according to the company’s request.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A police patrol plan on the area’s public transit system that took effect in 2016 continues to keep violent crime consistently lower than it was just five years ago, Transit Police Superintendent Richard Sullivan said. Sullivan on Tuesday released figures showing there were 779 homicides, rapes, aggravated assaults, larcenies and other so-called part one violent crimes on the MBTA last year, compared to 770 in 2018, he said Tuesday. The four-year average for 2016 through 2019, however, stands at 782, compared to 998 for the previous five years, he told The Boston Globe. Sullivan said the numbers show that since he and Chief Kenneth Green instituted a new patrol plan in 2016, “part-one crimes had a precipitous drop, and we’ve maintained that for the last four years.” Riders take more than 1.1 million trips on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority every weekday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Water and sewer system projects are getting started in two neighborhoods as part of a $500 million program to upgrade the city’s aging water infrastructure. Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department is investing more than $44 million into Cornerstone Village and North Rosedale Park, according to the city. The work includes replacing water mains, fire hydrants and city sewer pipes. Lead service lines will be replaced with copper pipes on blocks where water mains are being replaced. The Water and Sewerage Department is replacing some service lines on private property at the department’s cost. Cornerstone Village is on Detroit’s east side. North Rosedale Park is in northwest Detroit. Most Detroit water and sewer pipes are more than 80 years old, the city said, adding that the last massive infrastructure upgrade was in 1930.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Some 36,000 public school students had another day off Wednesday while their teachers walked the picket line in the second day of a labor strike. Teachers and support staff picketed again outside the city’s schools, as parents scrambled to make alternative plans for their children. St. Paul Federation of Educators spokeswoman Megan Boldt said Wednesday that no new contract talks have been scheduled with the school district. “We are ready to come back to the table when the district is ready to make some movement,” said union president Nick Faber. The two sides broke off talks about 3 a.m. Tuesday after six days of mediation. The union wants mental health teams in every school building, but district officials say that would be cost-prohibitive. The union also wants more multilingual staff and additional educators working with students with special needs.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state House voted Tuesday to put a second medical marijuana proposal on the statewide ballot this year. But people who petitioned to get the first one there say the second is designed to split the vote and kill both proposals. More than 200,000 people signed petitions to put Initiative 65 on the November ballot. It would amend the Mississippi Constitution to allow the prescription of up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for a person with a debilitating medical condition. On Tuesday, the Mississippi House voted to put an alternative medical marijuana proposal on the same ballot. Republican Rep. Trey Lamar of Senatobia said the alternative would allow local zoning regulations that would prevent pot shops from springing up on main streets. The alternative would restrict the smoking of prescribed marijuana to people with terminal illnesses, although people who are ill but not dying could use oils or other forms of the drug.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new four-year medical school will focus on training doctors who will work in poor urban and rural areas. Puerto Rico-based Ponce Health Sciences University is making an $80 million commitment to develop the new campus in north St. Louis, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Construction will begin later this year with a freshman class of 150 in the fall of 2022. Ponce President David Lenihan told the newspaper the goal is to provide opportunities for minority and low-income students who fail to get a spot in a traditional medical school but show promise to succeed. He said those students tend to work in communities where they grew up and have a strong understanding of their patients. Herb Kuhn, Missouri Hospital Association president, said several counties have no primary care physicians, and eight acute hospitals in rural Missouri have closed in the past five years. All told, 44 Missouri counties lack a hospital.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The U.S. Department of the Interior is providing money for two specialists to help it manage grizzly bears in the state following conflicts with landowners and livestock that often end in bears being killed by wildlife workers. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in letter to members of Montana’s congressional delegation that the agency would play a “more conclusive role” in dealing with problem bears. Grizzlies are protected as a threatened species, and hunting of them is not allowed. However, bears that prey on livestock or pose a threat to public safety are routinely killed. Interior is entering a $250,000 contract with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services to hire the two bear management specialists. The state is home to the largest grizzly populations in the U.S. outside Alaska, with more than 1,000 bears in northwestern Montana, and hundreds more live in the Yellowstone region.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State lawmakers will debate a new bill to lower property taxes as early as next week after a legislative committee endorsed it in a Tuesday vote. Members of the Revenue Committee voted 6-1 in favor of the bill, which would provide roughly the same $520 million boost to Nebraska’s K-12 public schools as an earlier proposal that stalled last month. Schools are the biggest consumers of local property tax revenue in Nebraska, and the bill would offer them the additional money along with tighter controls on their ability to tax and spend. Schools fought an earlier version of the bill, saying they don’t trust the state to maintain its commitment and arguing that the controls would hinder their flexibility. The new version relaxes some of the proposed controls, although schools may still question it.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state judge has again rejected a decades­long bid to tap groundwater beneath vast rangelands in northeast Nevada and pipe it to fast-growing suburbs and glittering gambling resorts in and around Las Vegas. In a strongly worded statement, Judge Robert Estes said he saw no reason to undo findings he made in December 2013 that block a Southern Nevada Water Authority plan to spend billions of dollars to pump groundwater from four rural valleys in White Pine and Lincoln counties near the Utah border. Simeon Herskovits, an attorney representing the Great Basin Water Network and most opponents of the project, called the ruling “the end of the road for the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the state engineer, unless they appeal again to the (state) Supreme Court.” The order followed two days of hearings last November.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As spring approaches, the state’s Department of Environmental Services wants to hear from residents when lakes and ponds become ice-free. The “ice-out” conditions mean a water body is thawed and can be navigated by boat. Lake Winnipesaukee has annual “ice-out” observations by aircraft. New Hampshire Public Radio reports there are “ice-out” conditions on some lakes in the southern part of the state. It’s similar to conditions in other mild winter years, such as 2018 and 2016. State officials are looking for more long-term data of “ice-in” dates, as well, to show whether warmer winters are causing shorter ice seasons.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLeonia: A town near the busy George Washington Bridge has won a court reprieve in its effort to close residential streets to reduce gridlock from commuters using navigation apps. Leonia made headlines two years ago when it implemented the closures, after the town passed ordinances limiting traffic on some streets to local residents or nonresidents having business in town. Apps like Waze and Apple Maps typically reroute some of the tens of thousands of vehicles headed to the bridge each morning, particularly when there is an accident or other disruption. Police said in 2018 that studies showed that more than 2,000 vehicles often passed through the town of about 9,000 residents from just one of the three exits off Interstate 95, causing safety concerns and gridlock on side streets.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A woman is facing charges after police say she stole a car and later tried to claim she was pop singer Beyonce Knowles. Surena Henry was arrested Saturday morning in Las Cruces when an officer spotted a vehicle that resembled one that recently had been reported stolen, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports. According to court documents, the 48-year-old Henry ignored the officer’s orders to pull over and later parked in front of her home. Documents say Henry told the officer she was Beyonce. Police also reported Henry told the officer she found the keys in the vehicle and decided to take it for a joy ride. She also allegedly told police that she didn’t stop driving when she saw the emergency lights because she didn’t feel like it. Henry is charged with unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, concealing identity, and resisting or obstructing an arrest.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade has been postponed for the first time in its 258-year history because of coronavirus concerns, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. The postponement of next Tuesday’s parade adds to the roster of events and holidays upended around the world by the spreading infection. Chicago, Boston and even the Irish capital, Dublin, have canceled St. Patrick’s Day parades. The New York parade honoring Irish heritage dates back longer than the United States and draws tens of thousands of marchers and throngs of spectators to Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. Cuomo, a Democrat, said while the risk of transmission might be lower in an outdoor gathering, health experts had urged him to call it off. The governor’s statement did not say when this year’s parade will take place, if at all. But Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted late in the night that he promises the parade will go on, “whether it’s in the heat of summer or on a clear fall day.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A police shooting that wounded a suspect during a foot chase in the city sparked protests early Wednesday from hundreds who demanded answers and burned a flag outside the governor’s mansion. Police Chief Cassandra Deck-Brown said officers responded to a 911 call Tuesday evening reporting a man with a gun near a shopping center in eastern Raleigh. She said arriving officers spotted a person matching the caller’s description, later identified as 26-year-old Javier Torres. Torres ran and was chased by officers who repeatedly ordered him to stop and drop the gun, Deck-Brown said. Torres was shot in the abdomen by an officer who had joined the chase, the chief said, adding that the suspect was running directly toward that officer and would not drop his gun. The extent of Torres’ injuries was not immediately known.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Democrats moved Tuesday to bolster staffing at the largest of the state’s 14 caucus sites after heavy turnout forced some voters in Fargo to wait in line as long as an hour. The party had been expecting a big surge in turnout due to a revamping of the state’s caucus system and high interest in the presidential race. North Dakota shifted this year from traditional caucuses to so-called firehouse caucuses that function largely like a typical election, with voters able to show up, cast a ballot and leave. The process is run by the parties. Democrats set up 14 voting sites around the state, with voting from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The lines were longest in Fargo, the state’s largest city and home to North Dakota State University. The party said wait times in Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, were about 40 minutes. Lines were shorter in Bismarck and Minot. Bernie Sanders ultimately won North Dakota, the smallest prize among states that voted Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: An investigation into hazing allegations against Ohio University’s marching band found several “concerning” unsanctioned band traditions, according to university documents. The Marching 110 is one of several campus groups that was investigated last fall for hazing allegations that led to the suspension of all the university’s fraternities. The investigation, which included interviews with 117 students and seven staff members, could lead to the removal of some students from the band, The Columbus Dispatch reports. Multiple annual band events included the illegal consumption of alcohol, as well as the use of marijuana on a bus during a band trip, according to a summary of the investigation. The summary also detailed other incidents such as band members competing to drink a gallon of milk in an hour and one section watching pornography together for several years. None of the conduct resulted in “grave physical harm,” and students were not forced to consume alcohol or marijuana.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House on Wednesday passed legislation to prohibit minors under 16 years of age from getting married. The House’s vote reversed actions the chamber took earlier in the week to kill a different version of the bill.The latest version of House Bill 3873 by Rep. Jason Dunnington, D-Oklahoma City, prohibits those under age 16 from getting married. Currently, teenagers under age 16 can get married if a court approves. Under the proposal, minors ages 16 and 17 would have to get parental and court approval for a marriage. Additionally, the court would be required to conduct an on-camera interview with the minor or minors to ensure they are entering the marriage willingly. The court also would be required to verify a minor is of age to get married, according to the amendment proposed by Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid. The amendment seemed to appease many legislative Republicans who voted down an earlier version of the bill, saying it cut parents out of the process.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The U.S. Forest Service wants to change the rules for recreation in the hundreds of underground caves that dot the Deschutes National Forest to protect them from vandalism. Rules to shield the caves – and the bats that call them their home – have been in effect since the 1990s, The Bulletin reports. Advances in mobile mapping technology and an increase in central Oregon’s population, however, have put more of a strain on the 700 known caves. Problems include litter, graffiti, loud music that can disturb bats, bolts and anchors that have been illegally installed for climbing, and human feces, the newspaper says. Streamlining the rules will make it easier for the public to understand them and will give the laws more teeth, officials said. Tom Rodhouse, an ecologist with the National Park Service, said the efforts will also help bats, which use some of central Oregon’s caves for protection in both summer and winter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A task force set up three years ago issued recommendations Wednesday about how to improve the process of reentering outside society among prisoners who have finished their sentences. The Pennsylvania Reentry Council’s report addresses housing, work, health, education and other challenges that former inmates face upon release from incarceration. The group says reentry coalitions are currently in 30 of the 67 counties but should be established across the state. It is calling for all prisons and jails to hire reentry counselors, as the Department of Corrections has done. It urges lawmakers to fund a program to provide state-issued identification to all inmates upon release, expanding to counties an effort that’s currently done in state prisons with assistance from the Transportation Department.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees making minimum wage in the state can expect to receive an additional $1 per hour. Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill into law Tuesday that raises the minimum wage from $10.50 to $11.50, effective Oct. 1. The state House of Representatives passed the legislation in February. Some Republicans voted against the bill, saying the steadily rising wage threatens to hurt employers and could lead to job losses. Some Democrats supported the bill, though they had wanted a higher raise. The minimum wage has increased multiple times since 2012, when it was $7.40. It was bumped up from $10.10 to $10.50 at the beginning of 2019. The hourly rate in Massachusetts is $12.75, and Maine’s is $12. Connecticut’s minimum wage is $11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The House passed the state’s $10 billion budget Wednesday, putting additional money into teacher salaries, roads, safety at state prisons, and tax relief and rebates. The House finished work on the spending plan a day earlier than usual, much faster than expected given that lawmakers had $1.8 billion more to spend this year than last. The biggest debate of the week was over raises for state employees. The spending plan offers $42 million for extra pay but sends the pool of money to agency leaders to decide who gets raises and how much. Democrats wanted to offer an across-the-board increase – a 5% or 2.5% raise for all state employees that would be funded by reducing tax cuts – because they said it would take possible favoritism out of the equation. “Not everybody in state government has the luxury of knowing somebody in this chamber,” said Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orangeburg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe passed a referendum to legalize medical and recreational marijuana on the Pine Ridge Reservation, according to preliminary results from the tribe’s election commission. A proposal to allow alcohol in the tribe’s casino failed. In the tally from all precincts announced Wednesday morning, both medical and recreational marijuana passed by wide margins, with 82% of voters approving medical marijuana and 74% approving recreational pot. The alcohol proposal failed by 12 percentage points. The Oglala Sioux will become the only Native American tribe to set up a cannabis market in a state where it’s otherwise illegal. Chase Iron Eyes, a spokesperson for the tribe’s president, Julian Bear Runner, said the vote reflected the difference in how many tribal members perceive alcohol and marijuana. He called alcohol a “poison” that was forced on the tribe but marijuana a “healing plant” that presented a path out of poverty and historical trauma.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is recruiting volunteers to adopt a trail, according to a news release from the park. Trail volunteers are asked to hike at least one designated trail four times each year and submit a report on conditions. With 848 miles of maintained trails, the information volunteers provide is critical to helping trail maintenance staff prioritize work, according to the release. The cooperation helps ensure that trails remain accessible to visitors. Volunteers should be comfortable hiking in the backcountry and enjoy interaction with visitors, according to the release. A 3-hour training session is required. Information on adopting a trail and other volunteer opportunities is available at the Friends of the Smokies website under the “volunteer” tab.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated after his wife called police to their house over an argument, according to court records released Tuesday. The Infowars founder was booked into an Austin jail shortly after midnight and released on bond a few hours later, Travis County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kristen Dark said. Jones, 46, had a “strong odor of alcohol” coming from him, and his blood-alcohol level was recorded at .076 and .079, according to court records. In Texas, the legal blood alcohol limit is .08%. Jones was also allegedly unable to complete sobriety tests, losing his balance and failing to touch heel to toe. An attorney for Jones did not immediately return a message seeking comment Tuesday. An article posted on his Infowars website suggested he was pulled over for going 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. The article mentions Jones having a “small amount of sake” with his wife at dinner but does not mention an argument.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All six women in the state Senate walked out in protest and refused to vote before the chamber passed a bill mandating that a woman be shown an ultrasound before receiving an abortion. Republican Sen. Deidre Henderson said the walkout late Tuesday was a spontaneous decision to underscore concerns about the “invasive nature” of the bill. The six female lawmakers – two Republicans and four Democrats – would not have changed the outcome. Five Republican men voted against the measure that passed 16-7. Henderson said she opposes abortion, but the mandatory ultrasound proposal went too far. It would require showing a pregnant woman images and making the fetal heartbeat audible, if possible. Women now get an ultrasound before abortions, but providers aren’t required to show them the results. Under the bill, doctors could be fined $100,000 or more if they don’t.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The City Council has voted to guarantee local law enforcement cannot report a person’s citizenship status to federal immigration agents. The council voted 11 to 1 Monday night in support of a resolution written by Councilor Perri Freeman, WCAX-TV reports. The resolution amends the Fair and Impartial Policing Policy adopted by the city in 2017. The resolution came in response to concerns about potential loopholes in protections for immigrants in the policy. Activists contended that immigrants living in Burlington should not have to fear that local law enforcement officers are working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Burlington Interim Police Chief Jennifer Morrison said that the council’s decision violates federal law and could put federal funding at risk.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hunters killed a record number of American black bears during the state’s 2019-2020 hunting season, according to data from the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Hunters reported 3,540 kills during the period, the Virginian-Pilot reports, citing data from the department. That’s about 840 more bears than were recorded during the 2018-2019 season, said Stephanie Simek, the department’s bear project leader. American black bears are the only species of bear in the state, and the department said it extended the hunting season for the animals by up to a week in some areas in order to try to stabilize rising populations. Depending on the area, some hunting seasons started in late September or early October and continued through the first week of January, the newspaper said.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: People in the state remain sharply divided on whether four federal hydroelectric dams along the Snake River should be removed to help endangered salmon and orca recover, a state report concluded. The final version of the report said the dams bring benefits and liabilities to the region, and there is no clear consensus in the state on whether they should be retained. “‘They have boosted the economy and local communities in southeast Washington but have also harmed tribal and fishing communities throughout the Pacific Northwest,” said the report, released by Gov. Jay Inslee. The contentious issue of removing the dams has been kicking around the Northwest for a couple of decades and largely breaks along political lines. Republicans tend to favor keeping the dams, while Democrats tend to be more open to removing them.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: More than 200 properties in a historic district have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service approved the addition of the South Wheeling area last week, news outlets report. The area includes historic properties between 31st and 41st streets from Chapline Street to West Virginia 2. Wheeling Heritage and the Wheeling Historic Landmarks Commission oversaw the project. “South Wheeling as a historic district is important because it recognizes the industrial and vernacular architecture of Wheeling,” said Betsy Sweeny, historic preservation program manager for Wheeling Heritage. Along with giving the properites recognition, the listing makes property owners eligible for tax incentives and opportunities, such as the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, Sweeny said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Nine out of 10 students in the class of 2019 completed high school within four years, continuing an upward trend, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction reported Tuesday. The state’s graduation rate has increased 1.6% over the past five years. It is 90% in 2019, up from 89.6% in 2018 and 88.6% in 2017. There were also improvements among smaller subgroups of students, including blacks, Hispanics and those learning how to speak English. Black students in the class of 2019 graduated in four years at 71.3%, a 2-point increase from the previous year and a 7.3-point improvement over the past five years. The 82.8% graduation rate for Hispanic students increased a half-point between 2018 and 2019.

People can look over and adopt the horses at the Rock Springs Wild Horse Holding Facility this Friday and Saturday and April 24-25, the Rocket-Miner reports. Animals will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to a statement by the agency. Gates will open at 9 a.m., and load-out begins at 1 p.m. and continues until 3:30 p.m. each day. Anyone at least 18 years of age and wishing to adopt must fill out an application, have it approved by the agency and pay a $25 adoption fee for each horse, the statement said. If approved, adopters must make their own arrangements to transport the horses from the adoption facility.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/24/live-rnc-coverage-trump-speech-republican-convention-day-1/5624246002/", "title": "RNC: Republicans spent Day 1 defending Trump's virus response", "text": "Corrections and clarifications: This story has been updated to correct language about the methodology in the Morning Consult poll.

The president and many of his allies have often conflated the two groups. Many cities had protests with no riots.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIn a series of videos and remarks, some of them live and others taped, Republicans touted the president’s response to the coronavirus, promised to lift the economy back to pre-COVID levels and generally attempted to present the election as a choice between Biden and Trump rather than as a referendum on the president’s last four years.\n\n“President Trump ought to be really happy with tonight. For the most part, all speakers made a compelling, optimistic case for the party & his reelection,” Republican strategist Scott Jennings wrote on Twitter.\n\nThere were times when the evening carried the upbeat message that organizers had promised, particularly during remarks by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who drew on his personal experience to offer a vision of hope for racial reconciliation in a nation still reeling from the deaths of several Black Americans during interactions with police.\n\n\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said.\n\nBut there were also times when the speakers turned heavily critical of Biden and presented the nation under his leadership as a country steeped in chaos and socialism. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a senior campaign official and girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., warned of the Democratic \"socialist agenda.\"\n\n\"They want to destroy this country, and everything that we have fought for and hold dear. They want to steal your Liberty, your Freedom. They want to control what you See and Think, and Believe, so they can control how you live,\" Guilfoyle said. \"Don’t let the Democrats and their socialist comrades take you for granted.\"\n\nSeveral speakers tried to cast Biden and the Democrats as an existential threats to gun ownership, property rights, national security, personal wealth, and other aspects of the American Dream.\n\nSome Democrats see Trump and the Republicans in equally apocalyptic terms.\n\n“This convention is a bubbling cauldron of delusion, insanity and grievance,” tweeted political strategist and Trump critic Steve Schmidt\n\nTrue to form, Trump made two unscheduled appearances during the prime time portions of the convention: One focused on the coronavirus and the other dealing with his efforts to free Americans detained overseas. Heading into the convention, Republican strategists said Trump had to make an affirmative case on the virus given polls showing Biden leading on that issue.\n\nTrump made one appearance with front line workers, telling them that he was “for the nurses. I'm for the doctors. I'm for everybody. We have to defeat this China virus.”\n\nTime and again the convention returned to the issue of race, with a former football player admonishing those who have described the president as racist, and the Senate’s lone Black member – Scott -- attacking Biden’s past misstatements on race.\n\nFew of the speakers addressed Trump’s own remarks on race.\n\nThe recent shooting of a black man in Kenosha, Wisc., by police was not raised during the event, though Scott noted several other high-profile cases of African Americans who were killed by police.\n\n“America is not a racist country,” asserted Nikki Haley, Trump former ambassador to the U.N. and the former governor of South Carolina.\n\n— John Fritze, Courtney Subramanian and David Jackson\n\nScott slams Biden’s statements on race\n\nSen. Tim Scott ripped Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Monday for his past misstatements on race and argued that President Donald Trump’s administration rolled back many of his predecessor’s policies to help African American communities.\n\n“Joe Biden said Black people are a monolithic community. It was Joe Biden who said poor kids can be just as smart as white kids,” said Scott, a South Carolina Republican, referring to misstatements for which Biden later apologized. “And while his words are one thing, his actions take it to a whole new level.”\n\nScott’s remarks, which included much of his own personal story, were part of a broader effort during the first night of the Republican convention to blunt some of Trump’s own controversial remarks on race, including his defense of the Confederate flag and statutes honoring southern generals of the Civil War as issues of free speech as well as his frequent conflation of Black Lives Matters protests with others rioting.\n\nBut they were also an effort to call attention to some of Trump’s policies, including his decision to provide more reliable funding to historically Black colleges, tax cuts for all Americans and the pre-COVID economic growth. Scott also noted Trump’s efforts to approve a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill in 2018 – legislation raised several times during the first night of the RNC.\n\nDespite his criticism of Biden, Scott also offered one of the more hopeful messages of the evening rooted in his own history.\n\n\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said.\n\nScott, the lone Black GOP senator, has become a leading voice for Republicans on the issue of race at a time when the nation is still reeling from the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the subsequent protests that played out across the nation.\n\nScott did not mention the police shooting of Jacob Blake on Sunday, an incident that has been repeatedly replayed on cable news networks in the hours leading up to the convention. However, did name several other African Americans killed by police.\n\n“From a global pandemic, to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, 2020 has tested our nation in ways we haven’t seen for decades,” Scott said.\n\nLegislation to reform police departments largely fizzled in June. Scott blamed Democrats for that effort falling, though Democrats said the bill approved by the GOP-controlled Senate did not go far enough.\n\n“It’s about how we respond when tackling critical issues like police reform,” Scott said. “When Democrats called our work a token effort and walked out of the room during negotiations because they wanted the issue more than they wanted a solution.”\n\nScott also worked with the White House on expanding the federal Opportunity Zone program, which offers tax incentives for private investment in low-income communities. Trump frequently points to the program as the top example of his administration’s effort on behalf of cities.\n\nTrump frequently discussed the low unemployment among African Americans – and most other groups – before the coronavirus pandemic struck. But it’s not clear whether that economic message has resonated: Polls indicate Biden has overwhelming support among Black voters.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nRNC plays footage of mask-wearing Trump\n\nTrump for months had resisted wearing a mask in public until he first donned one during a visit in July at Walter Reed Hospital in suburban Maryland.\n\nBut the RNC played footage of him doing just that, during a video aired as small business owners Catalina and Madeline Lauf, two sisters from the Chicago suburbs, touted the president’s economic platform.\n\nThe snippet of the mask-wearing president, only a few seconds long, was taken from his visit last month as he toured a North Carolina facility helping develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nTrump in recent weeks has encouraged Americans to wear masks as way to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump Jr. calls Biden the `Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp’\n\nDonald Trump Jr., known for his combative and colorful social media presence, described his father’s opponent as “basically the Loch Ness Monster of the Swamp.”\n\nIn one of the top speeches of the convention’s first night, the president’s oldest son said Joe Biden has been lurking around Washington, D.C. for the past half-century.\n\n“He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn’t do much in between,” Trump Jr. said. “So if you’re looking for hope, look to the man who did what the failed Obama-Biden Administration never could do and built the greatest economy our country has ever seen.”\n\n“President Trump,” he added, “will do it again.”\n\nTrump Jr. has the highest-profile of the president’s children in his re-election campaign. He’s a top surrogate, fundraiser and messenger through social media, conservative broadcasts and the campaign’s digital shows.\n\nOn his Instagram account, Trump Jr. refers to himself as a “General in the Meme Wars.”\n\nHis high level of involvement is a change from 2016. In that campaign, he is most known for having set up the Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and a Russian lawyer that was looked into as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the election.\n\nMonday, Trump Jr. put the spotlight on China, saying the Chinese Communist Party wants “Beijing Biden” to win because he won’t be as tough on them as Trump is. He also blamed the disruption of the economy on the coronavirus – which arrived “courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party.”\n\nWhile there’s “light at the end of the tunnel” on the coronavirus under his father’s leadership, Trump Jr. said, he criticized Biden for saying in an ABC interview Sunday that if he were president, he would shut the country down to stop the spread of the coronavirus -- if that were recommended by scientists.\n\n“It’s madness,” said Trump Jr.\n\nHe accused the Democrats of imposing a “cancel” culture on the nation’s founders by tearing down monuments. And he said people of faith are under attack, being prevented from going to church while “mass chaos in the streets gets a pass.”\n\n“It’s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work, and school versus rioting, looting and vandalism,” Trump Jr. said. “Or, in the words of Biden and the Democrats, `peaceful protesting.’”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nFormer UN Ambassador Nikki Haley: America's story is a work in progress\n\nThe former UN ambassador opened her speech by quoting one of her predecessors, Ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick, who served under former President Ronald Reagan, at the 1984 GOP convention: “Democrats always blame America first.”\n\n“Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first,” Haley said. “Donald Trump has always put America first. He has earned four more years as president.”\n\nHaley, who maintained good relations with President Donald Trump since she left the administration 2018, said serving as the U.S. ambassador to the UN was “not for the faint of heart.”\n\n“It’s a place where dictators, murderers, and thieves denounce America…and then put their hands out and demand we pay their bills,” she said. “Well, President Trump put an end to all that…We stood up for America and we stood against our enemies.”\n\nHaley praised Trump for his tough stance on China and Iran and hailed the administration for moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. She said Trump had a record of “strength and success” while Biden had one of “weakness and failure.”\n\nHaley has been mentioned as a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate who could seize the party mantle. At one point, Haley was rumored as a potential candidate to replace Vice President Mike Pence on the 2020 ticket. Trump shot down the idea last year and insisted Pence would be his running mate, adding that “Nikki’s future is great.”\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who led the 2015 call to remove the Confederate flag from the State House in the wake of a racially motivated mass shooting at a Charleston church, also blasted Democrats for saying America is racist.\n\n“In much of the Democratic Party, it’s now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country,” said Haley, who spoke about growing up in the South as the daughter of Indian immigrants.\n\n“America is a story that’s a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone,” she added.\n\nHaley also reflected on the shooting at Emanuel AME Church five years ago, contending that her state “came together” after the tragic shooting.\n\n“What happened then should give us hope now,” she said. “America isn’t perfect. But the principles we hold dear are perfect. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.”\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump appears with released Americans\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a second unscheduled appearance at the Republican National Convention during prime time on Monday, this time joined by six Americans who had been detained overseas and subsequently released during his presidency.\n\nTrump appeared in the Diplomatic Reception Room with Michael White, freed by Iran in June, and Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in Turkey and released in 2018 and four others. Trump has frequently touted his effort to free Americans held in places like Iran and Syria.\n\n“We’re very proud of the job we did,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s appearance was preceded by video describing the president as a “tough and skilled negotiator.”\n\nMost of the released Americans spoke and thanked Trump for his efforts.\n\n“You took unprecedented steps to secure my release,” Brunson said. “I’m very, very grateful.”\n\nOthers joining Trump: Sam Goodwin taken into custody in Syria and released last year; Joshua and Tamara Holt, arrested in Venezuela and releaesd in 2018; and Pastor Bryan Nerran, arrested in India and released in May.\n\n“We got you all back,” Trump said. \"We have a few more people we want to get back...and they will be back very soon.\"\n\n-- John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle: America, it’s all on the line\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle, the senior campaign official and girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., declared “it’s all on the line” and that it was her duty to fight to protect the American dream as the daughter of an immigrant.\n\nBorrowing the campaign slogan used by Joe Biden, the president’s Democratic challenger, the former Fox News host said: “This election is a battle for the Soul of America. Your choice is clear.”\n\n“If you want to see the socialist Biden/Harris future for our country, just take a look at California,” she said, pointing to the home state of Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, as well as her ex-husband, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. “It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation and immaculate environment – and the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in the streets and blackouts in homes.”\n\n\"In President Trump’s America we light things up, we don’t dim them down. We build things up, we don’t burn them down. We kneel in prayer and we stand for our flag,\" said Guilfoyle, who leads the fundraising effort for the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\n“America, it's all on the line. President Trump believes in you. He emancipates and lifts you up to live your American dream,” she continued. “Stand for an American president who is fearless, who believes in you, and who loves this country and will fight for her.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nGun-toting Missouri couple backs Trump at convention against the \"radicals\" of the Left\n\nPatty and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis homeowners who drew nationwide attention for pointing guns at Black Lives Matter protestors in June, aimed their rhetorical fire Monday at the “radicals” who nominated Biden.\n\nThe couple, speaking from their home town, outlined a foreboding future under Biden, where the suburbs would be unsafe, lawless and infested with \"low-quality apartments.\"\n\n\"When we don’t have basic safety and security in our communities, we will never be free to build a brighter future for ourselves, for our children, and for our country,\" said Patty McCloskey. \"That’s what’s at stake in this election. And that’s why we must re-elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe McCloskey’s appearance comes amid Trump’s aggressive push for gun rights protections and a law-and-order agenda in the face of racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police.\n\nIn a video that went viral, the couple brandished guns outside their mansion at protesters walking on a private street on the way to demonstrating outside the St. Louis mayor's residence nearby. Both were charged in July with unlawful use of a weapon, a felony.\n\n“Whether it’s defunding the police, ending cash bail so criminals can be released back out on the streets the same day to riot again, or encouraging anarchy on our streets, it seems as if Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens,” Mark McCloskey said. “Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime. But you know who was? We were. They’ve actually charged us with a felony for daring to defend our home.”\n\nThe couple joins other prominent non-politicians who have prime-time speaking slots during the four-day convention, including former Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann, Andrew Pollack, the father of Parkland shooting victim Meadow Pollack, and anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nFather of Parkland shooting victim says another Trump term is vital to school safety\n\nThe father of a student killed in 2018 during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives said that re-electing President Donald Trump is a matter of keeping students safe in school.\n\nAndrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was 18 and a senior when she was killed, said after his daughter’s tragic death, he met with the president and got to see what a “good man and a great listener” he is.\n\n“I never wanted this to become a political spectacle but it did. And I never wanted to meet the president like this, but I did,” Pollack said in his emotional speech at the convention Monday.\n\nPollack praised Trump’s creation of a commission that put forth recommendations for schools to prevent mass shootings, which emphasized actions at the local level. The administration was criticized by Democrats at the time for suggesting that teachers should be armed. Pollack said the media “turned my daughter’s murder into a coordinated attack on President Trump, Republicans and our Second Amendment.”\n\n“I learned that gun control laws didn’t fail my daughter. People did,” Pollack said.\n\nPollack said he opposes an Obama-era policy that was meant to combat racial discrimination in disciplinary actions in schools by promoting a “restorative” approach to discipline and viewing expulsion and reports to authorities as only a last resort. The Trump administration rolled back the policy after the Parkland shooting.\n\n“I truly believe the safety of your kids depends on whether this man is re-elected. I hope you’ll join me in helping to make that happen.”\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nRNC works to defend Trump on coronavirus\n\nConvention organizers had to address the inevitable: The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic turmoil that has dragged down President Donald Trump’s poll numbers all year.\n\nThey did so with a highly produced video noting some of the president’s early efforts, including his decision to close off travel to China, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon from LSU Health Shreveport in Louisiana and a taped exchange between Trump and frontline workers in the White House.\n\n\"Trump truly moved mountains to save lives and he deserves credit,” asserted G.E. Ghali, the surgeon.\n\nHeading into the convention, Republican strategists said Trump had to make an affirmative case on the virus. Fifty-three percent of Americans believe Democrat Joe Biden would do a better job handling the coronavirus compared with 37% who feel that way about Trump, according to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll this month.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nJim Jordan rails against Democrats for response to coronavirus, protests\n\nRep. Jim Jordan echoed a familiar refrain on Monday night, criticizing Democrats for everything from impeachment to violence during protests against police brutality.\n\nJordan, R-Ohio, is a staunch ally of the president and is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, where he went to bat for Trump during the House impeachment proceedings.\n\nIn his Republican Convention speech delivered Monday just after Trump made an appearance, Jordan said “crime, violence, mob rule” are happening in Democrat-controlled cities.\n\nJordan also told an emotional story about President Donald Trump talking on the phone to Jordan’s family after his nephew died.\n\n“I love the president’s intensity and his willingness to fight every day in Washington for our families. But what I also appreciate is something most Americans never see – how much he truly cares about people,” Jordan said.\n\nJordan claimed Democrats “won’t let you go to” church, work or school, though pandemic-related shutdowns have occurred in cities across the country, in states run by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n“President Trump has fought against each of their crazy ideas,” Jordan said. “He’s taken on the swamp, all of the swamp: the Democrats, the press, and the never Trumpers.”\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\nHerschel Walker defends Trump on race\n\nFormer professional football player Herschel Walker laid out an impassioned and personal defense of President Donald Trump’s past statements on race, disputing criticism that his frequent barbs over sports figures kneeling during the national anthem have been insensitive.\n\n\"It hurts my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is 'racist,'\" said Walker, who is Black and who described his relationship with Trump as a \"deep\" friendship. \"I take it as a personal insult that people would think I've had a 37-year friendship with a racist. People who think that don't know what they're talking about.\"\n\nTouching on the controversy surrounding the national anthem, Walker said that \"just because someone loves and respects the flag…doesn’t mean they don’t care about social justice.\"\n\nWalker said that Trump \"shows how much he cares about social justice in the Black community through his actions.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized NFL players for kneeling during the anthem, which they have done to protest police brutality. Walker’s remarks, which were taped, came as the nation was processing the latest police-involved shooting of a black man: Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisc.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nTrump meets frontline workers\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a surprise appearance during the Republican National Convention on Monday to meet with front line workers dealing with the coronavirus, part of the Republican effort to push back on criticism of his response.\n\n\"We have delivered billions of dollars of equipment,\" Trump told postal workers, truck drivers, registered nurses and two police officers during the unexpected event.\n\nOne person in the small group speaking to Trump was a nursing supervisor at a hospital in New Jersey.\n\n\"I am so in awe of your leadership,\" she told him. \"It takes a true leader to ignore all that (negative) stuff and do what is right.\"\n\nTrump's response: \"I’m for the nurses. I'm for the doctors. I'm for everybody. We have to defeat this China virus.\"\n\nRNC Chair Ronna McDaniel hits Democrats for celebrity appearances\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel kicked off her remarks by slamming Democrats for opening last week’s convention with Eva Longoria, a celebrity known for her role on the television series “Desperate Housewives.”\n\n“Well, I’m actually a real housewife and a mom from Michigan with two wonderful kids in public school who happens to be only the second woman in 164 years to run the Republican party,” she said. “And unlike Joe Biden, President Trump didn’t choose me because I’m a woman – he chose me because I was the best person for the job.”\n\nMcDaniel has led the RNC since 2017 after serving as the head of the Republican Party in Michigan, a key battleground state she helped President Donald Trump carry in 2016. She took over as RNC chair on Trump’s recommendation, replacing Reince Priebus who joined the White House as the president’s chief of staff.\n\nShe’s also the niece of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and has repeatedly defended Trump against her uncle’s criticisms. Earlier this year she tweeted that she stood with Trump after Romney became the only Republican senator to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial.\n\nDuring her remarks, McDaniel criticized Democrats for focusing on their disdain for Trump rather than outlining their policies, adding that their argument for Joe Biden \"boiled down to the fact that they think he's a nice guy.\"\n\n\"Tonight begins a new chapter in the great American story. A story that has inspired the world for generations,\" she said. \"This election is the most important in our lifetime. Your vote counts more than ever.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nGaetz: Election is between a ‘visionary’ builder and a basement dweller\n\nU.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz said the contrast between the two candidates on the November ballot, praising Trump as a “visionary” who will be facing off against “basement-dwelling Joe Biden.”\n\n“Donald Trump, like all builders, is a visionary. That which is built in the mind is even more powerful than what holds it together,” Gaetz said, speaking from the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. “First comes the vision, then the work.”\n\nGaetz, 38, is a favorite of the president (they talk frequently) who aggressively went after the Democrat House members leading the impeachment inquiry last year.\n\nBiden, he said echoing a familiar Republican theme, is nothing but a tool of the far left who will “disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door,” Gaetz said. “And the police won’t be coming when you call in Democrat-run cities. They’re already being defunded (and) disbanded.”\n\nFew in Congress have been as supportive of Trump as much as the fiery congressman from the Florida panhandle (who ironically holds the seat that anti-Trump Republican and MS-NBC personality Joe Scarborough once occupied).\n\nA media-savvy congressman who has bucked the GOP by advocating for legalized marijuana, Gaetz has carved out a national profile in part from his starring role in the just-released HBO documentary, “The Swamp”.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nDemocrat for Trump\n\nGeorgia state Rep. Vernon Jones, a lifelong Democrat who is Black, said it may surprise people that he supports President Donald Trump. Jones said Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has had 47 years in public office to get results, “but he’s all talk and no action.”\n\nJones said he learned a strong work ethic from his parents while growing up in a cinder-block home with no indoor plumbing. Jones, who attended North Carolina Central University, said Trump delivered historic funding historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJones also supported Trump’s tax bill for opportunity zones to drive investment into communities. And Jones supported Trump’s criminal justice overhaul, to reduce mass incarceration that decimated Black communities.\n\nBut Jones said the Democratic Party has become infected with intolerance, bigotry and a dangerous tolerance for people who attack others and destroy property.\n\n“I was threatened, called an embarrassment, and asked to resign by my party,” Jones said after he endorsed Trump. “But I’m here to tell you that Black voices are becoming more woke and louder than ever.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nSmall businesswoman talks coronavirus stimulus\n\nThe economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic made an early appearance at the Republican National Convention on Monday in the form of a businesswoman who benefited from a bipartisan stimulus aimed at small businesses.\n\nTanya Weinreis, owner of several coffee shops in Montana, received a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, part of a broader stimulus approved by Congress, geared to help small businesses to stay afloat.\n\n“It has been a lifesaver,” said Weinreis, adding that her business was hammered by event cancellations because of the virus. \"Not only were we able keep every single employee but we've been hiring weekly ever since.”\n\nWeinreis and other non-politicos are appearing at the convention in part to tout President Donald Trump’s efforts to combat the virus and the economic fall out from it. Trump has often praised the program but the White House and Congress have so far been unable to come to an agreement on extending it.\n\nThe program expired in early August.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nKirk: Trump 'bodyguard of western civilization'\n\nEchoing the sort of dire language President Donald Trump often uses to describe his opponents, conservative activist Charlie Kirk blamed “bitter, deceitful, vengeful” opponents for the nation’s woes and described Trump as an antidote to that division.\n\n“Trump is the bodyguard of western civilization,” asserted Kirk, the 26-year-old founder of Turning Point USA.\n\nKirk’s message offered a particularly bleak view of the nation, arguing the country is “locking up pastors” while “releasing violent criminals from prison” and “kicking doctors off of social media” while “promoting Chinese state-funded propaganda” on other tech platforms.\n\nThe conservative superstar is appearing at the convention as part of an effort to help Trump capture younger voters. That constituency could be pivotal, and at the moment, polls show Trump faces a yawning gap of support among Millennials and other young voters.\n\nVoters aged 18 to 34 support Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, over the GOP ticket by 22 points, a CNN poll found this month.\n\n— John Fritze and Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump to appear at convention with Americans held overseas\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to make another appearance at the Republican National Convention on Monday -- this time joined by Americans held abroad and those detained by foreign governments released during his time in office.\n\nTrump is expected to appear with Michael White, freed by Iran in June, and Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in Turkey and released in 2018 and four others. Trump has repeatedly touted his efforts to get Americans held overseas freed.\n\nThe appearance was not included on the original RNC schedule and underlines the fact that Trump is likely to appear unexpectedly several times during the convention, as he did earlier in the day in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n— David Jackson and John Fritze\n\n‘Can't be trusted’: Michael Cohen appears in ad to run during RNC attacking president\n\nMichael Cohen, who served as Trump's loyal personal attorney and fixer, will appear in a series of Democratic group American Bridge ads with a message to voters about Trump: they \"shouldn't believe a word he utters.\"\n\n\"For more than a decade, I was President Trump's right-hand man, fixer and confidant. I was complicit in helping conceal the real Donald Trump. In essence, I was part of creating an illusion,\" Cohen says. \"Later this week, he's going to stand up at the White House and blatantly lie to you.\"\n\nCohen continues, \"I'm here to tell you he can't be trusted -- and you shouldn't believe a word he utters. So, when you watch the President this week, remember this: If he says something is huge, it's probably small. If he says something will work, it probably won't. And if he says he cares about you and your family, he certainly does not.\"\n\nThe series of ads will run during the Republican National Convention this week, starting digitally on Monday and appearing on TV starting Wednesday, according to CNN.\n\nCohen comes as the latest anti-Trump Republican to speak out just before the start of the RNC. Former Republican Party chairman Michael Steele joined the Lincoln Project just hours ago, and 27 former GOP lawmakers publicly endorsed Democratic nominee Joe Biden Monday morning.\n\nMatt Wolking, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told USA TODAY in response, \"If you believe anything Michael Cohen says, I have a basement in Delaware to sell you.\"\n\nCohen, a self-described Trump fixer, pleaded guilty to coordinating payoffs to buy the silence of adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. The women said they had sexual affairs with Trump before he was elected. Cohen insisted he acted at the direction of Trump, who has denied the affairs.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nWho is Charlie Kirk?\n\nOne of the first speakers of tonight's RNC event is expected to be Charlie Kirk, the 26-year-old conservative darling who is a Trump family confidant and the head of Turning Point USA, which is devoted to attracting and energizing young voters.\n\nKirk bills himself as \"Twitter's 5th most engaged personality\" and a vessel for the GOP to reach coveted college-age voters.\n\n“I visit college campuses so you don’t have to,” Kirk told an approving crowd at the Conservative Political Action's 2020 conference. \"You're welcome.\"\n\nBy the time the 2016 election rolled around, Turning Point was a well-funded outfit and Kirk had become increasingly influential. He met Donald Trump Jr. at the GOP convention that year and glued himself to the president's eldest son.\n\n“I traveled the country for about 70 days straight carrying Donald Trump Jr.’s bags and getting his Diet Cokes,” Kirk told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in 2019. “Helping book flights and taking pictures and coordinating media, essentially being the youth director of the campaign and also being Don Jr.’s body man.”\n\nNow, Kirk enjoys influence and access at the highest levels of the White House, said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist with close ties to the Trump campaign.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nRNC faces news distractions on Day 1\n\nThe Republicans are eager for news coverage of their convention starting Monday –but they're getting a lot of competition from news breaking all over the country.\n\nThe opening night of the GOP convention starts at 8:30 p.m. EST. Maybe nothing more will happen before then.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nPoll: Trump trailing Biden in North Carolina\n\nA new poll released just hours after the Republican National Convention opened Monday in Charlotte shows President Donald Trump losing to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in North Carolina.\n\nTrump trails the former vice president by three points (46% to 49%) in the Tar Heel State and by 10 points nationally (42% to 52%), according to the Morning Consult poll.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina in 2016, beating Democrat Hillary Clinton by four points (50% to 46%). North Carolina is expected to be a pivotal swing state again this year.\n\nThe poll of 1,541 likely voters in North Carolina was conducted Aug. 14-23 and has a two-point margin of error.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump: Unlike Biden, ‘I showed up’\n\nPresident Donald Trump followed his unscheduled stop at the Republican National Convention in Charlotte on Monday by visiting a company in the battleground state that helps distribute surplus farm food to families in need.\n\nThe president toured a warehouse at the Flavor First Growers and Packers in Mills River, which boxes surplus food and distributes it through the Farmers to Families Food Boxes program. It was the latest indication that Trump intends to stay highly visible during the four-day convention, much of which is taking place virtually.\n\n\"This really is an incredible program,\" Trump said, standing in front of stacks of boxes filled peppers, eggplant, squash and other fruits and vegetables.\n\nLater, Trump announced that his administration is authorizing another $1 billion for the program. Many families found themselves in need of groceries when the coronavirus pandemic hit, he said.\n\nThough not an official campaign stop, the event sometimes had the feel of a political rally, with the crowd chanting \"four more years!\" Trump encouraged supporters to get out and vote in November, calling it \"the most important election this country has ever had.\"\n\nTrump also got in a dig at Democratic Joe Biden for not traveling to Wisconsin during the Democratic National Convention. Milwaukee was scheduled to host the gathering, but Democrats switched to a virtual gathering as a result of COVID.\n\n\"Joe Biden was supposed to be in Wisconsin, but he never showed up,\" Trump said. \"I showed up.\"\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTrump formally accepts nomination\n\nPresident Donald Trump was formally nominated for a second term at the Republican National Convention on Monday, marking an official start to this year's presidential race and the first major moment of the party's meeting this week.\n\nTrump made a surprise visit to the convention shortly after crossing the threshold of delegates needed for the nod. He started off his remarks with an attack on Democrats, opponent Joe Biden and criticism of mail-in ballots – an indication his message at the party's convention will mirror what he has been eager to convey in the run up to it.\n\nMore:Trump formally nominated for second term at Republican National Convention\n\n\"This is the most important election in the history of our country,\" Trump said during nearly an hour of remarks at the Charlotte Convention Center. \"This is the biggest.\"\n\nTrump was set to hold several campaign events in North Carolina before returning to Washington in the evening. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., was among several speakers expected during the prime time hours. Others include Donald Trump Jr., Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.\n\n– John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/13/holy-water-drop-foster-pet-boom-super-spreader-news-around-states/111541518/", "title": "Holy water drop, foster pet boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTroy: Troy University has five 3D printers running 24/7 making protective equipment for health care workers, and the college is asking anyone who owns a 3D printer to help with the effort. Usually the college’s 3D printers are used for art and design projects, but faculty, staff and students are printing N95 masks, face shields and other needed equipment to protect from the coronavirus. The protective equipment is being distributed wherever there is a need. Volunteers can make masks from home. The primary print at Troy has been reusable face shield-headbands. They can be quickly sanitized, and the shields can be replaced with readily available items such as copier, printer or overhead transparency sheets. “Any relatively thick, clear plastic that can accept a three hole punch,” said Jeff Herring, producer and director for Troy Broadcast and Digital Network.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: About 70 tribes in the state have implemented travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, limiting incoming air, land and water traffic in remote villages scattered across Alaska. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has given communities regulation leeway through their councils and other governmental entities, so travel restrictions vary throughout the state, Indian Country Today reports. Essential workers and their necessary travel are still permitted. “But the less mixing we have going on at this point, the more we slow the virus down,” Dunleavy said. Residents of the Northwest Alaska Inupiat village of Kivalina, population 379, who want to leave must notify the tribal administrator of departure and return dates and the reason for the trip and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return, community leaders said. Those rules apply to travel by flights and snowmobile, as the village is not connected by road to any other community, leaders said.\n\nArizona\n\nPage: The number of coronavirus cases on the nation’s largest Native American reservation jumped jumped by 17% Saturday as the Navajo Nation prepared to get new rapid-test kits. The Navajo Nation said in a statement that the number of cases on the 27,000-square-mile reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah rose to 698 Saturday, up 101 from the day before. So far, a total of 24 people have died from complications of COVID-19. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer said they have been told that Abbott ID rapid test kits will become available at Navajo Area IHS facilities and tribal health care centers in the next few days. The tests come out with results within several minutes, they said. “Quicker test results will likely result in even higher numbers of positive cases, but it will help to identify those who have the virus and begin to mitigate the cases much quicker. We must do better,” Nez said.\n\nArkansas\n\nGrady: The first state prisoner in Arkansas has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, a prison spokeswoman said Sunday. A man being held at the Cummins Unit in Grady, about 75 miles south east of Little Rock, was transferred to a hospital Saturday and tested positive for COVID-19, Arkansas Department of Corrections spokeswoman Dina Tyler said in a statement. She declined to provide further information on the man. Other prisoners and staff who were exposed to the man have been tested for the virus, and access to his housing unit has been restricted. Tyler said that 13 corrections employees were quarantined Friday after testing positive. As of Saturday, 1,228 people in Arkansas have tested positive for COVID-19, and 25 with the disease have died, according to figures from the state Department of Health. Almost 350 people have recovered.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will help skilled nursing facilities wracked by the new virus by providing additional bed space for their patients on a Navy hospital ship and shipping masks and gloves for their workers, the governor said Friday. The state will also help track the virus in more than 1,000 facilities and isolate those who test positive, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. The announcements came as Newsom warned that skilled nursing facilities are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus and that more than 1,200 residents and staff had tested positive. Another 370 people at small, home-based facilities also have the virus, he said. “Skilled nursing facilities continue to be a top priority,” Newsom said in a daily briefing. “This state has a disproportionate number of aging and graying individuals, and we have a unique responsibility to take care of them and take care of their caregivers.”\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A beef plant in northern Colorado where dozens of employees have tested positive for COVID-19 has been shut down through Tuesday for deep cleaning and to screen additional workers. Andre Nogueira, JBS USA’s CEO, said in a statement released Friday that the company is paying more than $1 million for thousands of testing kits for workers at the Greeley plant. He said 36 employees have tested positive for the disease. Weld County’s health department said concerns at the facility include the proximity of workers to each other and employees working while they are sick. If the plant does not comply with the county’s public health order, it could be closed, but compliance is the “preferred solution,” the statement said. On Tuesday, Nogueira told The Greeley Tribune he was confident workers inside the plant were safe from the virus and strongly disputed claims by employees that people were going to work sick.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Landlords are raising concerns about Gov. Ned Lamont’s latest executive order, which automatically grants tenants a 60-day grace period for rent due in April and the opportunity for a second 60-day grace period to help those struggling to pay for housing during the coronavirus pandemic. Rick Bush, a West Hartford landlord who owns 38 units and manages 165 more, predicted renters will never be able to catch up on those delayed payments, leaving many landlords in a financial predicament. In a good economy, Bush estimated only 10% to 15% of renters typically pay off their back, unpaid rent. He said he’d like the state’s congressional delegation to propose a new federal loan program for renters that would enable landlords to still get paid and cover their own expenses, including mortgages. Numerous landlords on Bush’s Facebook page echoed his concerns Friday, predicting Lamont’s order will put them over the financial edge.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Gov. John Carney on Saturday unveiled a new effort to recruit workers with health care or child care experience amid the coronavirus pandemic. Carney’s office said in a news release that the state has launched an online application portal to recruit workers with those credentials to fill critical jobs. “We need all Delaware citizens, businesses, and nonprofits to support Delaware’s response to COVID-19. If you have experience in health care or child care especially, please sign up … and help us fill critical positions,” he said. Applications will be reviewed by the Delaware Division of Public Health and shared with institutions in need across the state, the news release said. The governor’s office also said anyone licensed or certified to work in child care or education was encouraged to submit their information for potential temporary employment by emergency child care sites.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With new rules in place, fish market vendors at The Wharf once again opened their stands Saturday, ready to sell to buyers lining up around the corner, WUSA-TV reports. Vendors were forced to implement new safety regulations after images of an overcrowded market with no social distancing went viral the prior weekend. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser enacted an emergency closure in response, saying vendors would only be allowed to reopen once they submitted a new safety plan to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for approval. On Thursday, she implemented a new rule that said farmers’ markets were no longer considered essential businesses, and they would have to obtain a waiver to operate. The National Guard and D.C. police were out manning the lines Saturday, making sure customers were following the new rules.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Members of the Florida National Guard have started on-the-spot testing of residents at nursing homes for the new coronavirus as long-term care facilities in the state have reported scores of cases, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday. Guardsmen have conducted tests of residents and staff at nursing homes in South Florida, and UF Health Shands has done other spot-testing at facilities, DeSantis said. “We want to continue to do that, given that is the most high-risk population,” the governor said. In Clay County, in the Jacksonville area, 49 cases have been reported at long-term care facilities, and 51 cases among residents and staff have been reported at a nursing home in Suwannee County, halfway between Jacksonville and Tallahassee. Statewide, there were almost 840 coronavirus cases in residents and staff at long-term care facilities as of Saturday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has now surpassed 12,000, with the death toll at 432. The Georgia Department of Public Health reported an additional 400 cases and seven deaths Saturday. The total number of cases now stands at more than 12,250. Roughly 20% of those patients are hospitalized. Gov. Brian Kemp has issued a statewide stay-at-home order lasting through the end of April, but houses of worship are still allowed to hold services as long as congregants remain 6 feet apart. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state of Hawaii said Friday that it wants travelers to use an online program to provide information about their travel plans to help authorities enforce a 14-day coronavirus quarantine imposed on people arriving in the islands. The program asks travelers to provide a name, phone number, flight information and address where they will be staying. Until now the state has had travelers fill out paper forms with this information. The number of travelers flying to Hawaii has dropped dramatically since Gov. David Ige announced the quarantine order in late March. But hundreds continue to arrive. On Thursday, 663 people arrived, including 107 visitors and 171 residents. Travelers using the online program will be asked to check in daily to attest they are at their quarantine location and to answer questions about their health. The program does not currently have the ability to check a traveler’s location using cellphone GPS.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s congressional delegation wants the U.S. Department of Energy to prepare spent nuclear fuel for trucking out of eastern Idaho ahead of a 2035 deadline. The two Republican senators and two Republican representatives in the letter sent last week said the department could be readying the spent fuel for placement in protective trucking containers. A 1995 agreement following a series of federal lawsuits requires the Energy Department to remove most of the spent fuel and other nuclear waste from the site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. “We encourage the Department to initiate activities needed to begin loading of spent nuclear fuel into a multi-purpose canister (MPC) at the Idaho National Laboratory using existing facilities,” the lawmakers wrote. However, the U.S. has no long-term storage facility to receive radioactive spent fuel. The creation of such a repository would require action by the Trump administration, Congress and states.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has recently been using his clemency power to commute sentences for some prisoners amid the coronavirus outbreak. Pritzker granted commutations for 17 Illinois inmates since March 11, the Chicago Tribune reports. Basil Powell, who was imprisoned in 1986 for being the lookout in two robberies, was one of those prisoners. A tough-on-crime sentencing law that labeled him a repeat offender led to his life sentence after his conviction. But reform advocates fought for his release due to their concern regarding elderly and sick inmates during the outbreak, and he was released Thursday. “I feel good, like a thousand bricks got up off my shoulders,” Powell said in a telephone interview. Pritzker also commuted the life sentence of Charles Harris, 58, who was convicted of armed robbery and serving a mandatory life term under the habitual criminal law. He had been in prison since 1988 and was released Wednesday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In record numbers, central Indiana residents have been seeking companionship from dogs as they ride out the COVID-19 pandemic in their homes. Shelters report large increases in the number of four-legged fosters since stay-at-home orders took effect. “There’s nothing better than a cuddly pet at home when you are self-isolating,” said David Horth, chief executive officer of the Humane Society of Indianapolis. He said the short-term adoptions of pandemic pooches are mutually beneficial: They give the animals a respite from hectic and quickly crowding shelters and provide their humans comfort or a distraction in a stressful time. It also helps that the shelters provide food and medication at a time residents are feeling economic hardship. Though shelters have a steady base of repeat foster parents, officials said the majority of temporary adopters now are first-timers.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Health care providers facing a shortage of personal protective equipment must extend the use of their face masks, use washable gowns and shorten hospital stays for some coronavirus patients, the Iowa Department of Public Health said Friday. The agency directed hospitals to take extraordinary steps to conserve limited supplies of critical masks, gowns, shields, goggles and respirators. “We understand the issuance of this order may be unsettling, but due to the global shortage of PPE supply, we have determined that now is the time to take this action,” the department’s deputy director, Sarah Reisetter, said at a news conference. Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state’s requests for equipment from the now-depleted national stockpile have been delayed, and state and local agencies and providers have struggled to procure adequate supplies. Advocates for health care workers said they were alarmed by the shortage, which comes about two or three weeks before Iowa’s COVID-19 caseload is expected to peak.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Authorities are investigating a spike in people impersonating law enforcement officers. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Friday that it has identified about 10 reports of suspected law enforcement impersonations in the past several weeks in multiple counties. There have no reports of injuries or thefts. The KBI says the impersonator often questions whether the driver’s travel is “essential” or asks for workplace documentation. The Kansas stay-at-home order doesn’t require people to carry or a letter, identification card or other paper proving they are allowed to leave their home. The KBI says people who are concerned they are the target of an impersonator should slow down, activate their hazard lights, and call 911 to confirm it is a legitimate law enforcement stop.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The University of Louisville has developed a process for sterilizing N95 respirators and will soon begin cleaning up to 7,000 masks daily for area health care facilities. N95 respirators are essential to protecting the health of nurses, doctors and others who work in direct contact with coronavirus patients, and they’ve become increasingly difficult to find amid the global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the masks not be reused in emergency situations. But Leslie Sherwood, assistant vice president for research services at U of L, said the university has found a way to decontaminate the masks using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, allowing health care professionals to use them again. “Unfortunately, we know that folks working in health care are having higher incidents of being infected because they’re constantly being bombarded with the virus,” Mayor Greg Fischer said Saturday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The archbishop of New Orleans sprinkled holy water from a World War II-era biplane high above the city in an unusual Good Friday blessing for those affected by the coronavirus. The open-air plane carried Archbishop Gregory Aymond, 70, from the Lakefront Airport to Kenner, to Gretna, to the French Quarter over 25 minutes, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Aymond prayed for protection and healing and sprinkled holy water that came from the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized. “When I first did it, the water came back on me,” Aymond said, “but then I got situated.” Aymond recently recovered from the virus himself and said he asked God to offer grace in particular to health care workers, first responders and city leaders. The archdiocese has canceled all Masses indefinitely due to social distancing requirements. Rabbi Lexi Erdheim, 29, of the Congregation Gates of Prayer Synagogue in Metairie, went up in the same plane after Aymond to offer a blessing during Passover. “It was really powerful, seeing everything at once,” she said, “especially after being inside the same four walls for so long.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A traveling salesperson helped spread the coronavirus in Maine and several other states early in the outbreak last month, the leader of the Maine Center for Disease Control said. The salesperson was a so-called super spreader, a single person responsible for a significant number of exposures to the virus, said Dr. Nirav Shah, the center’s director. “This traveling salesperson visited a particular establishment in Maine and had a series of meetings and infected a certain number of individuals, all of whom we traced,” Shah said. The person was linked to infections outside Maine, as well, Shah said. He declined to release details, citing privacy concerns. The discovery highlights how the spread of the coronavirus can often be traced to individuals and gatherings. One of the concerns is that the virus can be easily spread by infected people who are not showing symptoms.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced steps Friday to address a huge potential state revenue loss of up to $2.8 billion this fiscal year as a result of the coronavirus and to strongly urge voters to cast ballots by mail in the state’s June 2 primary. Hogan said the projected revenue loss would represent a 50% drop in projected revenues over the next 90 days and up to a 15% reduction in revenues for the fiscal year that ends July 1. As a result, Hogan said the state is immediately instituting a budget freeze across state government agencies, except for COVID-19-related expenses and payroll. The governor said his budget office will be making recommendations for spending reductions, which will be required by all state agencies. “In addition, the state will be tapping into and spending much of – perhaps even all of – the state’s rainy day fund balance,” Hogan said. That fund is estimated at $1.2 billion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are holding a virtual public hearing Monday on a bill designed to provide short-term economic relief for families in deep poverty, vulnerable children and people with disabilities. The bill would provide a one-time additional benefit to those who receive help through the state’s transitional aid to families with dependent children program. The cost of the one-time infusion of money is pegged at $17 million in the bill. The legislation would also set aside $6 million for an additional one-time benefit under the state’s program for emergency aid to the elderly, disabled and children. The goal is to offer help to the state’s most vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. The hearing scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. will mark the first time a piece of legislation has received a virtual public hearing. The hearing will be conducted over Zoom.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Hundreds of city workers, including dozens of police officers, have been able to quickly return to work after being quarantined or have avoided quarantine altogether thanks to a speedy new test for the coronavirus. Over the past week or so, more than 1,000 city employees – including officers, firefighters, paramedics and bus drivers – have been given 15-minute nasal swab tests before starting their shifts. Mayor Mike Duggan’s office said 990 of those tested did not have COVID-19, while 140 tested positive. Testing on police officers showed 307 were negative, and 45 were positive. Before the test – developed by suburban Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories – first responders would have been sent home for several days or even weeks until results from slower tests showed whether they had the virus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: One of the premier medical facilities in the country and the state’s largest private employer on Friday announced a series of cost-cutting measures to deal with a proposed $3 billion loss in 2020. Rochester’s Mayo Clinic is instituting across-the-board pay cuts and furloughs, a result of the financial strain caused by the coronavirus crisis. The moves follow the clinic’s decision last month to halt elective surgeries and procedures to conserve supplies for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients. Mayo Clinic’s chief executive, Gianrico Farrugia, said in a statement that he supports steps being taken by the state to control the spread, including the extension this week of a stay-at-home order. Republican state Sen. Carla Nelson, of Rochester, said she will seek financial relief for the medical center she said has sacrificed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Many churches held online services Sunday to celebrate Easter and to help people maintain distance from one another to try to slow the spread of the new coronavirus as the state’s death toll from COVID-19 approaches 100. The Rev. S.V. Adolph Jr., pastor of First Missionary Baptist Church Handsboro, said on Facebook Live that he misses greeting and embracing congregants at the Gulfport sanctuary, but he is grateful about “leaving the walls of the church” and worshipping online. He also prayed for health care providers, law enforcement officers and others working during the pandemic. “We are really grateful for these heroes, these people who are at risk for our sake,” Adolph said. Figures released by the state Health Department on Sunday showed Mississippi had at least 2,781 confirmed cases and 96 deaths from the virus as of Saturday evening. That was an increase of 139 cases and three deaths from the previous day.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Gov. Mike Parson on Friday signed a supplemental budget bill allocating nearly $6 billion in federal stimulus money to fight the health and economic ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. The money will be used to purchase additional personal protective equipment for first responders, help develop medical facilities beyond traditional hospitals, and provide aid to hard-hit local governments, Parson said during a news conference. He also announced he was establishing a working group led by state Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick to help decide how the money will be spent. Both Parson and Fitzpatrick are Republicans. Meanwhile, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft asked some employees to return to the agency’s office in Jefferson City on Monday to help keep up with an increasing workload. Only people with offices will be asked to come to work, excluding those with preexisting health conditions.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The superintendent of the state’s schools told districts Friday to expect to finish out the school year with distance learning amid the coronavirus outbreak. While Gov. Steve Bullock is making coronavirus policy decisions in two-week time frames, Superintendent Elsie Arntzen said she believes school leaders would like more certainty in planning the rest of the academic year. Montana’s school closures and stay-at-home orders currently run through April 24. Even if they are lifted, Arntzen said she expects social distancing guidelines will remain in place, possibly into the summer. “We encourage you to postpone graduation ceremonies until later in the year or come up with alternative plans to honor your graduates, ensuring equity in recognition for all students, including special education students,” Arntzen wrote in a letter to schools.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has barred people from camping overnight at state parks, state recreation areas and wildlife management areas as part of the effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. The ban runs through May 8, with a possible extension. The closure of state park area lodging and cabins will be extended through May 8 as well. State parks and recreation areas will remain open for day use. A limited number of restrooms will be available and will be disinfected regularly, the commission said. Refunds will be given to campers who have prepaid fees.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The sweeping impacts of the coronavirus outbreak across the state now include cancellation of the annual Burning Man festival. Burning Man Project officials on Friday announced cancellation of the annual event that was scheduled to be held Aug. 30 to Sept. 7 in the northern Nevada desert. Organizers of Burning Man, a lifestyle and entertainment gathering that typically attracts 80,000 people, said in a Facebook post the cancellation was “in the interest of the health and well-being of our community.” The organizers said in an online journal post that “we are heartbroken. We know you are too.” Organizers said they were committed to providing refunds for tickets already purchased, but they asked purchasers to consider foregoing refunds because the organization faces layoffs, pay cuts and other belt-tightening measures.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s child welfare agency is offering new resources to help children, parents and other caregivers during the COVID-19 crisis. The state Division for Children, Youth, and Families has published a guide with advice and resources for financial assistance, food, housing and more. It also includes tips on how to check in with families and a list of questions to ask caregivers and children. The division, along with the social service agency Waypoint, also has created the “Family Support Warm Line.” The free, confidential phone line will connect callers with professionals who can offer coping strategies and emotional support. The number is 1-800-640-6486. DCYF Director Joseph Ribsam says new child abuse and neglect referrals have dropped during the pandemic, likely because children are away from school officials who often report suspected cases. He says the focus must remain on prevention.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The governor said Sunday that some models suggest the state’s coronavirus crisis is reaching its peak, but others indicate the worst impact may still be weeks away. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy told CNN health care recovery must occur before economic recovery takes place, and he’s concerned that reopening and relaxing social distancing too early could backfire. “And I fear, if we open up too early, and we have not sufficiently made that health recovery and cracked the back of this virus, that we could be pouring gasoline on the fire, even inadvertently,” Murphy said. The governor said his administration devoted significant attention over the weekend to planning about how to keep people safe once restrictions begin to be lifted. Murphy told CBS he supports a regional approach to reopening and has been having “discussions with our neighboring states on the whole question of testing, contact tracing, what are the rules of the road going to be for things like bars and restaurants.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A philanthropic effort aimed at boosting access to scarce medical and protective equipment supplies on the Navajo Nation is being organized by former Gov. Bill Richardson. Richardson, a former U.N. ambassador, said his enduring sense of gratitude and friendship with the Navajo people prompted him to provide seed money and launch the humanitarian effort in cooperation with Molina Healthcare and the New Mexico Children’s Foundation. “So many Navajo elders are vulnerable to this virus because they don’t have masks; they don’t have protective equipment,” he said. Richardson fears the pandemic could reach a vast scale of suffering reminiscent of the forced removal in the 19th century of Navajos in the “Long Walk.” Thousands endured cold, disease and starvation in the U.S. government’s attempt to relocate them to a desolate tract of land hundreds of miles away in eastern New Mexico. In 1868, they signed a treaty with the federal government to secure a return to their homeland. Richardson credited New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a fellow Democrat, with “getting ahead of this crisis.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The coronavirus crisis is taxing the city’s 911 system like never before. Operators pick up a new call every 15.5 seconds. Panicked voices tell of loved ones in declining health. There are multitudes of cardiac arrests and respiratory failures and others who call needing reassurance that a mere sneeze isn’t a sign they’ve been infected. The system is so overwhelmed that the city has started sending text and tweet alerts urging people only to call 911 “for life-threatening emergencies.” As the city staggered through its deadliest week of the pandemic, its emergency response system and army of operators, dispatchers and ambulance crews is being pushed to the brink. The fire department said it has averaged more than 5,500 ambulance requests each day – about 40% higher than usual, eclipsing the total call volume Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A study by a housing nonprofit found nearly 1 in 4 Charlotte-area tenants have missed rent payments due the first week of April as the economy shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The figures, from a national study by the National Multifamily Housing Council, represent an 8% rise in missed payments from the same time last year. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group used rental market data from firms including RealPage, which analyzed local figures for The Charlotte Observer. In the Raleigh-Cary area, close to 1 in 5 tenants missed their April rent payments. The national average was nearly 1 in 3, according to the study, which analyzed only market-rate apartments, not subsidized apartments or rental houses. Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Harden told the Observer that this situation should “keep every elected official awake at night.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Some companies in the state have switched gears amid the coronavirus outbreak to make products in short supply, from germ-killing hand cleaner to machines that assist breathing. A Fargo tech company has retooled to make much-needed ventilators, while entrepreneurs and distilleries are racing to make hand sanitizer, which has become hard to find amid the outbreak. Business owners said the shift has helped keep revenue flowing and people employed. And it fills a critical need as the number of people testing positive for the coronavirus continues to climb in North Dakota. “In reality, what we are doing now is the most important thing at this time,” said Joel Kath, owner of Proof Artisan Distillers in Fargo, which has shifted from making whiskey, bourbon, vodka and gin to hand sanitizer. Appareo Systems – which specializes in tech systems for aerospace, agriculture and defense – is aiming to provide 2,000 low-cost ventilators to the state by the end of the month, with employees working around the clock at its Fargo factory, said April Steffan, the company’s marketing director.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As the state fields record unemployment claims, many workers out of a job find themselves scrambling to make ends meet as they wait days or weeks for their claim to be processed and checks to be issued. Nearly 700,000 people filed for unemployment in the past three weeks, the state Department of Job and Family Services said Thursday, almost double the 364,603 claims filed in all of 2019. The 226,007 claims filed for the week ending April 4 marked the second consecutive week that claims topped 200,000. Ohio has paid more than $124 million so far to more than 195,000 people with claims. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said hundreds have been added to the state call center to handle all the inquires, but he has repeatedly asked people to be patient. People will receive checks for work lost from the day they were laid off, regardless of how long it takes to process the claim, he promised.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The death toll from COVID-19 neared triple digits Saturday as the state takes measures to curb spread of the disease. Six more coronavirus deaths were reported by the Oklahoma State Department of Health, bringing the state death count to 94. About 1,900 people have tested positive for COVID-19, with about 450 needing to go to the hospital. The state has enough available hospital beds, intensive-care unit beds and ventilators to handle even the worst-case predictions for a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations, Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a news conference Friday. The disease has started to break out in state prisons. Stitt approved early release for 450 inmates in an effort reduce crowding after the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed among prison workers and an inmate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two large health care operations in the state are furloughing employees and cutting costs because of a lack of revenue due to the coronavirus outbreak, furthering cuts to medical facilities in the state. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Oregon Clinic has furloughed about 820 employees. The Portland Clinic, another physician-owned chain, furloughed 180 employees and cut the pay and hours of 250 others last week. Gov. Kate Brown on March 17 ordered that all elective and non-urgent medical procedures be canceled or rescheduled until at least June 15 to preserve masks and other protective equipment for the state’s COVID-19 response. Richard Jamison, president of The Oregon Clinic, said the company has suffered an 80% decline in revenue. The Portland Clinic’s inpatient revenue has fallen by 90%, said Dick Clark, president of the operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says the state labor department has started sending out expanded federal unemployment compensation payments provided by the coronavirus relief package approved by Congress. The measure temporarily provides an additional $600 per week and makes self-employed, independent contractors and gig workers eligible for benefits. It also extends unemployment compensation benefits for an additional 13 weeks. The federal benefits are in addition to Pennsylvania’s regular unemployment benefit, which is about half of a person’s full-time weekly income up to $572 per week for 26 weeks. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry issued the first $600 payments Friday, and officials said eligible people who filed biweekly claims for the week ending April 4 and who received their regular unemployment compensation payment should expect to see the additional money either Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed is supporting a proposal that would give a salary boost to front-line workers, including nurses, grocery story workers, cleaning staff and letter carriers. The Rhode Island Democrat told WPRI-TV on Saturday that the country should reward those who put their health at risk to help fight COVID-19. The proposal would provide a $25,000 hazard pay increase for those who make less than $200,000 a year. Those who make more than $200,000 would be capped at an additional $5,000. It would also offer a $15,000 essential worker recruitment incentive to help attract and retain workers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Expressing frustration that police officers – charged with enforcing Gov. Henry McMaster’s stay-at-home order during the coronavirus outbreak – are not being told which businesses have been granted permission to stay open, the mayor of the capital city said he was pursuing an open-records request to obtain the information. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said Friday that he was filing a Freedom of Information Act request for the records, which he said his office has been seeking for several days, so officers know when a business is out of compliance with closure directives. Benjamin said the city receives daily reports from citizens regarding businesses they think are operating outside the confines of the governor’s orders. “Our officers and our fire personnel are dealing with important issues every single day,” Benjamin said. “We can’t run the risk of wasting their time chasing down a complaint that a nonessential business is open, only to show up, and that business presents us with an email from the governor’s office, saying that they’ve been exempted.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Smithfield Foods announced Sunday that it is closing its pork processing plant in Sioux Falls until further notice after hundreds of employees tested positive for the coronavirus – a step the head of the company warned could hurt the nation’s meat supply. The announcement came a day after Gov. Kristi Noem and Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken wrote to Smithfield and urged the company to suspend operations for 14 days so that its workers could self-isolate and the plant could be disinfected. The plant, which employs about 3,700 people in the state’s largest city, has become a hot spot for infections. Health officials said Sunday that 293 of the 730 people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in South Dakota work at the plant. Smithfield announced a three-day closure last week so it could sanitize the plant and install physical barriers to enhance social distancing. But on Sunday, it announced the plant’s indefinite closure.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s top health officials on Friday released some data on confirmed coronavirus cases in the state’s nursing homes but refrained from saying whether patients had died at those facilities. The decision came a few weeks after more than 100 people tested positive for the virus at one nursing home, resulting in more than 10 deaths since. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services completed an investigation at the Gallatin Center for Rehabilitation and Healing last Monday, and the survey results are forthcoming, according to the federal agency. “It is up to the facility, be it the hospital or a long-term care facility, to disclose fatalities among patients or residents,” said Shelley Walker, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, an agency that has been hesitant to release detailed data during the virus outbreak in Tennessee. However, Sumner Regional Medical Center spokesman Kyle Brogdon said Friday that the hospital – which had been treating the Gallatin nursing home residents from the outbreak – would no longer provide information about deaths of patients from the facility because the nursing home had since been reopened.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state continued to brace over the weekend for a surge in hospital visits driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Officials in Harris County unveiled a temporary overflow hospital that will be able to help take on patients during a heightened onslaught of COVID-19. Medical workers and journalists were taken on a tour of the as-yet-unopened facility on Saturday, the day the U.S. eclipsed Italy for the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world, surpassing 20,000. Harris County is the state’s most populous with more than 4.2 million residents. “We still haven’t reached the peak,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county’s highest elected official, told reporters Saturday. Hidalgo added the field hospital won’t be used until a sharp increase in coronavirus patients starts taxing existing hospital systems, which she expects to become an issue in the Houston area in two or three weeks. The overflow shelter at Houston’s NRG Park, where the Houston Texans play, will initially have 250 beds with a capacity of 2,000. Officials are setting up a similar overflow unit in Dallas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials started using an emergency alert system Friday to send text messages to drivers entering the state, asking them to report any virus symptoms and a recent travel history. The state declared truck drivers exempt from the system. Hundreds of thousands of truckers enter the state each day carrying essential supplies for grocery stores and medical facilities. Paul Enos, CEO of the Nevada Trucking Association, said the system could interrupt interstate trips and be invasive to drivers who sometimes travel through multiple states a day. Utah officials have said they aren’t punishing people who don’t fill out the online form. “We don’t want to do anything to inhibit commerce … especially right now with our supply-chain issues,” Utah Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson said. Truckers were still expected to receive the message, and there were no immediate plans to change the wording on the form to list the exemptions, which also included police, border residents, and airline personnel and passengers.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Farmers’ markets must remain closed under Gov. Phil Scott’s state-of-emergency order. The markets had lobbied to be considered essential businesses like grocery stores, but agriculture secretary Anson Tebbetts said the businesses must stay closed during the state of emergency, which extends through May 15. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Peter Welch is expressing frustration that dairy farmers aren’t getting any immediate relief from the $2 trillion stimulus package. The package, which was approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, is meant to help individuals and businesses harmed by the spread of the coronavirus. Welch said farms should be eligible for the $10,000 Small Business Administration emergency loans available to most other businesses, Vermont Public Radio reports. Milk prices have plummeted as the pandemic keeps schools and restaurants closed.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Nearly 2,000 prisoners with a year or less remaining on their sentences could be eligible for early release under a proposal from Gov. Ralph Northam designed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Northam announced Friday at a news conference that he is adding an amendment to the state budget that would give the Department of Corrections authority to release inmates with one year or less remaining on their sentences. Northam said only inmates who exhibited good behavior and do not pose a threat to the public would be released. The plan would not go into effect unless the General Assembly approved the amendment at its upcoming April 22 session. In the meantime, Northam said the administration would work on the logistics of such a release, which he said would be a significant undertaking. Inmates scheduled for release are usually placed on reentry plans to ensure details including they have somewhere to go when they are released, he said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Health authorities battling the coronavirus outbreak are trying to figure out how and when social distancing restrictions that have shut down many things across the state can be modified or ended. “That’s what a lot of us are working on now: What’s the end game?” said Dr. Elizabeth Halloran, an infectious-disease specialist and modeler at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who advises the federal government on outbreaks. “What can we do short of keeping everything shut down for 18 months or longer until we have a vaccine?” While an influential University of Washington model suggests deaths and hospitalizations may have peaked in the state, health officials say lifting restrictions too soon could cause cases to surge. The Seattle Times reports the basic approach to controlling COVID-19 is to identify infected people, as well as those who have been exposed, and isolate them. But that would mean a huge scale-up of testing and contact tracing, at a time when even nursing homes still can’t get enough test kits, and public health agencies are swamped.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Nursing homes in the state could run out of masks, gloves and medical gowns in as soon as two weeks amid a nationwide shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a trade group leader said Friday. Marty Wright, CEO of the West Virginia Health Care Association, said the supply of personal protective equipment is dwindling as facilities rush to buy gear in a crowded marketplace marred by skyrocketing markups and delayed shipments. “What they’re seeing are shortages nationwide that are creeping into West Virginia,” Wright said. “The supply is not able to meet the demand.” He said he’s heard stories of masks that were less than $1 now going for $5, facilities being supplemented by homemade items, and nursing homes reaching out to overseas vendors as stateside suppliers are swamped.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican legislative leaders announced plans Friday to convene the state Assembly this week for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began in the state to pass a pandemic relief bill after removing key spending-cut provisions Democratic Gov. Tony Evers opposes. Assembly leaders notified members they they plan to call an extraordinary session beginning Tuesday morning. The session is expected to be conducted virtually, with several members physically present on the floor. It’s unclear when the Senate might convene. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald have been negotiating for days with Evers on a sweeping aid bill. The legislation is designed to supplement a federal stimulus package bringing about $2.3 billion to the state. The bill would eliminate the one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits, delay interest and late fees on property taxes, prohibit health insurers from discriminating against COVID-19 patients, and lift the minimum number of instructional hours for voucher school students, among other things.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Some state residents held a demonstration against government-mandated measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. About 20 people turned out in a park in Casper on Thursday to protest what they believe is government overreach. One demonstrator held a sign demanding Gov. Mark Gordon let the state work. Other signs read “Defend liberty” and “Don’t flatten the economy.” Gordon has ordered schools and a variety of businesses, from bars to movie theaters, to close and has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people at a time. Police watched the protest but didn’t intervene. Gordon has resisted calls for a statewide stay-at-home order but has urged people to stay at home except for essential work and activities. Cathy Ide with the Natrona County Campaign for Liberty, a libertarian group, told the Casper Star-Tribune the group organized the demonstration because so many businesses were closed. “You drive through Casper, it’s like a ghost town compared to what we usually are,” she said. “You don’t have the usual hustle and bustle, and it’s just sad.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/28/pachyderm-vacation-rental-cookie-monster-overdoses-stolen-baby-jesus-statue-found-news-around-states/111376276/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Two legislative committees approved a bill Wednesday that would ban gender therapies for minors such as prescription hormones or gender reassignment surgery. Rep. Wes Allen of Troy and Sen. Shay Shelnutt of Trussville are the sponsors of the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Allen said last week that children who struggle with their gender identity should receive mental health counseling and not medications or surgeries that cause physical changes. The Alabama House Health Committee approved Allen’s bill Wednesday morning, news outlets reported. Later, the Senate Health Committee approved Shelnutt’s bill in a 10-1 vote. Both bills will move on to the full House and Senate for consideration, respectively. Under the legislation, doctors would be charged with a felony for prescribing puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19. Surgeries on minors would also be prohibited. The bill also states teachers, principals and school counselors would be charged with a misdemeanor if they don’t tell parents their child identifies as transgender. This is the second bill in Alabama targeting transgender issues. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit public schools from allowing transgender students to participate on sports team that do not match the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state approved a regulation change establishing a personal-use salmon dipnet fishery on a portion of the Susitna River. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted last week to create the fishery that will be available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays between July 10 and July 31, The Anchorage Daily News reported. The Susitna system empties into Cook Inlet and is home to all five species of Pacific salmon. Dipnetters will be able to harvest up to 25 salmon in the new fishery in Southcentral Alaska, though chinook salmon will be off limits. Several groups backed the new fishery, including the Matanuska Valley Fish and Game Advisory Committee and the South Central Alaska Dipnetters Association, which both submitted proposals to the board. Personal-use fisheries are only open to Alaska residents and allow permit holders to harvest up to 25 salmon per head of household each year, with an additional 10 salmon for each additional family member. Personal-use salmon fisheries exist in Cook Inlet on the Kenai River, Kasilof River on the Kenai Peninsula and Fish Creek. There is also a personal-use fishery at the Copper River, which empties into Prince William Sound southeast of Anchorage. The proposal submitted by the Matanuska Valley committee said the new fishery would give area residents an opportunity to harvest salmon closer to home.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Early risers in several Western states reported seeing what appeared to be a meteor streaking across the sky before dawn. The American Meteor Society received multiple reports from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah about the fireball. “This does appear to be a bright meteor as observations are spread out from Southern California, southern Utah, and Arizona,” observer Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society told KNXV-TV. The phenomenon was captured on video by meteorite hunter Robert Ward in Prescott, Arizona, and posted on the organization’s website. It was also captured by a video camera mounted on Phoenix City Hall. “This is the best time of the month to view meteor activity as the moon will not be a factor at all,” the American Meteor Society said in their Meteor Activity Outlook for the week, noting the moon’s current phase.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State regulators have dismissed one violation and sustained two others against a medical marijuana dispensary in Hot Springs. The Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board voted Wednesday to sustain two violations against Green Springs Medical dispensary. The Hot Springs dispensary is the state’s most successful since opening May 1, selling more than 1400 pounds of medical marijuana as of Feb. 14, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The next closest dispensary, the Releaf Center in Bentonville, sold just more than 670 pounds in the same time period. Green Springs Medical had been charged with a series of rule violations, including inadequate labeling and improper signs. The board also decided Wednesday to reduce the facility’s fine from $7,025 to $1,000, noting that the dispensary’s owner has been cooperative with investigators and put in an effort to comply with regulations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco:A winter with little precipitation has left most of California abnormally dry and officials are bracing for the possibility of an early and more intense wildfire season amid record-breaking temperatures. Drought has expanded to nearly a quarter of the state, mainly in central California, the heart of the state’s agricultural sector, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map mad public Thursday. The map shows 70% of the state is abnormally dry. February is shaping up to be driest on record for much of the state, with chances of light showers on the horizon on March 1 and then not again until March 10. Sierra Littlefield, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, said there is a strong chance the state’s capital will see a completely dry February – something that has never happened. Downtown San Francisco is on its way to its first rain-free February since 1864, said meteorologist Anna Schneider. The dry beginning of the year comes after a wet 2019 that capped mountains with snow, delivering water to reservoirs and helping to boost lush vegetation that can quickly turn into fuel for wildfires during dry, windy conditions. About 75% of California’s annual precipitation typically occurs from December through February, mostly from atmospheric rivers – long plumes of moisture originating far out in the Pacific Ocean. State officials were scheduled Thursday to conduct a survey of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about 30% of California’s water. The first reading of the winter there, on Jan. 2, found a snowpack that was 97% of the January average. But that had changed by the end of a largely dry January when the amount of water in the snowpack dropped to 72% of the Jan. 30 average, state water officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nVail: An avalanche took the lives of two people who had turned back to avoid a dangerous area, a report said. The Feb. 15 avalanche north of Vail killed Dillon Block and Cesar Almanza Hernandez, The Vail Daily reported Tuesday. Block, Hernandez and a companion who was not identified were riding in the back country on low-angle slopes and in meadows and were avoiding steeper slopes, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report said. They were operating snowbikes, which are off-road motorcycles modified for use in the snow. After riding into a creek bottom in the afternoon, the riders entered an open area and turned around to head back. An avalanche started and the third rider was able to ride into nearby trees, but Hernandez and Block were buried in the slide, the report said. Volunteers worked to free Block and Hernandez until responders with Vail Mountain Rescue Group arrived at the scene around 9 p.m. “Given the time elapsed, darkness, increasing snowfall, and no easy way to evaluate the avalanche danger above the site, the group left and returned to the Red Sandstone trailhead,” the report said. A Vail Mountain Rescue Group team returned the next morning to recover the bodies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: A man who got into a fight while leaving his son’s hockey game last month has asked for leniency. Matthey Zolin, 51, made a brief appearance before a judge at a Stamford courthouse where his attorney applied to a diversionary program for first-time offenders that will result in his charges being expunged, the Greenwich Time reported Wednesday. The Greenwich resident was arrested on Jan. 31, along with another father, after the two began fighting while exiting a game where their sons played against each other. Both men were charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and interfering with police. Officials said the altercation became physical after one of the two said something denigrating about the abilities of the other’s son. Prosecutors have made no objection to Zolin’s application to enter the diversionary program. If he is granted acceptance and successfully completes the program, the charges against him will be expunged and his criminal record will remain clean.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Two more wells near a military base have elevated levels of chemical contaminants, according to state environmental officials. Delaware’s environmental protection department was recently notified by officials at Dover Air Force Base that the wells near the base might have levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, above federal advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion. The notifications come after high levels of PFOS and PFOA were found in four other wells near the base last summer. One of those wells had a PFOS level of 168,000 parts per trillion and a PFOA level of 2,460 parts per trillion, according to a document provided to The Associated Press. The Air Force is continuing to provide alternative water supply to those properties. The owners of the more recently tested wells, which provide water to a single commercial business, also are being provided bottled water. Officials said Tuesday that samples taken at 10 other wells indicated PFOS and PFOA levels below the EPA’s health advisory level. PFOA and PFOS are among a class of man-made compounds known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics, food packaging and, notably, firefighting foam that has been used at military bases across the country.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A landlord facing ongoing lawsuits with the district’s attorney general has been arrested for failing to pay for repairs, according to court documents. The documents said Mehrdad Valibeigi with the Bennington Corporation has been charged with contempt of court and is being held in the D.C. jail after Valibeigi failed to make a payment required by the judge’s order. A spokesperson for Attorney General Karl Racine said his office first filed a complaint against Valibeigi in October 2018 for allegedly collecting rent, but failing to maintain his apartment buildings and make necessary repairs. The AG requested a Receiver for the 35 units that comprise the Bennington Apartments, located at 4480 C Street, 4459 Benning Road SE and 4569 Benning Road SE in Ward 7. Court documents showed Racine also asked for restitution for those tenants, as well as penalties for the owner. Tenants quoted in the initial complaint said nails were coming out of their ceilings, roaches had consistently been a problem for decades and mice found their way into apartments through multiple holes in the walls and sinks. Documents state Valibeigi was supposed to deposit $25,000 into an account for the Receiver to fund repairs by November. He paid $5,000, but still has not paid the rest, according to the documents. The judge said in the most recent January hearing that if Valibeigi did not fulfill the court’s order to pay the remaining $20,000 by Feb. 24, he would be arrested. Racine’s office said Valibeigi failed to comply and was taken into custody on Monday, where documents stated he will be held until he has paid the outstanding amount. Court documents showed that a status hearing is scheduled for Feb. 28.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The government of the United Arab Emirates has granted a $3.5 million gift to help kick off a major coral reef restoration program in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The grant, announced Wednesday by officials of United Way of Collier and the Keys, is the first funding commitment of the $100 million Mission: Iconic Reefs program announced last December by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its Keys sanctuary. The program, to be funded by public and private resources, calls for restoring seven iconic coral reef sites off the Keys consisting of nearly 3 million square feet of the Florida Reef Tract, about the size of 52 football fields. The effort is likely to take two decades and is to be accomplished in two phases, Sanctuary officials said. Since the 1970s, tropical cyclones, heat-induced coral bleaching, cold snaps and disease events have reduced coral coverage in the Keys. Over the past 15 years, pioneering restoration efforts involving growing and transplanting corals have proved successful in the Keys, setting the stage for the large-scale restoration effort. Running from Key Largo to Key West, the Sanctuary includes Carysfort Reef, Horseshoe Reef, Cheeca Rocks, Sombrero Reef, Newfound Harbor, Looe Key Reef and Eastern Dry Rocks. The $3.5 million coral restoration gift is part of a $10 million pledge from the UAE to communities in Florida for recovery activities following Hurricane Irma. The United Way helped to secure the UAE financial gift for the Keys coral reef project.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJuliette: Officials in a Monroe County said they will pay to test water wells for coal ash contamination. County Manager Jim Hedges told WGXA-TV that the county will pay $10,000 to test about 55 private wells across the county. The tests come after environmental group Altamaha Riverkeeper tested wells of residents around Juliette and found chemicals they said indicate contamination from the coal ash pond at Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer. Georgia Power, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., said its own testing of wells around the coal-fired power plant showed no contamination above federal or state limits. The company plans to extract water from the coal ash, cap the pond in place and monitor it for future contamination. Juliette residents came to the state Capitol Monday to lobby for a bill that would require Georgia Power to dig up the coal ash and bury it in a lined landfill. Hedges said the results should come back within 7 to 10 days. Residents are also lobbying to be connected to a water system, but county officials said that could cost $20 million and take two years to complete. Beyond the county testing, Duke University Professor Avner Vengosh, who studies coal ash contamination, is scheduled to visit Monroe County to study 10 to 12 private wells within 2 miles of Plant Scherer. The county will pay travel costs for Vengosh and a student.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. military authorized the transport of World War II aircraft on government ships and planes for use in the 75th anniversary commemoration of the end of the war, officials said. Up to 24 privately owned aircraft will be transported to Oahu for the events between Aug. 29 and Sept. 2, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The transport of the vintage planes will be conducted by Air Force cargo planes or ships including an aircraft carrier or other flattop vessel, officials said. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a Jan. 27 memo that he wants a coordinated effort for a “lift of opportunity” to bring the planes to the commemoration. “As we approach the 75th anniversary of V-J Day (Victory over Japan) on Sept. 2, 2020, I am encouraging all services to seek opportunities to honor this important milestone,” Esper said. Elissa Lines, executive director of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum, said 19 aircraft owners have applied to participate. The aircraft include a B-25 Mitchell bomber, A-26 Invader, SBD Dauntless dive bomber, P-40 Warhawk, TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, P-51 Mustang, F4F Wildcat, C-47 transport, PBY Catalina, F-8 Bearcat, and T-6 Texan, she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Roughly a month after one of Idaho’s newest Fish and Game commissioners had to step down because of his political affiliation, a panel of lawmakers has approved a bill to remove the commission’s bipartisan membership requirements. The commissioners set hunting and fishing regulations, seasons and other wildlife policy. They’re appointed by the governor, and Republicans have held a majority on the commission for years. The remaining spots sometimes go to commissioners who are unaffiliated, rather than Democrats. The bill, which would end the current rule that no more than four members of the seven-member commission be from the same political party, was approved by the House Resources and Conservation Committee on Tuesday, The Times-News reported. Idaho Wildlife Federation executive director Brian Brooks opposed the bill, noting the commission was created by the state’s first voter initiative in 1938, which specifically called for a bipartisan approach to prevent undue political influence on resource issues. He said politicization is one of the biggest concerns for Idaho hunters. It passed 14-4, and now heads to the full House. Former commissioner Bradley Melton was appointed in September but stepped down in January after it was revealed that he had changed his political affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated shortly before he applied for the post. At the time, Gov. Brad Little thanked Melton for his candor and service, and said the next appointment would be made “in accordance with the spirit of the law.” Rep. Paul Shepherd, a Republican from Riggins – the same region that Melton represented on the commission – said Tuesday that the best candidates for the job shouldn’t be disqualified because of their party affiliation. Rep. Fred Wood, who previously served on the commission, said appointments are made based on experience with and views on the environment, and party affiliation doesn’t factor in.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A program that honors women veterans and their service wants to send those in Illinois to Washington, where they will tour war monuments for a day and be celebrated for their service upon their return home. Operation HerStory is seeking 100 women that served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and periods in between 1940 to 1975 to participate in the Honor Flight. The program has partnered with organizations, including Honor Flight Chicago, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing veterans with honor and closure. It will be the first all female Honor Flight in the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The trip was announced at the Pritzker Military Museum and Library on Tuesday. John Ptak, president of Honor Flight Chicago, said that although the nonprofit has brought more than 8,700 veterans to Washington, fewer than 200 of the participants have been women. Almost 40 have signed up already, said Ginny Narsete, the founder of Operation HerStory and a retired master sergeant in the Air Force. The flight departs the morning of Oct. 7, returning later that day. The women will tour the Women In Military Service for America Memorial and the Vietnam Women’s Memorial. Narsete said she doesn’t know what’s next for the program after the trip, but she hopes it will help the veterans to accept the honor and recognition they deserve.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The City-County Council forged ahead with its new tenant rights initiative on Monday night despite recent legislative effort at the Statehouse to undercut the effort, which seeks to protect residents from retaliatory landlords and educate tenants about rental rights. The first part of the proposal, which passed with an 18-5 vote, appropriates $250,000 to establish a tenant information hotline and provide legal assistance for renters in need. The council’s five Republicans voted against it. The second proposal strengthened protections for renters, requiring landlords to notify tenants of their rights and responsibilities and fining landlords who retaliate against tenants. That proposal passed 19-4, with Republican Michael Paul-Hart crossing party lines to vote in support. But the initiative might be partially moot if the state legislature approves new language added to a bill earlier on Monday, drawing scorn from Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office and Democratic councilors. The amendment to Senate Bill 340 prevents cities from regulating landlord-tenant relations without approval by the General Assembly. It would nullify the requirement to notify tenants of their rights and would also eliminate the fines for retaliation. The move came after concern from the Indiana Apartment Association and other groups, once again highlighting the contrast between a heavily Democratic state capital in a largely Republican state. Yet the public voiced strong support for the council’s efforts on Monday night to combat an issue they highlighted as a crisis.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City:A mother has complained to the local school board after she said her sixth-grade daughter suffered a broken arm and elbow at the hands of two classmates carrying out a viral online prank. The woman said Monday night during a school board meeting that her daughter had been injured on Feb. 7, when two West Middle School classmates cajoled her into a jumping contest, then kicked the girl’s feet out from under her midjump, causing her to fall on her shoulder, the Sioux City Journal reported. Called the “skull breaker challenge,” the prank was made popular on the social media platform TikTok and has led to reports of children across the country suffering serious head and other injuries. The woman complained that a physical education teacher who was in charge was distracted by his cellphone when the incident happened and that school officials didn’t report the incident to the girl’s parents or seek immediate medical care. “She has no motion in her fingers, no motion in her wrist,” the mother said. “She may never play volleyball again.” School board members did not respond to the complaint during the meeting. Sioux City Community Schools Superintendent Paul Gausman did not immediately return a message left Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A mother is suing a suburban Kansas City school after a teacher was caught on surveillance video last year kicking her daughter, who was in kindergarten. The woman filed the lawsuit last month against the Shawnee Mission School District and the case was moved to federal court this week, the Kansas City Star reported. She contended that the district was negligent in its hiring, training and supervision of the first-year teacher, Crystal Smith, who was fired after the abuse came to light. The mother, who is identified only by her initials in the lawsuit, said her daughter got upset last February because she found some of her artwork crumpled on the floor at the Bluejacket-Flint Elementary School in Shawnee, and that her daughter approached the school librarian to show her the damage. When her daughter crawled into a bookshelf, Smith “yanked her out” and pinned her arms behind her back, causing her pain. Smith then asked the librarian to contact the principal for help, and when the librarian’s back was turned, Smith kicked the girl while she was lying on the floor, according to the suit. The mother said she learned about what happened when she picked up her daughter after school, and that she then confronted the teacher, who told her the girl wasn’t being truthful. She said she then spoke with the principal and requested that school surveillance video be reviewed. She says she received a letter from the principal nearly a week after the incident that said the teacher had admitted grabbing and kicking the girl. The girl’s mother says that if her daughter hadn’t told her what happened, it might never have come to light and her daughter could have suffered “more abuse at the hands” of the teacher. Her lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. A district spokesman said the school system doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky House voted Wednesday to create a tax on vaping products and increase taxes on snuff and chewing tobacco. The bill passed the House on a 75-17 vote and now goes to the Senate, media outlets reported. It’s estimated to raise $50 million of new tax revenue over the next two fiscal years. It aims to reduce vaping and smokeless tobacco use in a state with one of the nation’s highest cancer rates. The bill would add vaping products to the list of smokable tobacco products such as cigars that are subject to a wholesale tax, with that rate increasing under the measure. The legislation also doubles the per-unit tax on nonsmokable and chewable tobacco products, but does not affect the tax rate on packs of cigarettes. An organization representing 400 vape shop owners recently told legislators the bill would hurt their small businesses and discourage adults from vaping as a way to quit smoking cigarettes. The bill’s supporters, including organizations like the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, said the price increase on e-cigarettes will help curb the increased use of highly addictive vaping products by youth in the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Ronnie Anderson, the longest serving Farm Bureau state president in America, will retire this summer after 31 years of leading the largest agriculture network in Louisiana. Anderson won an astounding 31 straight elections before deciding he won’t seek reelection during the annual Louisiana Farm Bureau Convention in June. “It’s the right time for me,” Anderson said. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has been a powerful political force under Anderson, which elevated its influence in agriculture advocacy. Anderson has also served on the LSU Board of Supervisors in all but two years since former Gov. Mike Foster appointed him in 1997, hiring presidents and football coaches. He has engaged with governors, members of Congress and American presidents in his role as state president and as a member of the American Farm Bureau board in shaping agriculture policy. Anderson’s former first assistant, Jim Monroe, said Anderson has been able to maintain the confidence and support of Farm Bureau members for so long because of his ability to connect with them in a way the members trust. Monroe retired last year after serving 30 years as assistant to the president, the highest-ranking full-time staff position within the Farm Bureau Federation. The president serves as a full-time volunteer. Monroe was succeeded by Kyle McCann. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has grown from about 67,000 members in 1989 to more than 148,000 under Anderson’s watch. Anderson, 71, grew up on a dairy farm in East Feliciana Parish and returned to join the family business after graduating from LSU.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The rate of newborns in Maine who experience health problems because they’re exposed to opioids in the womb is nearly five times the national average, according to a report released by the state health department. Maine’s incidence of the health problems was a little more than 33 per 1,000 live births in 2018, according to the report, provided to the Maine Legislature by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. The national rate was seven per 1,000 live births. The finding was one of many in the annual report from the Maine Maternal, Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Panel that spoke to health challenges for mothers and babies in the state. According to the report, the percentage of women who smoked during pregnancy in Maine was nearly 12%, almost twice the national average of 6.5%. Slightly more children were also born to women with diabetes, and the percent of births to women who were overweight or obese was also about 5 percentage points higher than the national average, the report stated. The high rate of babies exposed to opioids before birth is a function of the state’s crisis, Stephen Meister, president of the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Wednesday. The rates of smoking and obesity reflect longstanding challenges in Maine, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A statue of an infant Jesus stolen from St. Paul’s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church is again in the church’s possession after it was missing for nearly a year. “We were very grateful,” said Father Matthew D’Amario, who noted the statue was returned in mid-January “surprisingly undamaged.” D’Amario said the statue, part of the church’s Nativity scene, had been stolen once before ahead of his tenure at the church. That time, it was inexplicably recovered from the ocean near the Inlet. In the latest incident, church staff reported the statue missing on Jan. 4, 2019. Video footage showed it was stolen on Dec. 31, 2018, according to police. Police later identified 43-year-old Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, as a suspect. Coke’s trial, on fourth-degree burglary and theft, was set for Jan. 8 but was postponed. Patrol officers stopped Coke as he was driving to the Inlet parking lot because of erratic driving, according to police. During a search of his vehicle, the statue was found. Officers determined Coke was under the influence of a narcotic, found cocaine in his possession and arrested him on charges including drugs and possession of paraphernalia. Coke told officers that he was involved in the theft and that he intended to return the statue to either St. Paul’s or Ocean City police, according to OCPD. Coke is scheduled to appear in Ocean City District Court on April 17, where he will be tried for burglary and theft..\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A 17-year-old boy is responsible for recently spraying red paint all over Plymouth Rock and several other sites in the historic Massachusetts community, police said Thursday. The teen faces 11 felony counts of vandalism and one misdemeanor count of trespassing, Plymouth Police Chief Michael Botieri said in a statement. The suspect’s name was not released because he is a juvenile, but the chief did say he is a resident of the town, which this year is marking the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ arrival. The rock symbolizes the spot where the Mayflower Pilgrims disembarked in December 1620. The suspect was identified by detectives who reviewed hours of surveillance video from the area, the chief said. In addition to Plymouth Rock, the National Monument to the Forefathers and the Plymouth Maiden statue were found defaced on Feb. 17. Most of the places were defaced with the number and letter combination 508 MOF. Botieri told The Patriot Ledger the boy offered no explanation for what was written. The vandalism has since been cleaned up. The Feb. 17 vandalism is not connected to vandalism to the town’s 9/11 Memorial discovered last Sunday, the chief said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna:The former home of a man accused of murder and cannibalism sold at auction for more than $20,000 over the asking price. The home of Mark D. Latunski, located at 703 Tyrrell Road in Bennington Township, had four bidders come forward Feb. 26 in Shiawassee County Circuit Courthouse in Corunna to place offers on the house. Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Sergeant Douglas Chapman told MLive the highest bid came in at $101,733.28 – $21,001 over the minimum asking price. Property records showed the home has a market value of about $93,000 and was originally purchased in May 2001 for $80,000, according to MLive. The name of the highest bidder was not revealed because the deed is not yet registered, MLive reported. Latunski is facing murder charges for the alleged killing and cannibalizing of 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in Latunski’s basement around Christmas Eve. Bacon’s naked body was found hanging from the ceiling by his ankles on Dec. 28. acon’s reported roommate, Michelle Myers, told police he connected with Latunski on Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, and met up with him Dec. 24. He was officially reported missing Dec. 25 by his family after he did not show up to Christmas breakfast at his parents’ home. Latunski reportedly admitted to police he stabbed Bacon twice in the back of the neck before stringing him up and slicing his throat. He confessed he then castrated Bacon and took his testicles and cooked and ate them. Michigan’s Center for Forensic Psychiatry deemed Latunski incompetent for trial Feb. 24. He was found incompetent for trial Thursday by a judge. He was referred to the State of Michigan’s Forensic Center for treatment in the Saline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:The Sauk Rapids-Rice school board has decided to enter into negotiations with Thief River Falls public schools Superintendent Brad Bergstrom to become their superintendent in July. The board made the decision Wednesday night after the second of two daylong interviews with two finalists. Robbinsdale Area Schools Director of Community Education Kristine Wehrkamp toured the district Monday, and Bergstrom followed the same schedule on Wednesday. Following the interviews, the board unanimously decided to select Bergrstrom, citing his experience and collaborative approach to leadership. Both finalists answered similar questions, first at a public interview at the Sauk Rapids Government Center and then, after a break for dinner, at a special meeting of the school board. Board members had received feedback from students and staff members who had met with the finalists as they toured the district. Bergstrom is in his fourth year as superintendent at Thief River Falls. He was a director of human resources, a high school principal and an area learning center director in the Austin school district. Earlier in his career, he was a teacher and a dean of students in Fergus Falls and Birchdale. He also coached hockey. Bergstrom will start contract negotiations with the district, and, if approved, will start July 1. He will replace Aaron Sinclair, who announced his resignation in December.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford:The University of Mississippi has apologized to dozens of African Americans who were arrested in 1970 for protesting racial inequality on the mostly white campus where Confederate images were a deeply ingrained part of campus culture. “I am sorry it took us 50 years to do this,” Provost Noel Wilkin said Tuesday during a conference called “Black Power at Ole Miss: Remembrance, Reckoning, and Repair at Fifty Years.” The university also awarded a diploma to one of the people who was arrested. Linnie Liggins – now married and known as Linnie Liggins Willis – had completed her coursework before her arrest but the university at the time refused to give her the diploma she had earned. She has worked as executive director at Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority in Toledo, Ohio. On Feb. 24, 1970, 40 members of the Black Student Union presented a list of demands to the university’s chancellor, Porter L. Fortune Jr., The Daily Mississippian reported. They wanted the university to hire more black faculty members, begin a black studies program and eliminate Confederate imagery at a time when many white students still waved rebel flags at football games. Also in February 1970, a group of black students burned a Confederate flag and danced on tables in the cafeteria to the music of B.B. King. The next day, almost half of the black students at the university participated in a protest during a campus concert of Up With People, a international traveling group that sang upbeat songs, including at least one tune about racial inclusion. A photo published in the student newspaper at the time showed that some of the protesters stood on stage with their fists in the air – a symbol of the black power movement. During and after the concert, 89 people were arrested and sent to a local jail or to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. They were released the next day. Eight of the students were suspended from the university: Donald Ray Cole, John Donald, Theron Evans Jr., Paul D. Jackson, Linnie Liggins, Kenneth Mayfield, lva Ruth Peyton and Henriese Roberts. The arrests happened less than eight years after Ole Miss enrolled its first black student under a federal court order and with protection of U.S. marshals. Five of the eight suspended students returned to campus for the conference Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican lawmakers on Wednesday took steps to resurrect a Missouri voter photo identification law that was gutted by the state Supreme Court. The court last month permanently blocked a central provision of the 2016 law that required voters who lacked a photo ID to make a sworn statement in order to cast a regular, nonprovisional ballot. In response, Republicans are trying to pass a new voter ID bill that is similar to the 2016 law but doesn’t include the sworn statement provision that the judges found objectionable. House members on Wednesday gave initial approval to the measure, which would give voters only two options, instead of three: either show a photo ID to cast a regular ballot or else cast a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots would be counted if voters return to their polling places on the same day with a valid photo ID or if their signatures match the ones on file with election authorities. To cast provisional ballots, voters would need to sign sworn affidavits that include their birth dates, addresses and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and that swear the information is correct. Missouri is one of several states where Republican-led legislatures have passed voter photo ID laws touted as a means of preventing in-person voter fraud, which studies have shown is rare. Democrats generally oppose such laws, arguing that they are really meant to disenfranchise voter groups that tend to support their party, including the poor, elderly and disabled as well as transient college students and minorities who are less likely to have photo IDs.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:The Trump administration said Wednesday a resumption of coal sales from public lands that had been blocked under former President Barack Obama will result in a negligible increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Critics accused the administration of producing a flawed analysis of the federal coal program that ignores its broader impacts. A federal judge last year had faulted the administration for failing to consider potential damage to the environment when former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in 2017 lifted a moratorium on coal sales imposed by his predecessor. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana stopped short in his April 2019 ruling from halting coal sales but said the Department of Interior had to conduct an environmental review of its decision. The Trump administration review focused on potential emissions from only four coal leases in Utah and Oklahoma that were sold after the moratorium was lifted. That’s a small piece of a federal leasing program that accounts for about about 40% of U.S. coal production, primarily from Western states that also include Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. Burning that fuel accounts for about 11% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to previous studies. Interest in federal leases has slackened considerably over the past decade as many utilities switched to natural gas or renewables and demand for coal plummeted. In documents released Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged Zinke’s order had hastened the resumption of federal coal sales before a three-year review begun under Obama was complete. But they argued those sales would have resumed regardless. Companies have mined about 4 billion tons of coal from federal reserves in the past decade, contributing $10 billion to federal and state coffers through royalties and other payments.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The condition of two of the people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Omaha after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan has improved significantly, officials said Wednesday. Two of the 15 people being monitored at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were being cared for at the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit because of the severity of their symptoms. Health officials said Wednesday, those two people improved enough to be transferred to the National Quarantine Unit where the other 13 people are being treated. Two of the 15 have tested negative for the virus and could be released from quarantine March 2. The people who tested positive for COVID-19 will have to test negative for it twice before they can be released.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: There were more than 4.1 million passengers at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas last month, according to new numbers released by the airport Thursday. The airport reported that the number of arriving and departing passengers in January was a 6.6% increase over the same month in 2019. It’s the 11th moth in a row where more than 4 million people passed through the airport, and a record for January travel. Most of January’s passengers, or about 3.8 million, were flying on domestic trips. McCarran saw a 7% increase in arriving and departing passengers on domestic flights up from 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is ordering flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday in memory of an Air Force pilot from Hudson who recently was killed in Afghanistan. Capt. Ryan Phaneuf and another airman died Jan. 27 in a plane crash. Phaneuf, who was 30, was a 2007 graduate of Alvirne High School. Sununu will present the New Hampshire Medal of Honor to Phaneuf’s parents and wife at his memorial services on Saturday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate:Lucy the Elephant, a six-story National Historic Landmark in Margate, is being offered up for overnight stays March 17-19 on the house-sharing website Airbnb. The one-night stays for two people are being offered for $138 – a price that pays homage to the number of years Lucy has been around – and booking is set to begin March 5 on a first-come basis. The pachyderm-shaped dwelling has an entrance in her back legs that takes guests to a remodeled living quarters. But, Lucy’s caretakers said she doesn’t have running water, so Airbnb is placing a heated bathroom trailer with a shower, sink and toilet for guests on the site. The promotion with Airbnb and the Save Lucy Committee is designed to encourage more visitors to the shore and to the elephant, which is one of the oldest surviving roadside attractions in America. Airbnb will make a donation to help support the committee, which has restored the wooden landmark and maintains her for the more than 130,000 visitors she receives in a year. The listing said Lucy has been a home before, as well as a tavern in a previous life.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A grandfather’s effort to euthanize the family duck drew police after residents reported multiple shots fired. Santa Fe police initially confiscated a handgun from Lorenzo Pacheco, who had fired four shots at the bird, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. His granddaughter, Kaelyn Pacheco, said in a phone interview Wednesday that officers showed compassion toward the man after learning he had carried out the shooting in an act of mercy. Police arrived just before a burial for the bird was about to start. Kaelyn Pacheco said the duck, a family pet, had become paralyzed and couldn’t walk, and it also had an eye infection. A police report of the incident said Lorenzo Pacheco “felt bad and did not want to break the neck of the duck and thought using a firearm would be more humane.” He placed the duck in an enclosed area and fired four shots, the report said. Officers went to Lorenzo Pacheco’s home, where he showed them the pistol he had used to shoot the duck. According to the report, the officer “collected the weapon for safekeeping and placed it into safekeeping.” Lorenzo Pacheco said in an interview that police returned his gun to him Tuesday after determining there was no cause for a charge of negligent use of a firearm.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Drivers who get five camera-issued red light tickets or 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a 12-month period will have to take a traffic safety course or risk losing their vehicles under a bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday. The law will take effect on Feb. 26, 2021 and will apply to tickets incurred after Oct. 26 of this year. The vehicles of drivers who exceed the ticket limit can be impounded unless the drivers take a safe driving course overseen by the city Department of Transportation. City officials estimated that the new law will affect about 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles, a fraction of the nearly 2 million vehicles registered in the city. The mayor and City Council will decide after three years whether to renew the law. De Blasio, a Democrat has sought to reduce traffic fatalities through measures such as lowering speed limits and adding speed cameras. But at least 20 pedestrians have been killed by motor vehicles on city streets this year, including a 10-year-old girl who was struck by a school bus on Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship. The North Carolina High School Athletic Association said on its website that junior Heaven Fitch of Uwharrie Charter became the first female to win one of the association’s individual state wrestling championships. She won the 106-pound weight class in the 1A division on Saturday. A photo released on the association’s official Twitter account showed her beaming, standing next to three boys who finished behind her in the tournament. She had a 54-4 record for the season and won Most Outstanding Wrestler for the 1A division. Fitch beat Robbinsville’s Luke Wilson to win an eight-person bracket that included seven male wrestlers, said James Alverson, assistant commissioner for the high school association. Overall, she was one of three female wrestlers in the tournament, he said. Last year, she became the first female wrestler to place, coming in fourth in her division.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The risk of spring flooding in the Red River Valley has been reduced slightly because of limited precipitation in the last few weeks, although National Weather Service forecasters said Thursday there’s still a lot of moisture in the system. The latest outlook showed a 50% chance that the Red River in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area will reach just under 35 feet, or 17 feet above flood stage. That could lead to some road and bridge closures, but most structures would not be threatened. There’s a 5% chance the river could top 39 feet, down 5% from the last report. Fargo city leaders said earlier this week they would fill 250,000 sandbags in case that happens. The weather service said precipitation totals since Sept. 1 remain at record highs in many areas along the Red River and the snowpack is at or above normal and could lead to a high runoff. However, the forecast no longer indicates a cooler and wetter late winter and early spring period. Conditions could change quickly depending on the rate of thaw and spring rains, the report said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Transgender females would be banned from competing in Ohio high school and college girls and women’s sports under a bill introduced Wednesday by House Republicans. The legislation would apply to all public schools and colleges and any private schools or colleges that are members of a state or national athletic association. The bill prohibits biological males from competing in girls or women’s sports. It comes as three high school girl runners in Connecticut are suing to block a policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in girls sports. Currently in Ohio, transgender girls can participate in sports after they have completed a minimum of one year of hormone treatment related to gender transition, under Ohio High School Athletic Association rules. Alternatively, transgender girls can compete if they demonstrate to OHSAA officials “by way of sound medical evidence” that they don’t possess physical advantages over girls of the same age. Similar bills have been introduced in Alabama, Arizona, Idaho and Mississippi. The Ohio bill sponsors are Rep. Jena Powell, of Arcanum in western Ohio, and Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus of Paris Township in northeastern Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman:Dozens of University of Oklahoma students staged a sit-in for a second day Thursday outside OU’s administrative offices following two instances of professors using racial slurs in the classroom. OU’s Black Emergency Response Team, known as BERT, gathered Wednesday morning in Evans Hall and called for the resignation of OU provost Kyle Harper, mandatory equity training for faculty, semester-long diversity training and a new multicultural center on campus. Some students spent the night in Evans Hall and the group said it would remain there “until these demands are met.” The sit-in comes days after interim OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. announced that a history professor read from a historical document in class that used the N-word repeatedly. Earlier this month, an OU journalism professor stepped down from teaching the course for the rest of the semester after telling students during class that the N-word is no more offensive than the term “boomer.” The university said in a statement late Wednesday that leaders had met with the students to discuss their concerns. “We identified areas of agreement that will move our university forward,” the OU statement said. “We have agreed to continue these discussions. We will also advance these conversations with other student, faculty, and staff leadership.”\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: A body found in Newport Bay has been identified as that of a fisherman who has been missing for nearly three weeks, the Newport Police Department said Thursday. Norman Grant was reported missing on Feb. 9 and hadn’t been seen since the evening of Feb. 8, Chief Jason Malloy said in a statement. Cellphone records and video from local surveillance cameras put Grant’s last known location near a fishing boat that he worked on called the F/V Prolifik. The boat was moored at Hallmark Fisheries. Grant’s body was discovered about 80 feet south of the Hallmark Fisheries dock when another boat ran into something under the water on Feb. 26. A subsequent inspection of the boat found clothing entangled in the vessel’s prop and a diver was called in. No cause of death or other details about the case have been released.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Newton: A mother wearing a Cookie Monster costume apparently overdosed on heroin while sitting in her running car, shortly after she had dropped off her 9-year-old son at a babysitter’s home. Rachel Love Martin, 38, of Westmoreland County was charged Wednesday with child endangerment. It’s not known if she has retained an attorney. The babysitter called police to her home because she was concerned Martin might have been under the influence of drugs, authorities said. Police found Martin slumped over the steering wheel of her car, and emergency responders soon gave her Narcan, a drug used to revive people suffering from a drug overdose. Meanwhile, police found Martin’s son wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks when he was dropped off, just a pair of pants and a T-shirt at a time when temperatures were in the low 40s, authorities said. It’s not clear why Martin was wearing the Cookie Monster costume, authorities said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Firefighters are sharing nearly $500,000 in retroactive payments to end the last outstanding grievance stemming from recent contract negotiations. A panel of arbitrators ruled that the city should retroactively pay firefighters an extra 2.25% for work performed during the budget year that ended June 30, The Providence Journal reported. The decision will cost the city $478,456, according to Mayor Joseph J. Solomon. The firefighters union negotiated a new three-year agreement in January, partially retroactive, for the period from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2022. That agreement had not resolved the firefighters’ wages for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The union had previously sought a 4% raise for wages during that period, and later it sought 3%, according to Solomon. Solomon had hoped to settle the matter by giving the firefighters 1.5% but he said the arbitrators’ decision is “fair and reasonable.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A law banning sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual – unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases – is fueling a climate of state-sanctioned discrimination, a federal lawsuit said. The National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal said the lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks to overturn the Comprehensive Health Education Act of 1988 as an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The law, which mandates how sex education classes are taught, also subjects students to bullying and violence and stigmatizes a group that’s already at a heightened risk of suicide, the lawsuit contends. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, named as a defendant in the lawsuit, agreed that the law is on shaky ground. She requested an opinion on its constitutionality from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson. That opinion said “a court would likely conclude” that the law violates the equal protection clause requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Parents can have their children opted out of the school sex education curriculum, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a proposal to start four schools based around Native American language and culture.The House will next consider the proposal, which aims to address high drop-out rates in some Native American communities in the state. The schools would teach an Oceti Sakowin curriculum centered on Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota language and culture. It is pushed by a group of educators who are planning to open the schools in Native American communities. When Sen. Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, introduced the bill, he had hefty opposition from Gov. Kristi Noem and education groups. But he was able to win the Republican governor’s support through a rewrite of the bill. He also won the support of the Republican-dominated Senate. Education groups oppose the proposal, saying that the current school system can accommodate innovative programs. The schools were originally called charter schools in the bill, but the term was switched to “community-based schools.” The schools would need to apply to school districts to start within the district, and they would receive funding based on the number of students enrolled in the schools. They would purchase or lease school facilities independently from the school districts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Meharry Medical College and health care provider Remote Area Medical are offering free dental care at an event this week. They will provide free cleanings, fillings, extractions and dental X-rays on Saturday on Meharry’s campus in Nashville during Oral Health Day. Services will be provided to up to 600 uninsured or underinsured middle Tennessee residents, according to a news release from the school. There will also be free kidney screenings provided by the Tennessee Kidney Foundation, the release said. Remote Area Medical is a nonprofit provider of mobile medical clinics that delivers free dental, vision and medical care to people in need. To receive treatment, patients must be at least 18 years old. They will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Services are free, and no insurance or identification is required. Check-in is at Henry A. Moses Ph.D. Alumni Hall on Meharry’s campus. Tickets will be distributed beginning at 6 a.m. Services will be available at 7 a.m. No children will be permitted. Care will be provided by Meharry dental students, Meharry School of Dentistry alumni and volunteer dental students and providers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Emergency crews rescued stranded drivers from the roofs of their vehicles on Thursday after a water main broke and flooded a Houston freeway. The flooding submerged vehicles on an eastern section of Loop 610, a highway that circles the city. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted early Thursday afternoon that all occupants were out of flooded vehicles. There were no reports of injuries. Drivers in the low-lying city are used to navigating flooded roadways during storms, but the water main-caused flash flood caught many by surprise on a sunny day. The fire department said on Twitter that it had rescued three people and searched and cleared 12 vehicles. Houston officials said the 8-foot water main burst as a contractor doing exploratory work for a city water line project moved soil from the line. The city said contractors are in the area to isolate the break and make repairs. City officials said they had received reports about low water pressure across a large swath of the city but that once the valves are closed, pressure should be restored. Gonzalez said some nearby businesses were reporting that they had no water service.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Leaders of a new Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee vowed Wednesday to be transparent and frugal as they design a plan based around existing venues and experience from hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics but that will also include new, modern ideas. The committee held its first meeting as it sets out to assess whether Salt Lake City should bid for the 2030 or 2034 Winter Olympics. There’s no timeline for that decision. Committee chair Cindy Crane told board members that every conversation they have about the Olympics should be considered public as the part of a completely open process. Crane, a former CEO of a major utility company, said after the meeting that the remark was made to establish ground rules and was not a direct reference to a bribery scandal that nearly derailed the plans for the 2002 Winter Olympics hosted by Salt Lake City. But, she said, “The strength of our operating principles are to make it very, very clear that those days are well behind us and not in our path forward.” The bribery scandal broke in 1998, three years after Salt Lake City was chosen over cities in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Salt Lake’s bid committee doled out $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors to International Olympic Committee members and their families. That included ski trips, NBA tickets, plastic surgery, knee replacements, violins and housing and salary for children of IOC members, according to report by an ethics panel. It led to the expulsion of six IOC members, the resignation of four others and severe warnings for several others, though none faced criminal charges. U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against two Salt Lake bid leaders, but both men were acquitted by a judge halfway through a federal trial.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier:The state House advanced a bill to tax and regulate marijuana sales in the state, after the Senate passed legislation last spring. Current Vermont law that went into effect in 2018 allows for the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, but it does not include a mechanism to tax and sell marijuana. The House vote on the tax-and-regulate legislation late Wednesday was approved 90-54. Rep. John Gannon, a Democrat from Wilmington, called Vermont’s existing law “awkward” because it legalized recreational pot but did not create “safe and legal access to it.” He told lawmakers that the question before them was whether cannabis, which was already legalized in Vermont, should be regulated. A House amendment has proposed a 14% excise tax on retail sales of marijuana products and a 6% sales and use tax for a total rate of 20%. The bill establishes a license for current medical dispensaries to start selling marijuana in February 2022. Other retailers would need to apply for licenses and could start selling it in July 2022. Cultivators, wholesalers and product manufacturers would need to apply for other licenses available. The program for licensed cannabis establishments would be administered by an independent Cannabis Control Board within the executive branch, which would be responsible for establishing rules, compliance and enforcement. The use of cannabis in public places would be prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he was concerned about highway safety, and said he wanted to see an effective way to test for impairment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An animal control company said it removed an 8-foot-long beehive from someone’s apartment. Virginia Wildlife Management and Control said in a statement that it removed the hive from the ceiling of a living room in Richmond on Monday. The space was in between tenants at the time. The company said the hive produced about 80 to 100 pounds of honey, although only about 15 to 20 pounds was able to be salvaged. Rich Perry, owner of the wildlife control company, told The Charlotte Observer that the hive was large enough to support 100,000 to 150,000 bees. But he said it wasn’t fully occupied Perry said it was extremely unusual to find such a large hive inside a building. He said the hive of Italian bees was likely to be at least 2 years old. He said the bees probably got in through holes in the siding and found a home between rafters and sheet rock.The company said it has a “no kill” policy with bees. But he said the company could not find the queen after an extensive search and that the hive could not be saved.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A measure prohibiting homicide defendants from claiming as a defense that panic brought on by a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity has been passed by state lawmakers. Nine states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have legislatively banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington measure, passed by the Senate on a bipartisan 46-3 vote Wednesday, is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reported. Kuhnhausen, 17, disappeared in early June and her remains were discovered Dec. 7, southeast of Battle Ground. A Vancouver man has been charged with second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington. Authorities said Kuhnhausen was strangled after her assailant learned she was transgender. He has pleaded not guilty. There was no immediate indication if he will attempt to use a “panic” defense. The bill, which passed the House earlier this month on a 90-5 vote, would block a defendant from using a defense based on discovery or disclosure of the victim’s actual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation and would prevent a claim of “diminished capacity” because the defendant did not fully comprehend the nature and gravity of the alleged crime. The legislation now goes to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Investigators are seeking help from the public as they try to determine the cause of separate fires on the same day at adjacent businesses in southern West Virginia. A medical building under renovation and a gun shop were destroyed in the Feb. 10 fires in Williamson, the state fire marshal’s office said in a news release Thursday. Although firefighters battled a fire at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, crews discovered the gun shop had been broken into and items had been removed. The second fire at the gun shop occurred about four hours later with flames shooting through the roof, the statement said. The state fire marshal’s office is working with Williamson police in the investigation. Although the statement said it’s not known how the fires started, it said a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The number of abortions performed in Wisconsin increased for a second straight year in 2018 after eight years of declines, the latest report from the state Department of Health Services showed. Abortions increased 7% in 2018 over 2017, the report said. There were 6,042 abortions in Wisconsin in 2018, up from 5,640 the year before. That’s nearly double the rate of increase between 2016 and 2017 when abortions went up 3.7%. The growth is due to there being 539 more medication abortions in 2018 compared with 2017. Planned Parenthood opened a clinic in Sheboygan in May 2018 that offered medication abortions. The latest report showed that women ages 20 to 24 had 30% of the abortions in 2018, the most of any age group. The total number of abortions had dropped steadily from 2009 until 2017. Anti-abortion groups Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life both decried the increase. Republicans who control the Legislature passed a number of bills restricting abortion access in recent years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last year vetoed for Republican-backed bills designed to limit the number of abortions.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Federal investigators want help from the public as they try to find out who poisoned a golden eagle and ravens in southwest Wyoming four years ago. They’re offering a reward of up to $2,000 for information leading to a conviction. The golden eagle and four ravens were found dead southwest of Wamsutter in 2016. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday investigators also found poison-laced baits in the remote area of interspersed private and U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. Investigators said the case is unrelated to the 2018 poisoning deaths of three dogs, a bald eagle and dozens of other birds in the Dubois area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and Wyoming Game and Fish Department are offering rewards up to $7,000 in that case. Golden eagles are federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. A person who kills one illegally can get up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/29/nursing-home-isolation-oahu-weddings-eligibility-rolls-news-around-states/115649840/", "title": "Nursing home isolation, Oahu weddings: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s top health official said Friday that a study showed about 30% of adults in Alabama are hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine, a reluctance that concerns medical officials as they try to keep case numbers on the decline. The Department of Public Health released the results of the survey done to gauge vaccine hesitancy and figure out how to craft messaging to reach reluctant groups. “There is around 30% of people who indicate they are not interested in being vaccinated,” State Health Officer Scott Harris told reporters. He said the hesitancy cuts across racial lines. He said the reasons vary from being staunchly against vaccinations to just having questions. Alabama on March 22 expanded eligibility for COVID-19 vaccinations to include more front-line workers; people 55 and older; those with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and residents ages 16 to 64 with certain high-risk medical conditions. Alabama does not have an estimate of when it will open eligibility to all adults, but the state expects to beat the May 1 deadline set by President Joe Biden, Harris said. “This script is going to flip completely, you know, from a month ago when people couldn’t find vaccine – it seems like no matter how hard they look – to in April, we’re going to have the opposite problem,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had 22,300 fewer jobs last month than it did in February 2020, the state labor department reported Friday, citing an ongoing economic toll from the COVID-19 pandemic. The biggest losses were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had 7,300 fewer jobs last month than a year prior, a department jobs report showed. Oil and gas had 3,900 fewer jobs, and the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector had 1,800 fewer jobs. The report showed 2,000 fewer local government jobs last month compared to February 2020, with losses primarily tied to K-12 education. There were 200 more jobs in state government compared to February 2020, which the report said is largely due to pandemic-related hires for work such as contact tracing and processing unemployment insurance claims. The department said job losses remain “historically large,” with unemployment claims during the second week of last month nearly four times higher than the same week a year earlier.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey’s administration said Friday that it will allow a federally supported vaccination site in the Tucson area, begrudgingly reversing course while blasting Pima County’s management of coronavirus testing and COVID-19 vaccinations. Ducey’s top health official, Dr. Cara Christ, said she’ll let the county work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on vaccines, but only if the county can prove it won’t need state help and if FEMA commits that it won’t reduce the supply of vaccines flowing through her agency, among other conditions. In a blistering letter, Christ accused FEMA staff of being so disrespectful to local and state workers that some needed counseling. And she questioned whether Pima County is capable of managing a vaccination site financially or logistically. Arizona’s second-largest county had been pushing the state to approve an offer from FEMA to establish a community vaccination center to serve its Hispanic population. In a news conference Friday, Christ defended Ducey’s decision to lift remaining restrictions on large gatherings and businesses and to prohibit local governments from requiring masks – a decision criticized by the state’s major hospitals. Christ said there could be an uptick in infections, but with most older people vaccinated, hospitals are unlikely to become overcrowded.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday signed into law legislation allowing doctors to refuse to treat someone because of religious or moral objections, a move opponents have said will give providers broad powers to turn away LGBTQ patients and others. The measure says health care workers and institutions have the right to not participate in nonemergency treatments that violate their conscience. The new law won’t take effect until late this summer. Opponents of the law, including the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union, have said it will allow doctors to refuse to offer a host of services for LGBTQ patients. The state Chamber of Commerce also opposed the measure, saying it sends the wrong message about the state. Hutchinson opposed a similar measure in 2017 that failed before a House committee. But he said the law he signed was narrower and limits the objections to particular health care services. “I support this right of conscience so long as emergency care is exempted and conscience objection cannot be used to deny general health service to any class of people,” Hutchinson said in a statement. Opponents have said types of health care that could be cut off include maintaining hormone treatments for transgender patients needing inpatient care for an infection, or grief counseling for a same-sex couple.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to stop operating two mass vaccination sites next month, just days before the state makes everyone 16 and older eligible for a shot. The sites in Oakland and Los Angeles opened in February for an eight-week pilot program that concludes April 11. The sites will switch from the Pfizer to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires just one shot, during the final two weeks of operation so people don’t have to sign up for a second dose elsewhere. State and county officials said they would have liked the program to continue, though it provided a small fraction of California’s overall shots. Each site was set up to vaccinate 6,000 people per day, but they have been administering up to 7,500 shots per day, according to the state Office of Emergency Services. Because the sites are federally managed, those shots are separate from California’s overall weekly allocation, now about 1.8 million a week. The two sites combined have administered half a million doses, with about 67% going to underserved communities and people of color, according to OES. Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the agency, said the state is working with Los Angeles and Alameda counties to see if they can continue to put the sites to use. The state asked for an extension of the program, but it has not been granted.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Eight billionaires in the state have acquired $9.7 billion in new wealth over the past year despite the coronavirus pandemic. Charlie Ergen, the co-founder of Dish Network and EchoStar Corporation, gained the most between March 18, 2020 and March 18, 2021, The Denver Post reports. Forbes data revealed Ergen was worth $5.4 billion last March and is now worth $10.7 billion, a 98% gain that made him the state’s wealthiest person. Ken Tuchman, founder of the Englewood-based outsourcing giant TTEC Holdings Inc., had the largest percentage increase of the state’s billionaires from $1.3 billion in March 2020 to $3.1 billion last week, according to Forbes data. Liberty Media Corporation Chairman John Malone gained $2.3 billion over the past year and is now worth $8.1 billion. Pat Stryker, the medical technology heiress and the state’s richest woman, took in $900 million and is now worth $2.9 billion. Media heir Gary Magness gained $500 million and is worth $1.6 billion. The Denver Post reports messages left with the billionaires’ spokespeople seeking comment were not returned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Workers will go door to door in 10 cities starting this spring, urging residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Hartford-based Grossman Solutions will oversee the $2.9 million outreach effort under an agreement with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration announced Friday. “The door-to-door canvassing program will focus on knocking on doors in areas of need and getting residents scheduled for vaccination appointments,” Lamont’s office said in a press release. The program also will promote mobile and pop-up clinics and “work to assist residents in hosting virtual house parties with their friends and neighbors to help ensure residents have the facts about the COVID-19 vaccine and can share their experiences,” the governor’s office said. The Connecticut Department of Public Health also announced a $5.3 million plan to expand call center services for the state’s Vaccine Appointment Assist Line. Access Health CT, a quasi-public state agency, will amend a contract with Faneuil, Inc. to target communities high on the social vulnerability index. The door-to-door program will prioritize Black and Latino neighborhoods in Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Hartford, Waterbury, Norwalk, Danbury, New Britain, Bristol and Meriden, according to job postings on Grossman Solutions’ website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Many of the ZIP codes with the highest percentage of white residents – also the oldest, richest and most highly educated – have the largest percentages of fully vaccinated Delawareans. Meanwhile, those with the lowest vaccination rates are often home to people whose median income and education levels are lower than the state average. An analysis found a larger portion of these residents live in poverty. When looking at the race data available for each ZIP code, the information contained significant holes. Officials say this is in the process of being fixed. Census race data offered the chance to see at a bird’s-eye view how the ZIP codes compared. As of now, it is not possible to know the racial breakdown of who is receiving the vaccine in a particular ZIP code. Still, the overarching narrative is clear: Lewes and Greenville, areas with residents who are mostly white and older, have the highest percentage of people fully vaccinated, with more than a quarter having received shots. ZIP codes with a higher percentage of people of color are lagging. Georgetown, once the center of a COVID-19 hot spot, has vaccinated 9% of its residents. Downtown and south Wilmington, one of the poorest areas in Delaware, has just 6% of its residents fully vaccinated. The ZIP code with the lowest vaccination rate is University of Delaware’s campus. Most young adults have not yet been eligible for the vaccine.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As vaccine disparities persist, with many Black and Brown communities falling behind, leaders are working to bring doses directly to the people who need them most, WUSA-TV reports. Charles Allen, D.C. councilmember for Ward 6, worked with Howard University Hospital, Mount Moriah Baptist Church and Serve Your City/Ward 6 Mutual Aid to set up a mobile vaccination clinic at the church Friday morning. Lucius Dalton, senior pastor at Mount Moriah, said many of the 180 people who got their Johnson & Johnson shots at the clinic said they had not been planning on getting vaccinated. Offering doses at the church changed their minds. “The church, especially the African American church, has always been a place of trust, of hope, and I think that when persons see that it is happening at a church, they feel a sense of security,” Dalton said. “They feel as if everything is going to be alright simply because they’re coming to a church.” Vaccination data from D.C. Health shows neighborhood disparities in vaccine administration. “It’s going to take this type of intentional, direct neighborhood-focused outreach to make sure we can reach folks,” Allen said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Businesses, governments and health care providers will be protected from coronavirus lawsuits if they made a good effort to follow guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, under a bill the House sent to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday. In order for a lawsuit to move ahead, a plaintiff would have to show that the defendant deliberately ignored guidelines. A plaintiff would also need a signed affidavit from a doctor stating with reasonable certainty that injury or death caused by COVID-19 was a result of the defendant’s actions. The bill “provides limited liability protection to those entities in Florida that tried day after day to do what they were told they needed to do,” Republican Rep. Colleen Burton said. Democrats said the measure will deny access to the courts for people who were damaged by the disease or whose relatives died from the coronavirus. They said the language in the bill and need to prove gross negligence will make it difficult to bring a case forward.Republicans argued that in the early days of the pandemic, there were changing theories on how the virus spread and what protocols should be taken to prevent it. They also said there were shortages of supplies like masks and other personal protective equipment. The issue is a priority for DeSantis, who is expected to sign the bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWaycross: The governor received a COVID-19 shot Friday in southeast Georgia. Gov. Brian Kemp got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine at the Ware County Health Department in Waycross, his office said in a news release. He was joined by his youngest daughter, Amy Porter. “We are both feeling great and are so thankful for the medical miracle that is literally saving countless lives here in Georgia and around the world,” Kemp said in the release. “We encourage every Georgian to join us and help our state get back to normal.” Georgia on Thursday opened up access to COVID-19 vaccines to everyone over 16. The governor traveled to the the southeastern part of the state to reinforce that vaccines are safe and effective, his office said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Weddings on Oahu can now be held outside with a maximum of 100 people after an easing of public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said Friday that the loosened restrictions would be effective immediately. Weddings were previously restricted to 10 people. A limit of 10 people will continue for indoor weddings. For outdoor weddings, a maximum of 100 people will be allowed, seating will be limited to 10 people per table, everyone will be required to wear masks, and each wedding must be supervised by “event planning professionals.” Temperature checks will also be required. The news was applauded by members of the state’s wedding industry, which was dramatically affected by the pandemic. “This is a significant and incredibly important step to revitalizing our industry,” Oahu Wedding Association President Joseph Esser said in a statement. “While our industry has a long road to recovery, we are beyond thankful to Mayor Blangiardi for his swift action to reopen weddings over the past few weeks.” Dancing will be allowed, as long as dancers wear masks and follow social distancing mandates of two dancers for every 36 square feet, with a maximum of 32 dancers.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: A former county commissioner candidate and a couple have filed a lawsuit against the city and multiple civic leaders and police officers alleging their First Amendment rights were violated after they were arrested on accusations of not following coronavirus safety measures last fall at a church singing event in the City Hall parking lot. Gabriel Rench, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Latah County Commissioner in November, and Sean and Rachel Bohnet filed the lawsuit Wednesday in federal court, The Lewiston Tribune reports. The lawsuit alleges Moscow police officers’ “reckless indifference” to their rights resulted in their arrest and detainment. “This is a lawsuit in order to make reparations for their wrongful arrests and the fact that they were humiliatingly prosecuted for criminal activity when there was no violation of the law,” said Michael Jacques, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. Police cited Rench, the Bohnets and two others for suspicion of violating the city’s public health emergency order at the event Sept. 23. Moscow Mayor Bill Lambert issued the order requiring face coverings in public when physical distancing could not be maintained with people not in the same household. Jacques said the singing event was held to protest the order.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Public health officials on Friday approved universal COVID-19 vaccination in areas where demand for the shots is lagging and pledged to dispatch mobile teams to boost vaccine distribution in one trouble spot as the disease’s toll started to creep back up. And while other states are dumping mask mandates, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the Illinois public health director, reemphasized the need for face coverings and other well-known precautions such as social distancing, despite increasing supplies of vaccine. The single-day total of confirmed and probable cases of the illness topped 3,000 Friday for the first time in seven weeks. Hospitalizations because of the virus jumped by 15% in the prior five days. The seven-day test positivity rate crawled up to 3.2% after hitting a post-October low of 2.5% on March 11. “We don’t want to go down the same path we’ve seen before and experience a resurgence in the pandemic, which is why Gov. Pritzker directed us to use all our resources to halt these upticks,” Ezike said in a statement. Those include mobile rapid-response teams that will be dispatched to five counties – Boone, Carroll, Lee, Ogle and Whiteside – in northwest Illinois. Those areas have witnessed a week’s worth of increased hospital bed usage and test positivity.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Another 20 residents have died from COVID-19, pushing the state’s pandemic toll to more than 13,000 deaths over the past year, state health officials said Friday. The Indiana Department of Health also reported that another 1,136 Hoosiers have tested positive for the coronavirus, boosting the state’s known case total since the pandemic began to 682,099. State heath officials announced Thursday that more than 1 million Indiana residents had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with state’s health commissioner Dr. Kris Box calling the accomplishment “an exciting milestone.” The health department said Friday that a total of 1,561,705 first doses of vaccine have been administered across Indiana, and 1,042,768 Hoosiers – more than 15% of Indiana’s population – have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Residents age 40 and older, along with health care workers, long-term care residents, first responders, are currently eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Educators up to grade 12, along with other school workers such as classroom aides and bus drivers, are also eligible.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Coronavirus data continued to suggest Friday that activity is increasing in the state, with virus infections and deaths rising further. Similar trends were noted Friday by White House COVID-19 Response Team members who expressed concerns about rising cases. “We have seen cases and hospital admission move from historic decline to stagnation to increases, and we know from prior surges that if we don’t control things now, there is a real potential for the epidemic curve to soar again,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Please take this moment very seriously.” Iowa reported 979 new cases Friday and 19 additional deaths, increasing the state’s death total to 5,708. The seven-day positivity rate increased to 4.8%. The state has 207 people hospitalized after having dropped below 200 in late February. There were 46 COVID-19 patients in intensive care. Walensky advised people to continue wearing masks and practicing other safety measures to reduce virus transmission. Iowa has delivered nearly 1.37 million doses of vaccine, and nearly 525,000 people, or 16.8% of the population, have been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly announced Friday that anyone 16 or older will be allowed to get a COVID-19 vaccine starting Monday because the state expects to get enough of the medicine to speed up its inoculation process for the second time in two weeks. Kelly’s announcement means Kansas will enter the fifth and final phase of its vaccine distribution. The move to make vaccines available to another 400,000 people comes after weeks of criticism from Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature that the effort is not moving quickly enough or organized well enough. Democratic President Joe Biden on Thursday doubled his goal for shots during his first 100 days in office to 200 million. “With the anticipated increase in supply from the federal government, we must get every dose of vaccine into arms quickly,” Kelly said in a news release. “I strongly encourage every Kansan to get the COVID-19 vaccine so we can get back to school, back to work, and back to normal.” Dennis Kriesel, executive director of the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments, said some county health officials have asked state officials about refusing vaccine shipments for the next week or two. He said some were struggling to get people on their vaccine lists, even with last week’s expansion of eligibility.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear has proposed nearly $700 million in direct aid to small businesses and low-income Kentuckians as part of a multilayered plan he presented to lawmakers for spending about $2.4 billion in federal pandemic aid being funneled to the state. The Democratic governor has been negotiating with leaders of the Republican-dominated Legislature on how to use the massive infusion. Kentucky’s leaders face a tight timeline to reach an agreement in this year’s legislative session, with lawmakers set to reconvene Monday for the last two days of work. Meanwhile, Beshear issued a series of line-item vetoes Friday to budget bills passed by lawmakers. One vetoed provision would restrict him from spending the federal relief money without the Legislature’s approval. Republicans hold supermajorities in both legislative chambers and are poised to take up override votes on Beshear’s vetoes this week. Beshear has called the federal assistance a “once-in-a-generational opportunity” to improve lives. His plan for spending the federal money reflects a mix of direct aid to individuals and businesses along with long-term investments in water and sewer projects, broadband and school construction.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s historically Black college system on Friday launched a statewide vaccination campaign trying to encourage minority residents to get COVID-19 shots. The Southern University System said it created the “Don’t Wait. Vaccinate!” campaign because communities of color are disproportionately affected by the disease but getting vaccinated at lower rates than white people. “As the only historically Black university system in the country, located right here in Louisiana, it is our obligation to ensure that African Americans and other ethnic minorities are well informed about the dangers of COVID-19 and the significance of getting vaccinated,” Southern System President Ray Belton said in a statement. Southern’s campaign comes as Gov. John Bel Edwards has expanded vaccine eligibility to anyone age 16 and older. The outreach effort will include social media promotion, public events and advertising. Southern’s Baton Rouge campus held a drive-thru vaccination event Saturday with Ochsner Health, and a mass vaccination event across nine locations including all Southern campuses will be held April 10. University leaders are enlisting alumni, faith-based associations and social organizations to encourage people to get vaccinated.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s combined commercial fishing industries managed to top $500 million in value last year despite challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s fisheries were valued at about $516.8 million at the docks last year, the Maine Department of Marine Resources said Wednesday. That was the ninth-highest value in the history of the state, the department said. The state’s lobster fishery anchored the total at about $406 million. State marine resources commissioner Patrick Keliher said lobster dealers developed new markets in the face of a market collapse caused by the pandemic. Lobstermen also adjusted their fishing effort to the market, and the industry’s adjustments “resulted in a good boat price during a year with seemingly insurmountable obstacles,” he said. The second-highest-valued marine species in the state was the softshell clam, which was valued at about $15.7 million. Clams were followed by scallops at about $6.8 million. Other valuable fisheries included menhaden, a fish which is used as bait for lobster, and oysters, which are grown by aquaculture businesses.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state is extending its health insurance special enrollment period until the middle of August. Gov. Larry Hogan and the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange announced Friday that uninsured state residents will have the chance to enroll in health coverage until Aug. 15. This deadline aligns with the federal special enrollment period extension announced by President Joe Biden for those 35 states that use HealthCare.gov, the federally run health insurance marketplace. Hogan said his administration remains committed to ensuring Marylanders have access to the resources they need to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the state, 144,000 people have enrolled in the coronavirus special enrollment period since its beginning last March. The number includes both private health plans and Medicaid.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The number of cities and towns across the state that are at high risk for COVID-19 transmission has more than doubled in the past two weeks, to 32 this past week from a low of 14, prompting public health officials to warn of another surge. “We are already seeing a little surge,” Worcester Medical Director Dr. Michael Hirsh said Thursday, the Boston Herald reports. He warned that the return of students who went on spring break to states where coronavirus variants are more prevalent, along with the upcoming Passover and Easter holidays, could be “a setup for even a bigger surge.” The number of high-risk communities had fallen to 14 after peaking at 229 in January. Many of the new cases are in people under age 30, Gov. Charlie Baker said. “While these residents are far less likely to be hospitalized, it remains critically important for all residents, particularly young people, to continue to practice prevention strategies and not let down their guard,” the Republican governor said. There were more than 2,300 newly confirmed cases Friday, while the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Massachusetts rose by 40. That pushed the state’s confirmed COVID-19 death toll to 16,771 since the start of the pandemic, while its confirmed caseload rose to more than 588,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday again vetoed about $652 million in proposed pandemic relief spending after the Legislature passed it without negotiating with her administration. Majority Republicans reapproved the funding following the Democratic governor’s first veto weeks ago during a fight over an attempt to link federal funds to her agreeing to cede certain pandemic powers solely to local health departments. One bill proposed $405 million in state-funded business relief and a $150 million deposit into the unemployment insurance fund. Another would have given $87 million in federal funds to private schools and $10 million to reimburse parents for summer school expenses. In a letter to lawmakers, Whitmer said she vetoed the measures because they primarily included spending she previously rejected. “I remain ready and willing to negotiate regarding the allocation of the more than $2 billion in federal money now sitting idle in the Michigan treasury,” she wrote. “That’s money that could be immediately put to work supporting our kids, families, and small business.” GOP legislators had urged the governor to approve the spending because it was not tied to bills that would have required her to get legislative approval to extend state coronavirus restrictions.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Friday announced a final expansion in vaccine eligibility to all residents 16 and older starting this week, though securing an appointment may prove difficult for much of the state. The expansion, which will go into effect Tuesday, comes before an anticipated increase in the state’s weekly allotment that will amount to about 424,000 doses delivered to Minnesota in early April, according to Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm. Walz acknowledged that demand will outpace supply before the increased shipments from the federal government arrive but urged the newly eligible Minnesotans to get in line. The governor set a goal for the state to be the first in the country to reach the milestone of 80% of its population fully vaccinated. “We want to keep the queue loaded so that we go for that goal we need to get to – 80% or above of our population vaccinated – to get that immunity that we need to truly turn back to all of the things we love so much,” Walz said. Malcolm said the state’s current vaccine infrastructure – which includes health care providers, pharmacies and local public health agencies – has the capacity to administer 500,000 doses every week. State-sponsored vaccination sites, community pop-up sites and employers willing to do vaccinations at workplaces can further augment that capacity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A little more than a year after the Mississippi State Department of Health reported the state’s first coronavirus-related death, the state has now reached 7,000 deaths. The department reported two more deaths Saturday, bringing the total to 7,000 since the virus hit the state. The number of people who have died due to complications from COVID-19 in Mississippi would completely fill the seats of the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson. “We don’t know where it’s (going to) stop,” State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said during a briefing this month as the toll was just approaching 7,000. “Most of those people didn’t have to die.” The state’s vaccination efforts have continued to grow, and it appears weekly COVID-19 deaths have decreased. Yet, as new cases of the different variants are identified and reported, with two tracing to California noted in Mississippi last week, Dobbs has been urging residents to continue to be diligent in taking precautions. “Get vaccinated. Now,” Dobbs said during Friday’s weekly roundtable discussion. “That’s going to be the thing that makes all the difference.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Jackson County is the state’s latest jurisdiction to ease COVID-19 protocols as the numbers of new cases, deaths and hospitalizations continue to drop. County Executive Frank White Jr. said Friday that as of April 9, all businesses can open at full capacity. That includes gyms, fitness centers and recreation centers. White said restaurants and bars also can operate at full capacity and serve food and alcohol. Masks will be required when patrons aren’t consuming food or drinks, and social distancing is still required. The county also is dropping capacity limits, but the mask mandate and social distancing protocols remain in effect. “If we remain diligent in our prevention efforts, we will be one step closer to getting back some normalcy in our daily lives,” White said. Also Friday, Gov. Mike Parson signed an executive order extending the state of emergency through Aug. 31. The extension gives the state flexibility in distributing resources and eases regulations during pandemic recovery efforts. It also allows for continued use of the Missouri National Guard and federal funding for response efforts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: As lawmakers decide how to allocate millions of dollars in American Rescue Plan Act money, some Republicans are looking at ways to reduce the federal stimulus funds awarded to local governments, Native American tribes and schools that have stricter COVID-19 guidelines than the state. A “significant portion” of Republican lawmakers “are concerned that part of the challenge will be a resistance to open up the economy fast enough,” Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said Friday. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Frank Garner, R-Kalispell, requested an amendment to reduce funding to local governments with stricter directives by 20%. “It’ll put some pressure if some area holds out,” Jones said of the amendment. The reduction would apply to infrastructure grants and other funds allocated by the Legislature, he said. State law allows counties and cities to have stricter health guidelines, and several have continued to require face coverings after Gov. Greg Gianforte lifted the statewide mask mandate Feb. 12. Tribes have also had stricter guidelines, and some school districts have enacted mask requirements. The proposal to allocate the money will continue to be discussed by the House Appropriations Committee on Monday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Douglas County could start giving vaccinations to residents who are at least 16 years old by mid-April, catching up with parts of rural Nebraska that have already moved onto that phase. The Douglas County Public Health District lists the timeline on its website, and local public health officials say it seems realistic. Other public health districts have started vaccinating younger residents, including the Public Health Solutions Health Department, which represents Filmore, Gage, Jefferson, Saline and Thayer counties in southeastern Nebraska. Health officials in the district said they’re vaccinating residents who are at least 18. The Two Rivers Public Health Department, which represents seven counties including Buffalo, Dawson and Kearney, is now vaccinating those 16 and up. All districts in Nebraska are vaccinating residents 50 and older. Previous phases have focused on residents who are older than 65, those in the health care industry, and people in certain professions such as first responders and educators. Rural areas have generally vaccinated residents faster than in the Omaha and Lincoln areas, partly because their populations are smaller. Statewide, health officials have vaccinated 19.8% of residents who are at least 16 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State health officials reported 445 new coronavirus cases Friday, reflecting a minor uptick from the average over the past two weeks, along with 11 new deaths. Recently, the state has reported far fewer cases and deaths than it did at the peak of a surge several months ago. Still, officials are monitoring whether relaxed prevention measures that accompanied the decline could be leading to another surge in cases. Photographs from a casino in Las Vegas showed swarms of people crowding its pool, prompting Gaming Control Board Chairman J. Brin Gibson to notify resorts that their pools remain subject to a 50% capacity cap. The statewide directives are “clear that variants of the COVID-19 virus do exist, and medical experts have determined that several of these variants are significantly more contagious than the original virus,” he said. Nevada has fully vaccinated more than 437,000 residents, or roughly 14% of the population. The state plans to open up vaccine appointments to people 16 and older April 5, but officials have repeatedly said availability depends on supplies provided by the federal government. Nevada Health Bureau Chief Candice McDaniel said health officials were confident they could manage the challenges expected to accompany the eligibility expansion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has urged residents to exercise patience as the state’s COVID-19 vaccine appointment website opens up to people 40 and older Monday. The Republican warned Sunday that during high-volume times in the morning, people may have to wait to book appointments through the Vaccine and Immunization Network Interface. A new online waiting room feature will give VINI users an estimated wait time, he said. And people should only attempt to sign in using one device. “We have made upgrades to the system which will allow more than 1,000 people per minute to register with plenty of appointments for everyone,” Sununu said in a statement. The University of New Hampshire, meanwhile, is pushing back its commencement ceremonies from May 15 to May 23. University President James Dean said in a message Friday that the change allows the ceremony at Wildcat Stadium to be held on a weekend day, which graduates had requested. Dean said graduates need to register to attend and will have to submit a proof of a negative coronavirus test. No decision has been made yet on whether guests will be allowed to attend, he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will expand vaccine eligibility beginning April 5 to those 55 and older, as well as to people 16 and older if they have intellectual or developmental disabilities, Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday. The expansion to millions of residents and those who work in New Jersey means millions more people will be able to get a shot. It comes just as the state expects to see what Murphy has called a quantum leap in the number of vaccines it receives from the federal government. The newly eligible also include higher education teachers and staffers, along with communication support workers, including engineers and members of the media. Real estate, building and home service workers will also be permitted to get shots, along with sanitation workers and bank tellers, accountants and other financial industry employees. Laundry service workers, utility workers and librarians round out the 1C category that Murphy greenlighted Friday. Murphy, a Democrat, has set a goal of fully vaccinating 4.7 million people, or 70% of the adult population, by July. On Friday, he said the state would surpass the goal he set in December.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has received an initial vaccination shot as the state opens up eligibility to more residents. The 61-year-old governor and former congresswoman announced Friday in a news release that she received the shot of the Pfizer-manufactured vaccine at a clinic on a school campus in Santa Fe. The state is making shots available to residents 60 and older, essential workers, and a variety of health and hospice workers, among others. “I will keep wearing my mask and I will keep up the physical distancing to protect myself, my family and my neighbors,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. Nearly 1.1 million vaccine doses have been administered across the state of 2.1 million residents, according to its vaccine information dashboard. About one-quarter of New Mexico residents are fully vaccinated. Department of Health data also show that nearly half of residents from ages 60 to 74 have received at least one vaccine shot. Local rates of coronavirus positivity in testing and related deaths in New Mexico have plummeted in recent months.\n\nNew York\n\nHerkimer: Vaccines have begun saving lives in the state’s nursing homes, but they haven’t yet cured another crisis caused by the pandemic: loneliness. Persistently high rates of COVID-19 have left the majority of New York’s nursing homes off limits to visitors, despite relaxed guidance meant to help reopen them. Until last week, under state and federal rules, they could admit visitors only if they had no new infections among either patients or staff for 14 days. That mark proved too hard for most to reach. A little more than half of the state’s 616 nursing homes were ineligible for indoor visits in mid-March, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. That’s the highest percentage of any state. New York updated its visitation rules Thursday in a way that will now allow visits to resume under certain conditions, even if a resident or staffer has recently tested positive. But that relaxed standard might not clear the way for visitation in many homes having trouble keeping the virus out. Under the new guidelines, homes would still have to halt visits after any resident or staffer tested positive for the coronavirus, but they could potentially resume for some patients if a thorough round of further testing revealed the outbreak was confined to just one part of the facility.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s unemployment rate fell for the fifth consecutive month in February, the Commerce Department said Friday, as its economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 recession. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 5.7%, compared to 5.9% in January. The state unemployment rate spiked at 13.5% last spring as Gov. Roy Cooper and governors nationwide mandated severe business restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus. The U.S. rate in February was 6.2%. In February 2020, just before the pandemic took hold nationally, the state rate was under 4%. The number of employed workers last month rose by 4,800 compared to January, or to nearly 4.75 million, according to department data. The number of unemployed people dropped by more than 10,900 to about 286,800. Industry categories seeing the most month-over-month employment increases were in business and professional services as well as in trade, transportation and utilities, according to department figures.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Republican-led Legislature moved Friday to allow booze sales on Sunday mornings, marking further relaxation of what had been the nation’s toughest business restrictions on that day. The House voted 49-41 to allow alcohol sales seven days a week beginning at 8 a.m. Bars and restaurants can’t serve alcohol from 2 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sundays, while liquor stores can’t sell alcohol until noon. The Senate narrowly approved the measure last month. It now goes to GOP Gov. Doug Burgum. If signed, the change would take effect Aug. 1. North Dakota has had “blue laws” restricting business on Sundays since it became a state in 1889, stemming from fears that shopping on Sunday morning would compete with church. After many failed attempts over the years, the Legislature in 2019 repealed Sunday business restrictions but left in place the prohibition of early alcohol sales. The measure got a “do-not-pass” recommendation in the House Judiciary Committee. Rep. Robert Paulson, R-Minot, who carried the bill on the House floor, said the committee felt there was “plenty of time to buy alcohol in our state as it is now.” Supporters of the measure said it was unfair to single out alcohol sales now that most other Sunday shopping bans have been repealed.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine unsuccessfully pushed a last-minute compromise with fellow Republican lawmakers over a bill restricting the state’s ability to respond to public health emergencies like the pandemic, records show. The governor was open to giving lawmakers some oversight over public health orders. But he wanted more involvement from them when it came to overturning such orders, according to an email obtained by the Associated Press. DeWine also proposed putting representatives of the governor’s office at the table with lawmakers as they reviewed public health orders, according to the March 21 email from Dan McCarthy, DeWine’s legislative affairs director, to GOP Senate President Matt Huffman. “We hope they provide a solid foundation for a further conversation,” McCarthy told Huffman, referring to the governor’s proposals. The bill in question would allow state lawmakers, by a simple majority, to rescind public health orders issued by the governor or the state Health Department as soon as they take effect, as well as prevent the governor from reintroducing similar orders for at least 60 days. The bill would also limit state-of-emergency orders to a period of 90 days but allow lawmakers to extend them in 60-day increments indefinitely.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s epidemiologist is defending the health department’s change from daily to weekly reporting of coronavirus information. The daily reports did not provide a true picture of the virus, epidemiologist Jared Taylor said Friday. “Just quite simply that does not tell the true story of what’s happening in a community, what’s happening in the state, how we need to be perceiving things and how we need to be responding to things,” Taylor said. Weekly reports that began March 17 level out one-day changes, Taylor said. Public health officials have criticized the change, including Tulsa Health Director Bruce Dart, who has said his agency used the daily data in making virus response decisions. University of Oklahoma Health COVID Officer Dr. Dale Bratzler said he is not happy that county, city and ZIP code data are now not being reported. “We won’t be able to tell quite as well whether we see hot spots or outbreaks that happen in the state,” Bratzler said. “Perhaps the state health department will be able to do that, but we won’t be able to see it because it’s not transparent right now.” Taylor said if the state sees value in returning to a daily report, it will do so.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown said Friday that she will accelerate the state’s vaccine eligibility timeline by two weeks for those over age 16 with underlying medical conditions, front-line workers and those living in multigenerational homes. Those groups will now be eligible to sign up for COVID-19 vaccines April 5. Those over age 45 with underlying conditions become eligible for the vaccine Monday and are already eligible in 22 counties that have inoculated most of their older population. All Oregonians over 16 will become eligible no later than May 1, Brown said. She said the number of counties ahead of schedule on inoculating their population and increased vaccine supply from the federal government made it possible to speed up the timeline. Under current projections, Oregon will receive enough doses to inoculate all eligible residents by the end of May and will be able to deliver them all by early to mid-June, said Oregon Health Authority director Patrick Allen. Dr. Dean Sidelinger, state epidemiologist, said large public events such as the Olympic track and field trials scheduled for June in Eugene and the Pendleton Round-Up in September could likely go forward this year with COVID-19 safety precautions. State health officials are working on guidance for event organizers, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate was stable in February, with the labor force and payrolls both growing as they creep back toward pre-pandemic levels, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 7.3%, the same as in January, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. That was more than a whole point above the national rate of 6.2% in February. In a survey of households, the labor force grew by an estimated 35,000 in February, to back above 6.3 million. The number of employed accounted for most of that, rising by 30,000. The number of unemployed also grew slightly. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls in Pennsylvania expanded in February by almost 17,000, to above 5.65 million. Pennsylvania has regained about 60% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million last February, according to state figures. Leisure and hospitality grew the most of any sector, by almost 13,000 jobs to 439,000. The hard-hit sector remains down about 25% from pre-pandemic levels after losing an estimated 60% of its jobs last spring. Restaurants and bars remain under stricter pandemic rules than other businesses.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state’s congressional delegation is highlighting the important role community health centers will play in getting more vaccines to people in underserved communities that have been hit hardest by COVID-19. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said he’ll join Reps. Jim Langevin and David Cicilline at the Comprehensive Community Action Program in Cranston on Monday. The Democrats will discuss more than $33 million in federal funds that community health centers in the state are set to receive to expand vaccine access, conduct outreach and support essential workers. The money comes from the nearly $2 trillion pandemic relief bill recently signed into law by President Joe Biden. The eight health centers receiving the money are located in Cranston, Pawtucket, Newport, Burrillville, Providence, Woonsocket, Johnston and Hopkinton. The congressional members will also be joined by Jim Vincent, executive director of the NAACP Providence Branch, and other community leaders.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has opened up COVID-19 vaccination to all residents 16 and older, saying Friday that they could begin scheduling appointments this week and receive shots starting Wednesday. State officials initially had planned to implement the 16-and-up rule in May, after completing a final priority phase for people 45 and older. “Our priority with the vaccine has been to save the lives of those at the greatest risk of dying,” McMaster said in a news release. “By staying the course and resisting distractions, we’ve expanded South Carolinians’ access and eligibility for vaccinations faster than originally anticipated.” As of last week, more than 1.1 million people in South Carolina, or about 27% of the total population, have gotten at least one vaccine dose, according to public health officials. Nearly 618,000, or about 15%, have been fully vaccinated. In January, the governor said he was frustrated by what he characterized as a slow vaccine rollout. The Republican governor credited former President Donald Trump’s administration with the vaccines’ speedy development but bemoaned “bottlenecks” that he said were hindering dissemination to those in the first priority group, including health care workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: Citing improving case numbers and vaccination rates, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has taken down the coronavirus checkpoints on its reservation that were a point of contention between the tribe and Republican Gov. Kristi Noem and the former Trump administration. Cheyenne River spokesman Remi Bald Eagle said the approximately 175 workers who staffed the nine checkpoints around the clock will be offered jobs helping with vaccination sites, contact tracing and quarantine support. The tribe also hopes to work with President Joe Biden’s new Bureau of Indian Affairs staff to maintain control over its police department, after the Trump administration sent a letter in December saying the agency would begin managing the department. The tribe filed a lawsuit alleging the BIA began to aggressively pursue a long-standing issue over tribal officers’ background checks in order to pressure it to shut down its checkpoints, the Rapid City Journal reports. The tribe established the checkpoints to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and barred some drivers from passing through or stopping on the reservation. Noem said the checkpoints on state and federal highways were illegal because they were interfering with interstate commerce.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Encouraged by improved COVID-19 case trends and increased vaccine availability, Rhodes College and Christian Brothers University are both planning for a more normal campus experience this fall. The schools’ presidents shared plans of fall returns with their campuses last week, both planning for a return of mostly in-person courses. In general, higher education institutions in Memphis have restricted campus density for most of the pandemic. “We are planning to be on campus this fall so you will be able to live and learn in person and experience the full range of campus life,” Marjorie Hass, president of Rhodes College, wrote to students. The college’s return will include some remote courses, but all Rhodes students, rather than just first-years, will be eligible to return to campus housing for the next academic year. CBU President Jack Shannon said the university’s hybrid courses will return to traditional in-person classes at traditional capacity. The university is simultaneously increasing its online course offerings, Shannon said. Faculty who are not comfortable returning are instructed to contact human resources. Both colleges join the University of Memphis in announcing expanded in-person campus density for the fall semester.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state is making COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone starting this week. Texas on Monday becomes the most populous state to expand eligibility to all adults. The state has nearly 30 million residents. Anyone 16 or 17 years old will also be able to get a vaccine starting Monday. But the Texas Department of State Health Services said only the Pfizer vaccine is authorized for individuals in that age group. Texas has one of the nation’s slowest vaccination rates. About 12% of the population had been fully vaccinated as of Saturday, and about 24% had received at least one dose, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. In comparison, neighboring New Mexico has fully vaccinated more than 21% of its population and given at least one dose to 36% of its residents. More than 10 million vaccinations have been administered in Texas, according to state health officials, and more than 1 million more doses are expected in the state this week, the health department said Saturday. More than 3.5 million Texans are fully vaccinated, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is on pace to remove all coronavirus-related restrictions by July if transmission rates keep dropping, but the situation could change, Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday. He urged residents to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to remain cautious. Cox made the announcement before he and his wife received their first dose at a COVID-19 vaccination center in Utah County, days after the state opened eligibility to everyone 16 and older. More than 450,000 of the state’s 3.2 million residents have been fully vaccinated, and over 814,000 have received at least one dose, according to state data. “Even if we do see an increase in cases, the fact that we have vaccinated so many of our most at-risk population makes us even less vulnerable to the outcomes,” Cox said at his weekly COVID-19 briefing. About 80% of people 65 and older have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Over half of that group have been fully vaccinated, said Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson. New coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Utah are expected to continue decreasing as the vaccine rollout continues, said State Epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department on Friday reported the largest one-day increase in the number of coronavirus cases since the pandemic began more than a year ago. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said half the 251 new cases reported Friday were in people under age 30 and only four in people 65 or over. Despite the increase in cases, the number of residents being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19 is continuing to decline, a testament to the vaccination program that has focused first on older adults, officials said. Levine cited a variety of factors for the increase in cases, including people moving around more with the arrival of warmer weather, virus fatigue and the continued spread of some of the more transmissible strains of the virus in Vermont. He noted that some countries in Europe are locking down again and said the world is still not safe from the virus. “The reality is we should always continue to be humbled by the virus,” Levine said during the state’s twice-weekly virus briefing. Despite the increases, Vermont is continuing its gradual reopening. Gov. Phil Scott said state officials plan to outline in the next 10 days how the virus-imposed restrictions will continue to be loosened.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Health officials have reported the first cases in the state of a highly contagious coronavirus variant that first emerged in California last summer. The discovery of the two California variants in Virginia means there have been a total of four variants found in the state, including strains first discovered in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Thursday that the California variants are associated with increased person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, but there is no evidence at this time that infections with the variants cause more severe disease. In total, state health officials have reported 176 cases of coronavirus variants in Virginia. The DPH said it is likely that additional cases with “variants of concern” will be identified. Health officials urged people to continue to comply with mitigation measures, including wearing face masks correctly, staying at least 6 feet away from others, avoiding crowds, washing hands often and getting vaccinated for COVID-19 when they become eligible.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The union representing 7,000 Seattle Public Schools employees has ratified an agreement to bring elementary students back into classrooms for in-person instruction April 5. The Seattle Times reports the agreement makes official a return to school buildings for the district amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Seattle is Washington’s largest public school district, with more than 50,000 students. The Seattle Education Association had 82% of members approve the deal last week. The parents of about 58% of SPS students indicated in a districtwide survey last week that they plan to return their children to school for hybrid instruction, a district spokesperson said. The district received responses from families of 14,272 of its 24,648 currently enrolled students. Under the agreement, elementary school students and secondary students with disabilities would return to buildings April 5 – Gov. Jay Inslee’s deadline for districts to offer in-person instruction for young students. Some elementary students receiving special education services would return March 29. Students would attend schools four days per week on half-day schedules for just under three hours, with some attending in the morning and others in the afternoon.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Up to a quarter of senior citizens who have preregistered for a COVID-19 vaccine through the state system have yet to book an appointment, the health secretary said Friday. About 22% to 25% of residents 65 and over don’t have a shot scheduled yet, said Bill Crouch, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources. But he said that “a lot of these individuals,” making up a total of 11,000 to 12,000, may have separately found an appointment through a local pharmacy or clinic. “We’re moving very quickly to get that list down,” Crouch said at the governor’s press conference. Republican Gov. Jim Justice has a goal of vaccinating 85% of senior citizens. He said last week that more than 70% are at least partially vaccinated. The state opened three new regional vaccine clinics in Kanawha, Berkeley and Monongalia counties for residents 65 and over, who are urged to call the state’s vaccine hotline at 1-833-734-0965 if they are still waiting for an appointment. “We will get you in that day if you call us,” Justice said. “And to be perfectly honest, we have the supply that we’re going to end up putting stuff on shelves if you don’t come and you don’t come in droves to get the vaccine.” The state expects another increase in doses from the federal government this week.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Friday vetoed a Republican-supported bill that would have required him to submit a plan within three weeks for returning state employees to work out of their offices during the pandemic. Evers said in his veto message that more state employees are scheduled to return to their offices starting April 5 and that the goal is to resume normal operations this summer. Evers said he was vetoing the bill because it encroaches on his authority as governor to administer and oversee employment policy. Republicans in the Legislature have been pushing for state employees to return to their offices as COVID-19 case counts drop in Wisconsin and vaccinations go up. Evers, in his veto message, also defended the work being done remotely by state employees, saying they have gone above and beyond to serve during the pandemic. “This work should not be discounted or demeaned,” Evers said. “These workers deserve our gratitude and respect.” In addition to pushing for state workers to return to the office, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos last week called on Wisconsin’s business community to “step up” and return workers to offices by the Fourth of July.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The number of deaths in the state rose significantly in 2020 over the previous year, and authorities say COVID-19 was a key factor in the increase. The Wyoming Department of Health documented 5,983 deaths last year, an increase of 862 deaths – or 16% – over 2019, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The coronavirus was a clear driver of the increase, implicated in the deaths of 528 Wyoming residents last year, state health authorities said. “Our data has shown steady, small increases in deaths for several years largely due to our state’s aging population,” said Guy Beaudoin, the Vital Statistics Services deputy state registrar with the health department. “But before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we never would have predicted the large jump we saw in 2020.” COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death among the state’s residents after heart disease and cancer. Ranking fourth was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, followed by various types of accidents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/29"}]}

No changes have been made to the scheduled time of the game, which is set for Saturday at 6:00 p.m. HT, or midnight Sunday on the east coast.\n\nIn fact, Hawai‘i director of media relations Derek Inouchi told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday that the Rainbow Warriors athletic department is working with Delaware State to adjust practice times, but that there have been no discussions about rescheduling the game itself.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Delaware State's travel issues ahead of its game against the Rainbow Warriors.\n\nDid Delaware State make it to Hawai‘i for Saturday's game?\n\nNot yet, but the Hornets are on their way. The Delaware News Journal (part of the USA TODAY Network) reported that the football traveling party left Wednesday morning and is expected to arrive in Honolulu Wednesday afternoon. Although the Hornets initially wanted to avoid connections, their trip Wednesday is now requiring three separate flights.\n\nHow did Delaware State miss its flight to Hawai‘i?\n\nBecause the trip to Honolulu, from Philadelphia or Baltimore, is nearly 5,000 miles, Delaware State preferred to take a direct flight. The closest options were from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, requiring shuttle buses. The company contracted to shuttle the Hornets contingent, Wertz Motor Coaches, said Tuesday in a statement to HBCU GameDay that it had \"an internal scheduling malfunction\" in its reservation system, which led to a delay in picking up the Delaware State traveling party.\n\nThe Hornets, therefore, missed their scheduled flight, and had to spend Tuesday night in a New York City hotel while it arranged alternate travel plans.\n\nAs the team garnered national news coverage for its travel issues, players appeared to take advantage and keep the mood light, posting videos to their social media accounts.\n\n\"It was unfortunate with the bus company, but that’s another matter,\" DSU president Tony Allen told The News Journal Wednesday.\n\n\"I can tell you these are resilient guys,\" Allen added. \"Things like this happen. They got it. I know they’ll be uber-focused on the game.\"\n\nHow much money is at stake in the Delaware State-Hawai‘i game?\n\nAccording to an athletic event agreement contract obtained by USA TODAY Sports, the University of Hawai‘i is obligated to pay Delaware State $180,000 to participate in the game. The agreement was signed by the presidents and athletic directors of both schools in late February and is fairly typical for Hawai‘i when it plays FCS programs to fill out its schedule. By comparison, a similar athletic event agreement contract also obtained by USA TODAY Sports shows that the University is obligated to pay Northern Iowa $165,000 for a game set to take place September 21 at 6:00 P.M. HT.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hawai‘i is required to pay Delaware State no later than 60 days following the completion of the game. The agreement also stipulates that Hawai‘i cover \"round trip airfare for a travel party of 100 not to exceed fourteen hundred dollars ($1,400) per fare,\" but also notes that \"all change fees shall be paid by Visiting Team.\" Hawai‘i also covers hotel lodging and transportation to and from the airport, hotel, practice facility and stadiums.\n\nThere is also language in the agreement that concerns cancellations, forfeitures or non-appearances. If either party were to commit a breach of contract, the offending party would be forced to pay the other program \"a liquidated sum of Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000).\" That sum represents the estimated attendance revenues for the game. \"The Parties further agree that the sum provided for herein is a reasonable estimate of the damages that would be incurred as a result of breach and is not a penalty,\" the agreement reads.\n\nThere is, however, protection in the agreement if a cancellation, forfeiture or non-appearance is caused by a \"Force Majeure Event,\" which includes extenuating circumstances like \"strikes, slowdowns, or labor disputes or troubles involving the Parties.\"\n\nWhat to know about Delaware State-Hawai‘i fooball game\n\nThe Hornets went 1-10 last season and finished dead last in the Mid-Eastern Atlantic Conference, losing all five of their conference games. Delaware State scored 18 points per game last season, which ranked the program 102nd out of a possible 122 FCS teams.\n\nThe Rainbow Warriors are coming off of a 5-8 campaign and an eighth place finish (3-5) in the Mountain West Conference. Hawai‘i quarterback Brayden Schager led the Mountain West in 2023 in passing yards (3,542) and passing touchdowns (26). The Rainbow Warriors have won their last 20 games against FCS opponents.\n\nHow to watch Delaware State-Hawai‘i football game\n\nFor local audiences, the game will be broadcast on Spectrum Sports pay-per-view. For those outside of Hawai‘i, the game can be streamed through the Team1 Sports app, by searching \"Hawai‘i football\" in the channels tab.\n\nThe game is scheduled to take place at the Clarence T.C. Ching Complex, on the University of Hawai‘i's campus.\n\nContributing: Steve Berkowitz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2024/08/20/delaware-state-football-misses-flight-hawaii/74875025007/", "title": "Delaware State football misses 11-hour flight for Hawaii game", "text": "Delaware State is set to open its 2024 season at Hawai'i this weekend, but the week is already off to a hectic start for the Hornets.\n\nThe team was scheduled to make its 10-and-a-half hour flight to the island of Oahu on Tuesday, but it missed its flight, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The team was scheduled to fly out of John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, but reportedly missed its cross-country flight due to an issue with buses.\n\n\"We’re working on a plan,\" a team spokesperson told the Star-Advertiser.\n\nThe specific issue surrounding the busses transporting the team was not announced. It is roughly a 178-mile − or more than three hour − drive from the Delaware State campus to John F. Kennedy Airport. Delaware State head coach Lee Hull said on Monday there were some logistical challenges with the team flying from the East Coast to the Hawaiian island, with a six-hour time difference.\n\nThe Hornets and Rainbow Warriors are scheduled to play Saturday at the Clarence T.C.

Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian, who served as Nick Saban's offensive coordinator in 2019–2020, marched his Longhorns into Alabama's Bryant–Denny Stadium and beat the Crimson Tide, 34-24.\n\n“They (Alabama) were 52-1 in their last 53 (home) games, so I guess they’re 52-2 now,\" Sarkisian said after the Longhorns win.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. He said he's \"so proud of my team and my defense. We balled out.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas extends lead to 10 with another haymaker\n\nHave yourself a night Adonai Mitchell.\n\nTexas’ junior receiver caught his second touchdown of the night, a 39-yard pass from QB Quinn Ewers, to extend the Longhorns’ lead over the Crimson Tide to 10 points in the fourth quarter. Mitchell has three receptions for 78 yards, while tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders has has five receptions for 114 yards. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama's 2-point conversion good after 39-yard TD\n\nAlabama isn’t done yet. After giving up two touchdowns to Texas in all of 15-seconds, the Crimson Tide cut the Longhorns’ lead to three points. Alabama’s Jalen Milroe dropped a low snap, but quickly picked it up and found Amari Niblack across the middle for a 39-yard touchdown. Alabama successfully completed a two-point conversion to bring the score to 24-27. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas intercepts Milroe again, up by 11\n\nFifteen seconds later, the Longhorns scored again.\n\nTexas’ Jerrin Thompson picked off Alabama’s Jalen Milroe and returned it 32-yards to the Crimson Tide’s 5-yard line. It marked Milroe’s second pick of the night.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nN0. 10 Texas answers back with TD, leads No. 3 Alabama 20-16\n\nAlabama’s lead didn’t last long. Texas immediately responded by finding the end zone themselves. Texas QB Quinn Ewers completed a 50-yard play to Ja'Tavion Sanders and capped the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Adonai Mitchell to put the Longhorns up 20-16 over the Crimson Tide.\n\nA pass interference call on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold, his second of the night, accelerated Texas’ drive.\n\nAlabama led for one minute and nine seconds. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama takes lead over No. 10 Texas with 49-yard TD\n\nJermaine Burton finally got his touchdown.\n\nAfter two of Burton’s end zone catches were erased due to untimely penalties, quarterback Jalen Milroe connected with Burton for a 49-yard touchdown in the final minute of the third quarter.\n\nIt marked Alabama’s first touchdown of the game and the Crimson Tide took the lead over Texas for the first time. They are up 16-13 over Texas. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas marches down field, but misses field goal\n\nTexas had the opportunity to extend their lead to seven, but Longhorns kicker Bert Auburn missed a 42-yard field goal to the left. That’s not the only missed opportunity of the drive. Texas QB Quinn Ewers went for the end zone on third down, but receiver Xavier Worthy couldn’t come up with the ball.\n\nTexas leads Alabama 13-9. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama’s Caleb Downs not feeling well, out for now\n\nFreshman safety Caleb Downs, the Week 1 SEC Football Player of the Week, is on the sidelines and not feeling well. According to ESPN’s Holly Rowe, Downs “lost his lunch,\" an expression that normally means someone vomited. Kristian Story is in the game at safety for Downs. — Cydney Henderson\n\nAlright, alright, alright: Matthew McConaughey attends Texas-Alabama matchup\n\nMatthew McConaughey is in Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe actor was in attendance Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium for Alabama’s matchup against Texas, his alma mater. (McConaughey graduated from the school in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science degree.) He went particularly crazy during Quinn Ewers’ 44-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy.\n\n\"Hook em, baby!\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama penalty wipes out touchdown, again\n\nAlabama’s offense appeared to find a groove to start the third quarter with quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 34-yard pass to Isaiah Bond to convert a third down. But another penalty (holding) wiped out Milroe’s touchdown pass to Jermaine Burton, the second time a flag has negated a score this game.\n\nCrimson Tide kicker Will Reichard has been the real MVP so far. He nailed a 51-yard field goal to bring Alabama within 4-points of Texas, 13-9. Reichard is responsible for all 9 of Alabama’s points. — Cydney Henderson\n\nFor Shedeur Sanders, Colorado's defeat of Nebraska was 'personal'\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Deion Sanders preached all week about how Saturday’s game against Nebraska was deeply “personal.”\n\nThere were plenty of reasons for this:\n\n∎ It was his first home game as head football coach at Colorado.\n\n∎ It was a sold-out game against the Cornhuskers, Colorado’s hated old rivals.\n\n∎ For his quarterback and son Shedeur, it also was a direct confrontation with Matt Rhule, the Nebraska coach who managed to offend him at times this year, including during pregame warmups when he said he saw him standing on the Buffaloes’ logo at midfield.\n\n“It was extremely personal,” Shedeur Sanders said after the Buffs beat Nebraska at Folsom Field 36-14.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nHalftime: No. 10 Texas 13, No. 3 Alabama 6\n\nThe Longhorns enter halftime with a 7-point lead over the Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nAlabama has struggled to get points on the board, but the Crimson Tide’s offense appeared to ignite with a third-down conversion when quarterback Jalen Milroe found Kobe Prentice for a 28-yard pass up the middle with 44 seconds left in the first half. A touchdown, however, was called back due to a penalty (ineligible lineman downfield) and another Alabama penalty (illegal motion) kept them out of the end zone. They settled for a field goal to cut into Texas’ lead, 13-6.\n\nMilroe has thrown for 80 yards and one interception and run for 52 yards. Prentice leads Alabama receivers with three receptions for 42 yards.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers looked comfortable in the first half. He’s thrown for 138 yards and one touchdown to receiver Xavier Worthy, who has five receptions for 75 yards so far. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas back on top of No. 3 Alabama after Ewer's deep-shot TD\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers connected with receiver Xavier Worthy for a 44-yard touchdown to take a 10-3 lead. Texas had tried another deep shot on the previous play, with Ewers throwing a lateral to Worthy, who then tried to find Adonai Mitchell down the field. But a pass interference penalty was called on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold for pulling Mitchell’s jersey, setting Texas up at the Crimson Tide’s 44-yard line and giving the Longhorns another crack at a big play. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama ties it up after Nick Saban’s gusty fourth down call\n\nAfter Texas took an early 3-0 lead, Alabama answered back with a 12-play, 51-yard drive to tie the game, 3-3. The Crimson Tide converted a 4th and three at Texas’ 42-yard-line, thanks to quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 6-yard pass to Malik Benson. But Alabama’s offense couldn’t get in the red zone and settled for a 43-yard field goal. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas jumps to early lead over No. 3 Alabama after interception\n\nAlabama quarterback Jalen Milroe ran for 12 yards to capture a first down at the Crimson Tide’s 41-yard-line in the first quarter against Texas, but the drive ended two plays later when Texas defensive back Jahdae Barron intercepted Milroe. Barron’s pick resulted in a field goal for Texas to take an early 3-0 lead over Alabama. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 20 Mississippi rallies past No. 22 Tulane with big second half\n\nTulane led Ole Miss by 10 late into the third quarter, but the Rebels used a big fourth quarter to beat the Green Wave 37-20 in Yulman Stadium. Tulane was without starting quarterback Matthew Pratt, and backup Kai Horton played a solid role but was overwhelmed by the defense in the second half. In the second half, Ole Miss outscored Tulane 27-3, and sealed the win with fumble return for a touchdown with less than two minutes left. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMississippi takes fourth-quarter lead on Tulane\n\nThe Rebels defense has made life tough for Tulane in the second half, and it’s offense broke through for a touchdown and capitalized on an interception to take a 20-17 lead over Tulane with 12 minutes left. The Green Wave then fumbled the ball to give Ole Miss the ball back. The Rebels have scored 13 consecutive points since the second quarter — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame overcomes weather delay to get past North Carolina State\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay, Notre Dame used a strong fourth quarter to pull away from North Carolina State and win on the road, 45-24. Leading 24-17 heading into the final 15 minutes, Notre Dame picked off Wolfpack quarterback Brennan Armstrong on back-to-back possessions in the final frame that led to two touchdowns to strengthen the lead. After forcing a fourth-down stop, Sam Hartman tossed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Holden Staes to seal the win before North Carolina State added a touchdown with two minutes left. T he duo of Hartman and running back Audric Estime were tough to stop, as the signal caller threw for 286 yards and four touchdowns on 15-for-24 passing, while Estime had 14 carries for 134 yards and two scores. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 10 Texas at No. 3 Alabama: What to know about the matchup\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nWhy watch: The week’s headliner pits these national name-brand programs and future SEC foes in a rematch of last year’s encounter in Austin, in which the Crimson Tide narrowly escaped 20-19 thanks to some late heroics by Bryce Young. He is off to the NFL, of course, but the early returns on new Crimson Tide starting QB Jalen Milroe are quite positive. Longhorns QB Quinn Ewers, who was knocked out of last year’s tilt with Alabama with a shoulder injury, will be just as eager to show what he can do.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Ewers and the Longhorns’ offense were a bit slow out of the gate last week against Rice. A similar start in Tuscaloosa could prove catastrophic, although the Texas defense should be better equipped to contain Milroe’s two-way ability than that of Middle Tennessee. If it isn’t a one-score game at halftime, there might not be any late drama — Eddie Timanus\n\nTexas vs. Alabama all-time record\n\nThe two programs have faced off 10 times. The matchup will be the second all-time in Tuscaloosa, and Alabama lost the last game 10-0 in 1902. The Longhorns hold a 7-2-1 series lead, but Alabama has won the past two matchups: the BCS Championship Game in 2009 and the matchup in Austin a season ago. The Longhorns have not beaten the Crimson Tide since 1982. — Nick Kelly, The Tuscaloosa News\n\nMiami holds halftime lead against No. 23 Texas A&M\n\nSpecial teams doomed the Hurricanes in the first half as two miscues led to easy points for No. 23 Texas A&M, but they still lead the Aggies 21-17 at halftime.\n\nDylan Joyce had his punt blocked by Jahdae Walker after Miami’s first possession and A&M cashed in three plays later as Conner Weigman scored on a keeper from 1-yard out.\n\nAfter A&M took a 10-0 lead, Miami answered after a 3-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Van Dyke to Colbie Young\n\nThe special teams came into play again when an A&M punt was muffed by Jacolby George at the Miami 7-yard line. Two plays later, Amari Daniels' 9-yard score put the Aggies up 17-7.\n\nVan Dyke (13-of-17, 232 yards, 3 TDs) then went deep to bring the Hurricanes within three, delivering a beautiful throw to freshman Isaiah Horton for 52 yards. After A&M missed a field goal with 57 seconds left, Miami took the lead after Van Dyke drove Miami 75 yards with no timeouts in 44 seconds and hit George on an 11-yard scoring strike. — Scooby Axson\n\nHow to watch Alabama vs. Texas\n\nThe game will be on ESPN and can be streamed on Fubo.

He’s 4-for-8 with 116 yards and the one touchdown pass. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan football score today: Wolverines in control against UNLV\n\nMichigan quarterback JJ McCarthy completed his first 13 pass attempts, and Blake Corum ran for 46 yards and two touchdowns as the Wolverines rolled to halftime with a 21-0 lead against UNLV.\n\nMcCarthy finished the half 17-of-18 for 188 yards with one touchdown to Roman Wilson. McCarthy had completions to seven receivers and added 38 rushing yards.\n\nEach of UNLV’s four first-half possessions ended in a punt, as the Rebels could only muster up 40 yards of total offense. UNLV quarterback Doug Brumfield threw for 58 yards and was sacked five times. — Scooby Axson\n\nNotre Dame football score today: NC State keeping it close\n\nNC State is hanging on at home against No. 11 Notre Dame, down 24-17 and starting the fourth quarter with the ball.\n\nAfter making it a one-score game, the Wolfpack forced a fumble to get great field position on Notre Dame’s side of the field. However, Brayden Narveson missed a 34-yard field goal that would have cut the deficit. The Wolfpack were able to force a punt to get the ball back to start the final 15 minutes. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOle Miss football score today: Tulane leads in major home game for Green Wave\n\nTulane is without starting quarterback Michael Pratt but the Green Wave are holding up in a big home matchup against Ole Miss, up 10-7 in the second quarter.\n\nOle Miss only needed three plays to score a touchdown on its opening drive, but Tulane was able to respond thanks to a 57-yard pass from backup Kai Horton to Lawrence Keys III. The Green Wave were able to punch it in a few plays later, and their defense has forced the Rebels to punt on three straight drives. Valentino Ambrosio nailed a 44-yard field goal to start the second quarter to take the lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh on chain gang for son's youth football game\n\nJim Harbaugh can't be on the Michigan sidelines this week against UNLV because of his self-imposed three-game suspension. But nothing can keep Harbaugh away from football for too long.\n\nHarbaugh picked up a new gig and is spending his second Saturday off working the chains for a youth football game at his son Jack's game, dressed in his usual Michigan striped polo and hat, per a photo posted by ESPN reporter Sean Ritchlin.\n\n“There’s a chance my son Jack’s team is going to be playing at the same time. If he’s playing, I’ll go watch that game,” Harbaugh said the Monday before Michigan’s season opener against East Carolina. “I don’t know if I’ll watch on TV if I won’t be able to watch it. I can’t predict what it’s going to be at the time. It’s uncharted waters for me.\" — Gabriela Carroll\n\nClemson football score today: Turnovers keeping Charleston Southern close\n\nLess than one week after its disastrous loss to Duke, Clemson is in a battle with FCS Charleston Southern, with the Tigers leading 24-17 at the half.\n\nClemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has looked better in the home opener with 184 passing yards, but he made a costly mistake by throwing a pick six in the first quarter. The Tigers also fumbled early in the game and that was returned to the 1-yard line, and the Buccaneers punched it in one play later.\n\nThe Tigers' mistakes have given Charleston Southern hope from what has been a mostly ineffective offensive performance from the Buccaneers. Clemson is outgaining Charleston Southern 265-43. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado no longer coming. The Buffs are here.\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Head coach Deion Sanders and his Colorado football team made a statement to the nation in their first game last week at TCU. One week later, they made another one with less drama and flair, easily beating Nebraska 36-14 Saturday in front of the sold-out crowd of 53,241 at Folsom Field, the largest crowd here since 2008.\n\nAfter finishing 1-11 last season, the Buffaloes improved to 2-0 by overcoming a slow start, capitalizing on early Nebraska turnovers and then holding on to show they’re more than a one-week sensation.\n\nThe Buffs also weren’t nearly as sharp as they were in in last week’s 45-42 win in Fort Worth. They punted four times in their first four possessions Saturday after punting only three times all game the week before.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders even suffered four sacks in the first half but threw touchdown passes in the second and third quarters to help put Colorado up 20-7. The second one went to South Florida graduate transfer Xavier Weaver, who produced his second straight game of at least 100 yards.\n\nThe Buffs now look to go 3-0 with a night game next Saturday at home against Colorado State. −Brent Schrotenboer\n\nNo. 23 Texas A&M at Miami (Fla.) predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Are the Aggies finally ready to live up to their seemingly annual billing? The same question could be asked of the Hurricanes. Both teams handled overmatched opponents as good teams should in Week 1, setting up what could be an interesting clash in the Sunshine State. A&M defeated the Hurricanes in a lackluster 17-9 contest last season, but both teams appear to have more competence on the offensive side this time. Aggies QB Conner Weigman torched New Mexico for five TD passes without a pick under new coordinator Bobby Petrino. Hurricanes QB Tyler Van Dyke wasn’t quite as prolific against the other Miami from Ohio last week, but RBs Henry Parrish and Mark Fletcher lent plenty of ground support.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: The Hurricanes’ much more accomplished secondary featuring DB Kamren Kinchens and the Aggies’ stout ground defense led by LB Edgerrin Cooper could neutralize the respective strengths of the opposing offenses. If that is the case, we might have another low-scoring struggle like the 2022 encounter. But that development would also significantly reduce the game’s blowout potential, so there should still be intrigue in the closing minutes. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Eddie Timanus: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Erick Smith: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Jace Evans: Miami\n\nMiami Paul Myerberg: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Scooby Axson: Miami\n\nIowa at Iowa State how to watch and what to know\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: This one won’t light up the scoreboard as a number of other games on the schedule will, but it should be competitive with the Cy-Hawk Trophy on the line. The Cyclones claimed it a year ago in a 10-7 slog, ending a six-game skid in the series. Unfortunately, not much else went right the rest of the way in a 4-8 campaign, while Iowa managed to go 8-5 despite its well-documented scoring woes. The Hawkeyes should be a bit more productive with Michigan transfer Cade McNamara now quarterbacking the attack, though nagging injuries could again hamper his mobility. The Cyclones will counter with freshman QB Rocco Becht, who had an efficient pick-free debut against Northern Iowa.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Cue the \"take the under: jokes in 3… 2…. Oh, who are we kidding? They’re already out there, especially given that gambling issues stemming from a state-wide investigation have depleted both rosters. But personnel matters aside, both these teams are constructed to win a grind-it-out affair that may not provide many flashy plays. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUtah football score today: Utes survive Baylor\n\nJaylon Glover scored on an 11-yard run with 17 seconds left and Nate Johnson came off the bench in relief of an ineffective Bryson Barnes, leading No. 12 Utah to a comeback 20-13 win against Baylor.\n\nJohnson ran up the middle untouched from seven yards out to tie the score at 13 with two minutes remaining, capping an 8-minute, 15-play, 88-yard drive.\n\nBarnes got the start, subbing for an injured Cameron Rising and went 6-of-19 for 71 yards with an interception and was sacked twice. In the fourth quarter, Johnson completed six of his seven passes for 82 yards.\n\nBaylor got the ball back with 1:54 left but Sawyer Robertson, starting in place of an injured Blake Shapen, forced a pass over the middle which was intercepted by Cole Bishop, who returned it to the Baylor 29, which led to the winning score. The Bears got down to the 22-yard line on their final drive, but Robertson's pass fell incomplete in the end zone as time expired. — Scooby Axson\n\nColorado score today: Shedeur Sanders does dad’s dance to celebrate TD\n\nLike father, like son.\n\nAfter rushing for a 6-yard touchdown to put Colorado up 36-7 over Nebraska, quarterback Shedeur Sanders took a page out of his dad’s playbook for his celebration. Shedeur Sanders hit Deion Sanders’ signature ‘Prime Time’ shuffle in the end zone.\n\nHe’s thrown for 393 yards, two touchdowns by air, one touchdown on the ground and no interceptions on the day. − Cydney Henderson\n\nGeorgia, top-ranked teams score blowout wins\n\nNo. 1 Georgia started off slow with no first-quarter points, but it responded with a dominant second quarter en route to an easy 45-3 win over Ball State.\n\nThe Bulldogs victory marked just one of several top-ranked teams putting up huge victories over smaller schools. No. 4 Ohio State’s offense looked better against FCS Youngstown State in a 45-7 win, and No. 7 Penn State dominated Delaware with a 63-7 thumping of the Fightin' Blue Hens.\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes score after another Nebraska turnover\n\nNebraska hung on for as long as it could, but several miscues later and Colorado is starting to pull away from its rival.\n\nAfter Jeff Sims’ touchdown run cut the deficit to six, Colorado scored 16 unanswered points to put the game nearly out of reach with a 29-7 lead with under 11 minutes left in the game. Trailing 23-7, Nebraska was in need of a score and in Colorado territory, but a botched handoff resulted in a fumble, the fourth turnover of the game for the Cornhuskers.\n\nColorado then marched down the field and capped the drive with a trick-play touchdown for Tar'Varish Dawson. The two-point conversion wasn’t good, but the 22-point lead nearly wraps up another win for Coach Prime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame scores on first play after weather delay\n\nIt appears Notre Dame was ready to play.\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay at NC State, Notre Dame returned to the field with the ball at the Wolfpack 20-yard line. Running back Audric Estime then took the first play back 80 yards to the house for the first touchdown of the game to give the Fighting Irish a 10-0 lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJeff Sims' big run gets Nebraska on the board\n\nIt was a nightmare first half for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims, but things may be turning around thanks to a big run.\n\nOn Nebraska’s opening drive of the third quarter, Sims took a quarterback draw 57 yards down the sideline, untouched and into the endzone to give the Cornhuskers their first points of the day and second touchdown of the season. The touchdown cut the Colorado lead to 13-7. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nVirginia’s Mike Hollins scores TD 10 months after shooting\n\nThere might not be a more important touchdown scored during Week 2 than the one by Virginia senior running back Mike Hollins.\n\nHollins was one of two students hospitalized after a Nov. 13 campus shooting, when a former Virginia football player opened fire on a bus returning from a field trip. Three teammates – Devin Chandley, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry – were killed.\n\nHollins took a second-quarter handoff against James Madison for a 4-yard touchdown, his first trip to the end zone in nearly a year – Sept. 17, 2022 against Old Dominion.\n\nVirginia leads JMU 28-17 in the third quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nAlabama vs. Texas odds\n\nThe top college football betting apps favor No. 3 Alabama in its primetime matchup with 10th-ranked Texas.

I wanted to see it empty and then see the transformation. It's pretty much what we're doing.\" — Gabriela Carroll, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes up big at half\n\nQuarterback Kyle McCord’s inconsistencies during Ohio State’s opener have been washed away, even if only for a week.\n\nMcCord completed 13-of-18 passes during the first half for 253 yards and three touchdowns, including two to Marvin Harrison Jr., as the Buckeyes go into halftime with a 28-7 lead against Youngstown State.\n\nThe Buckeyes have rolled up 339 total yards during the first half. Ohio State registered 380 total yards last week against Indiana. — Casey Moore\n\nNorth Carolina State football scoreboard struck by lightning\n\nDonors at North Carolina State can’t be happy with this one.\n\nThe program’s brand new scoreboard was struck by lightning and shorted out during the Wolfpack’s game against Notre Dame.\n\nFans were cleared at Carter-Finley Stadium with N.C. State trailing the Fighting Irish 3-0 early in the second quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nColorado shuts out Nebraska in first half\n\nColorado’s offense hasn’t been as explosive as it was last week, but its defense is creating all sorts of issues for Nebraska. The Buffaloes have a 13-0 lead at halftime.\n\nTen of the 13 Buffalo points were off turnovers, and they scored all of their points in the final 4:20 of the half. Shedeur Sanders is 14-of-21 with 134 yards and one touchdown, and head coach Deion Sanders said it's the defense keeping the Buffaloes up, forcing three turnovers in the first 30 minutes.\n\n“We wasn’t clicking on all cylinders,” Sanders told Fox Sports at halftime. “The defense has been holding up strong and I'm proud of that.”\n\nA fierce Big 12 rivalry that’s set to renew with Colorado re-joining the conference next year, Sanders has made it known the importance of this game, and he reminded fans before heading back into the locker room.\n\n“This game is personal,” he said. “This game is 13-0, we should be up a lot more.” — Jordan Mendoza\n\nUtah score today: Utes struggling in brutal Texas heat\n\nNo. 12 Utah, playing its second straight week without injured starting quarterback Cameron Rising, is struggling against unranked Baylor, and trails 10-3 at halftime.\n\nThe Bears lost last week against Texas State and are also playing without their top quarterback, Blake Shapen, who injured his knee in that game.\n\nIt was 95 degrees in Waco for the 11 a.m. kickoff with an expected high of 101 by the time the game ends.\n\nUtah’s first half drives ended in three punts, an interception and a Cole Becker 31-yard field goal.\n\nBaylor took a 10-3 lead on a short Sawyer Robertson touchdown run. Robertson threw for 126 yards in the first half, while Dominic Richardson paced the ground game with 67 yards. — Scooby Axson\n\nGeorgia gets insane interception as Bulldogs jump to big lead\n\nEverything is going right for Georgia in the second quarter, as the Bulldogs have built up a 31-0 lead at the half and got an interception you had to see to believe.\n\nDown 14-0, Ball State quarterback Kadin Semonza attempted a pass, but it deflected off a Cardinal player’s back foot, and went right into the hands of Chaz Chambliss for the pick. The Bulldogs put up all 31 first-half points in the second quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes get in end zone after interception\n\nAnother Nebraska turnover, more Colorado points.\n\nColorado is making it a nightmare for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims. After a fumble gave the Buffaloes a 3-0 lead, Sims threw an interception, putting Colorado in another great field position. The Buffaloes wasted no time, as Shedeur Sanders found Tar'Varish Dawson on the very next play for a 30-yard touchdown. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes convert turnover into points for 3-0 lead\n\nColorado is on the board, thanks to another Nebraska fumble.\n\nThe Cornhuskers gave Colorado promising field position after Jeff Sims couldn’t hang onto the ball, the third fumble of the first half and second Nebraska has lost. Colorado got the ball at the 19-yard line and went three-and-out, but the field position helped as Jace Feely nailed a 31-yard field goal to give Colorado a 3-0 lead with a little more than four minutes before halftime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Missed field goal ends Nebraska’s promising drive\n\nThe bad luck continues for the Cornhuskers.\n\nAfter a scoreless 20 minutes, Nebraska went from its 9-yard line to Colorado territory. But things took a turn on a third down, as a man in motion got in the way of the snap and Nebraska was able to fall on it to keep the ball on fourth down. The quick turn of events continued with Tristan Alvano’s 45-yard field goal attempt hitting the right upright, keeping Nebraska and Colorado scoreless with under seven minutes left in the first half. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTerrell Owens, Michael Irvin, Chauncey Billups among stars who show up for Deion's home debut\n\nSome high-profile former athletes made their way to Boulder, Colorado, to watch Deion Sanders coach in his home debut against Nebraska.\n\nA packed house was at Folsom Field for the 10 a.m. local kickoff. Spotted at the game were Pro Football Hall of Famers Terrell Owens, Michael Irvin and Warren Sapp.\n\nChauncey Billups, the Portland Trail Blazers head coach and a Colorado alum, was in attendance along with former Buffaloes quarterback Kordell Stewart. — Scooby Axson\n\nNotre Dame, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest in weather delays\n\nThe biggest disruptor on Saturday afternoon? Weather.\n\nThree games in the early window Saturday are in a weather delay, all still in the first half:\n\nVanderbilt 0, Wake Forest 0\n\nNotre Dame 3, NC State 0\n\nPurdue 7, Virginia Tech 0\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Offense slow in Boulder\n\nAfter last week’s shootout, Colorado is in a defensive battle with Nebraska in Coach Prime’s debut at Folsom Field.\n\nNebraska got into Colorado territory to start the game, but the drive was killed by a fumble. Colorado responded by getting into Nebraska territory, but penalties hurt the Buffaloes and they punted from the Nebraska 35-yard line. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next drives, and Nebraska will begin the second quarter with a punt.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, is 6-for-9 with 40 yards and three carries for 18 yards in the opening frame. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes break tie with another Marvin Harrison Jr. TD\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. had just two catches for 18 yards against Indiana in Ohio State’s 23-3 win last week.\n\nIn the first quarter against Youngstown State, the junior wideout has four receptions for 122 yards and his first two touchdowns of the 2023 campaign.\n\nAfter Harrison’s first TD put Ohio State ahead 7-0, Youngstown State put together a 75-yard scoring drive -- highlighted by a 36-yard pass play on third-and-3 – that tied things up 7-7 at Ohio Stadium.\n\nOhio State followed with a three-and-out, but on its next possession Kyle McCord found Harrison in the end zone for a 39-yard TD.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead 14-7 after one quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nGeorgia gets on the board with punt return touchdown\n\nAfter a slow start on offense, it's the Georgia special teams getting the Bulldogs on the board.\n\nMekhi Mews took a Ball State punt and returned it 69 yards to the house, the first punt return for a touchdown for the Bulldogs in 14 years. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nGeorgia score today: Bulldogs off to sluggish start\n\nOne quarter down and Ball State is giving the defending champions all it can, preventing Georgia from getting on the scoreboard in a 0-0 tie.\n\nAfter a solid kick return to open the game, the Bulldogs offense got it to the Ball State 10-yard line, but Peyton Woodring hooked a 28-yard field goal left. The Cardinals got into Georgia territory on their opening drive, but were forced to punt. Their defense stood tall on the next drive and the Bulldogs had to punt, ending the first quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nVirginia honors three football players killed in shooting\n\nVirginia honored three football players who were killed in November with a moment of silence before their home opener against James Madison at Scott Stadium in Charlottesville.\n\nDevin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry have their numbers painted in the end zone. Virginia will also wear helmet decals of the players' numbers (1, 15 and 41) and sport legacy patches. James Madison will also wear helmet decals in honor of the players\n\n“It’s difficult for me. Some days are harder than others, right, and same for those players and the staff,” Virginia head coach Tony Elliott said this week, via the Daily Progress. “I can’t imagine what it’s like for their families dealing with it. We have an opportunity as a community, as a football program, fan base to pay respect to the three young men, their families, and then also the other 125 guys that have chosen to stay the course, do what’s difficult, and show up every single day.” — Scooby Axson\n\nOhio State score today: Marvin Harrison Jr. catches 71-yard TD for 7-0 lead\n\nThe No. 4 Buckeyes struggled to get anything going on offense during their opener against Big Ten rival Indiana last week. But Ohio State quickly found a successful formula against Youngstown State.\n\nThrow the deep ball to star wideout Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nOn the third play from scrimmage, quarterback Kyle McCord connected with Harrison along the left sideline for a 71-yard touchdown pass and an early 7-0 lead for the Buckeyes in their home opener at “The Shoe” this season. — Casey Moore\n\nDeion Sanders takes the field for home opener in Colorado\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Just minutes before kickoff between Colorado and Nebraska, the sold-out crowd at Folsom Field witnessed arguably the most anticipated entrance in school history.\n\nFirst came Ralphie, Colorado’s live bison mascot, who dashed from her gate onto the field as the crowd roared.\n\nThen came Deion Sanders about a minute later, slowed by his troubled left leg but waving his arms to the crowd as he made his home debut as the Buffaloes new coach.\n\nThe Colorado fans roared. It’s been one week since their Buffs upset TCU in Texas 45-42. And now they face Nebraska, their old rival in a game that issued more than 800 media credentials, the most ever at CU and highest since 2001. It was also the most expensive ticket in CU football history, according to TickPick, an online ticket marketplace that listed prices at $385 and up Friday night.\n\nThe big reason for it is Sanders, whose win last week and flamboyant overhaul of the team have been the talk of the sports world recently after the Buffs finished last year 1-11 under a different coaching staff. — Brent Schrotenboer\n\nCollege football picks Week 2\n\nThe names of elite schools in college football don't get much bigger than Alabama and Texas. The pair represents the upper-crust of programs have shaped a significant history of the sports. So when the Crimson Tide and Longhorns clash Saturday in Tuscaloosa, it's not surprising that most of the country will be on that game. Alabama needs a victory to help silence some of the doubters about the direction of the program. Texas needs a big win to establish credibility after almost 15 years out of the national title picture.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports’ expert picks for all of Saturday’s the ranked games.\n\nColorado QB Shedeur Sanders gets timely motivation from Tom Brady ahead of Nebraska game\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders received a text message from a trusted mentor of his shortly after leading his team to a stunning 45-42 win Saturday at TCU.\n\nThe mentor was Tom Brady, the legendary former NFL quarterback.\n\nHis message was simple: “Don’t be satisfied.”\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nWhy is Deion Sanders on TV so much?\n\nTV companies lined up to show Deion Sanders’ games for their intrigue and entertainment value with Sanders as a new head coach at the highest level of college football.\n\nThen advertisers lined up to buy ads during these games, betting it will get them a big audience for their brands at a cost of around $130,000 for 30 seconds if they bought the air time recently for his next game Saturday against Nebraska.\n\nBefore and after kickoff, the broadcasters themselves then focus on Sanders throughout the game, knowing he's the big reason viewers are tuning in.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nNo. 11 Notre Dame at North Carolina State predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Though the Fighting Irish had to go a long way for one of their two relatively easy wins, this true road game could serve as their first real test of the campaign. The Wolfpack handled a road opener against an improved Connecticut program and now looks to make an even bigger splash. The setting will be familiar for new Notre Dame QB Sam Hartman, who went 2-2 against the Wolfpack at Wake Forest but with neither win coming in Raleigh. N.C. State QB Brennan Armstrong has no history with the Fighting Irish, as he missed Virginia’s 28-3 loss to Notre Dame due to an injury in 2021.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: It probably won’t be a shootout. The Wolfpack defense, anchored by LB Payton Wilson, is stronger than any the new-look Irish offense has seen to date. But Notre Dame isn’t likely to surrender many big gainers either, so the intensity level should still be high in the fourth quarter. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Eddie Timanus: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Erick Smith: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Jace Evans: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Paul Myerberg: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Scooby Axson: Notre Dame\n\nNebraska at No. 25 Colorado predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: Colorado games have suddenly become appointment viewing after the Buffaloes made the biggest splash of opening weekend. They’ll now look to follow their takedown of TCU in their first home game of the Deion Sanders era against old Big Eight rival Nebraska. The Cornhuskers are also under new management with Matt Rhule back in the college game. But his debut outing at Minnesota produced another late collapse to which NU fans have grown all too accustomed. The promising development for the Cornhuskers was the overall performance of the defense, but Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders and his array of fast targets will bring a bit more fire power. Nebraska QB Jeff Sims is well aware he must take better care of the ball.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Colorado’s overall team speed would make the Buffaloes a much stronger comeback candidate should they somehow fall behind. An early Cornhuskers’ deficit would seem more difficult to overcome given Nebraska’s unproven ability to put up fast points.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Eddie Timanus: Colorado\n\nColorado Erick Smith: Colorado\n\nColorado Jace Evans: Colorado\n\nColorado Paul Myerberg: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Scooby Axson: Colorado\n\nTexas vs. Alabama predictions\n\nHere’s who our staff is predicting will win this No. 3 vs. No. 10 matchup:\n\nDan Wolken: Alabama\n\nAlabama Eddie Timanus: Alabama\n\nAlabama Erick Smith: Alabama\n\nAlabama Jace Evans: Alabama\n\nAlabama Paul Myerberg: Alabama\n\nAlabama Scooby Axson: Texas\n\nCollege football Week 2 bold predictions\n\nDisappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football. It's especially true early in the season as teams haven't gotten into the swing of the schedules and are more prone to mistakes.\n\nThere is the potential for surprises Saturday with a slate of games that could produce unlikely results that we've come to look forward to each weekend.\n\nOur college football staff makes bold predictions for Week 2.\n\nBig college football games this weekend\n\nWeek 2 of the college football season is upon us. The menu this week features the second top-10 clash of the young season (No. 3 Alabama vs. No. 10 Texas), a perhaps under-the-radar Top 25 showdown with huge entertainment potential, and a number of other power-conference encounters that could have long-term implications.\n\nSo, here are the six blockbuster games to watch, with the standard advice that you should keep an eye on the scoreboard and a hand on the remote in case unexpected developments and/or frantic finishes unfold as they inevitably do. — Eddie Timanus\n\nCollege football Week 2 odds\n\nNo. 11 Notre Dame is also favored by more than a touchdown (-7.5) over NC State.\n\nIn the late-night slate, two California schools will face each other for the last time as Pac-12 members. Stanford is a 29.5-point underdog against No. 6 USC.

Mississippi State transfer Sawyer Robertson will get the nod for Baylor on Saturday. — Scooby Axson\n\nCollege football conferences 2023\n\nConfused by all the conference changes coming in major college sports within the next year? It's been difficult to follow all the moving pieces during past weeks and months.\n\nWe knew last summer that more lucrative TV deals would soon lure UCLA and Southern California to the Big Ten for the 2024 season. Likewise, Texas and Oklahoma announced plans to move to the SEC. But little did we know how many other programs also would soon be moving.\n\nWhat's transpired in the Pac-12, Big 12 and Big Ten in the recent weeks has grabbed most of the college realignment headlines, but big changes are coming to both the Power Five and the Group of Five by this time next year. This season, the Big 12 will welcome three teams from the American Athletic Conference: Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston.\n\nIn the past four decades, teams moved, conferences grew and a few collapsed. That doesn't sound much different than today's situation – other than the rapid pace at which these changes are unfolding. Here’s everything you need to know. — Jim Sergent\n\nWhere is 'College GameDay' in Week 2?\n\nESPN’s “College GameDay” crew is in Tuscaloosa for a battle between football superpowers No. 3 Alabama and No. 10 Texas on Saturday.

It will only include a select few games, however, as most teams will start their respective seasons during Week 1 over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nREQUIRED READING:College football Week 0 breakdown starts with Florida State-Georgia Tech clash\n\nAs such, the technical first weekend of college football is called \"Week 0\" — and has had some intriguing matchups over the years. That includes the Big Ten meeting between Nebraska and Northwestern in 2022 and the historical Notre Dame-Navy rivalry in 2023. Both of those games were also in Dublin, which has become something of a traditional host site for such contests.\n\nWith that, here's everything to know about Week 0, which will have the first college football action of the 2024 season:\n\nWhat is college football Week 0?\n\nWeek 0 is the unofficial first week of college football, and typically hosts only a handful of games as opposed to a full schedule. The vast majority of teams open their season in Week 1 over Labor Day weekend.\n\nIndeed, NCAA Rule 17.11.4 states the earliest a college football team can scrimmage or play an outside opponent is the Thursday before Labor Day (which in 2024 falls on Aug. 29). So how then are Florida State, Georgia Tech and others able to play on Saturday?\n\nThe NCAA has a few exceptions to the rule, including the 17.11.4.3 exception, regarding in-season foreign competition. Per the NCAA:\n\n\"An institution that is scheduled to play a regular-season game in a foreign country may play its first permissible contest with outside competition on the Saturday prior to the Thursday preceding Labor Day. An institution that uses this exception must provide its student-athletes with five additional days off from all countable athletically related activities during the institution's declared playing season.\"\n\nWeek 0 games don't count as an extra game on each team's schedule, as they'll make up for the early week with an extra week off during the season. For example, Florida State still plays 12 regular season games, but will have three weeks off on Sept. 7, Oct. 12 and Nov. 16.\n\nREQUIRED READING:College football Week 0 kicks off and we're also talking College Football Playoff this week\n\nThat still leaves three other games on Saturday that don't fall under the foreign competition exception: Montana State at New Mexico; SMU at Nevada; and Delaware State at Hawaii, all of which will be played in the U.S.\n\nEach of those teams is able to compete in Week 0 thanks to the 17.11.4.1 exception, which pertains to teams that compete in Hawaii in a given season:\n\n\"An institution that is scheduled to play a regular-season game in Hawaii may play its first permissible contest with outside competition on the Saturday prior to the Thursday preceding Labor Day. If the institution's first opponent of the season is not a member institution located in Hawaii, the institution’s first opponent of the season may also play its first contest (game or scrimmage) with outside competition on the Saturday prior to the Thursday preceding Labor Day.\"\n\nAside from Delaware State — which is playing at the Rainbow Warriors on Saturday — both Nevada (Oct. 26) and New Mexico (Nov. 30) are scheduled to play at Hawaii in 2024, allowing them and their opponents to play in Week 0.\n\nWeek 0 college football schedule\n\nHere's the schedule for Week 0 of the 2024 college football season:\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nNo. 10 Florida State at Georgia Tech (Dublin) | Noon | ESPN (Fubo)\n\nMontana State at New Mexico | 4 p.m. | Fox Sports 1 (Fubo)\n\nSMU at Nevada | 8 p.m. | CBS Sports Network (Fubo)\n\nDelaware State at Hawaii | 11:59 p.m.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

A half a dozen members of the Football Championship Subdivision will have played two games – by the end of Week 1. What’s more, one team will have already played two conference games.\n\nBearing all that in mind, however, Week 0 presents an abbreviated slate, with just four games involving FBS squads. But for true fans of the sport, this jump start to the season will definitely whet the appetite. Here’s a quick look at the Saturday schedule.\n\nAll the college football news to know: Sign up for USA TODAY's Sports newsletter.\n\nNo. 10 Florida State vs. Georgia Tech in Dublin, noon ET, ESPN\n\nThe easy choice for headliner of the day finds the Seminoles and Yellow Jackets leaping straight into ACC play overseas. It is in fact the first of two consecutive conference contests for FSU, which will play host to Boston College on Labor Day night to close out Week 1. Florida State is the lone ranked team to take the field on opening day and will be significantly favored, but the Yellow Jackets pulled off some upsets in 2023 and have enough returning talent to make a game of this one. The defenses might have the upper hand in the early stages. Newly arrived Seminoles QB DJ Uiagalelei and a rebuilt receiving corps must negotiate a Georgia Tech secondary featuring DB Clayton Powell-Lee that could be the unit’s strongest group. Yellow Jackets QB Haynes King has a year in the system under his belt but will face a nasty FSU pass rush led by DE Patrick Payton.\n\nMontana State at New Mexico, 4 p.m. ET, FS1\n\nThe Lobos are the first of three Mountain West squads playing at home in Week 0. They’ll look to get the Bronco Mendenhall era in Albuquerque off on the right foot. The But they’ll likely get a stiff test from the Bobcats, perennial playoff contenders in the Football Championship Subdivision ranked fourth in the preseason FCS coaches poll. Montana State’s strength is its ground game, a big part of which is mobile QB Tommy Mellott. Finding real estate could be difficult against an FBS-caliber defense, even a rebuilt one like New Mexico’s. The Lobos’ attack will be in the hands of QB Devon Dampier, and his primary WR Caleb Medford is a candidate for a breakout season.\n\nLEFT OUT:Five teams snubbed in the preseason Top 25 ranking\n\nWHAT TO KNOW:Outlooks for every team in preseason poll\n\nSMU at Nevada, 8 p.m. ET, CBSSN\n\nAmong the trio of Mountain West clubs in action on Saturday, the Wolf Pack are the only ones hosting another Bowl Subdivision team. The Mustangs will get an early taste of life on the road as they embark on their new era in the ACC. Nevada is not exactly expected to contend in the MWC, so any SMU struggles might set off alarm bells among its fans even on the road. Incumbent QB Preston Stone could quell any potential anxieties quickly if he gets the Mustangs rolling early.\n\nDelaware State at Hawaii, 11:59 p.m. ET\n\nYou’ll have to stream this one if you’re curious, and Rainbow Warrior fans had better hope there is little drama as Timmy Chang’s third campaign helming his alma mater kicks off. His team would do well, however, to remember Howard, another MEAC squad, pulling off a historic upset of fellow Mountain West member UNLV back in 2017. Nevertheless, Hawaii will want to make short work of this one with UCLA coming to the islands next week, and the Delaware State's travel woes getting to Honolulu undoubtedly didn’t help their own preparations.\n\nWANNA BET?

But Veach and Bleymaier were up until about 2 a.m., well past final bed-check, clearly violating curfew.\n\nNo, they hadn't sneaked out to go to a nearby bar or a club.\n\nThis is what they were doing:\n\n\"We were watching WAC football on ESPN, and Veach would stay up with me,\" Bleymaier said about the Western Athletic Conference.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nTOUGH LOVE:The unique way Jalen Hurts ‘pushes’ Eagles' receivers to be great – and how they push back\n\nSUPER PICKS:Eagles or Chiefs? Martin Frank gives his Super Bowl 57 prediction\n\nWhy WAC games on a Friday night? Bleymaier's father, Gene, was Boise State's athletic director at the time. And their games were often featured as the late game.\n\nAnd as Bleymaier described it, Veach was \"a football junkie.\"\n\n\"We’d be watching it together, and (Veach) would know all the players in the WAC,\" Bleymaier said. “I knew many of them because I grew up with them, so I’d be like, ‘How do you know those WAC football players?’ But his mind was always working. He just saw them and remembered, ‘Oh yeah, the guy from Hawaii, the guy from Reno.’\n\n\"He knew everything about them. And I was like, the guy is either really weird or really smart.\"\n\nIt turned out to be the latter. That's because everything about those nights at UD road games to Maine, William & Mary, and James Madison that season led the two UD wide receivers to the Super Bowl.\n\nSIRIANNI AND REID:Andy Reid once gave Nick Sirianni his worst moment; how it led Eagles coach to Super Bowl\n\nVeach is in the Super Bowl for the third time in four years as the general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs, who will face the Eagles on Sunday. Veach is the one who famously convinced head coach Andy Reid to trade up to draft generational quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the first round in 2017.\n\nBeginning the next season, when Mahomes became the starting quarterback, the Chiefs have gotten at least as far as the AFC championship game.\n\nVeach has helped build the Chiefs into a perennial powerhouse with two other UD alums in Bleymaier, who is the Chiefs' wide receivers coach, and Matt Nagy, the Chiefs' quarterbacks coach.\n\nNagy and Veach were teammates at UD from 1998-2000. Nagy was the Hens' star quarterback, setting more than 20 passing records at the time. Veach played running back and wide receiver.\n\n\"Matt and I were close at Delaware, and Joe actually came on when I was a GA, and we hit it off right away,\" Veach said. \"It’s awesome to see Matt and Joe and what they’ve done.\n\n\"There must be something in the water at Delaware.\"\n\nStarting as Eagles interns\n\nNagy and Veach didn't stay up late watching West Coast college football games while at Delaware. But they both knew the game well enough to know exactly where each would be on the field.\n\n\"We always had this great feel for each other,\" Nagy said. \"I knew he would always be in the right spot.\"\n\nBleymaier was much the same way when he was at UD from 2002-05. He was a key component of UD's national championship season in 2003.\n\nAnd they have all paid their dues in climbing the coaching/scouting ladder to their current roles with the Chiefs.\n\nVeach began in 2004 as a coaching intern with Reid and the Eagles. Nagy spent six seasons playing in the Arena Football League before becoming a summer intern with the Eagles in 2008. Bleymaier was a summer intern with the Eagles from 2007-09.\n\n\"I remember getting a phone call from Veach (in 2004), and he said, ‘Hey, I just got a call from Coach Reid, and he wants me to come interview with him as a possibility of getting in with the Eagles,'\" Nagy said. \"It blew me away because growing up in the Philadelphia area, and here's Coach Reid calling Veach to get in (the profession), and he does get in.\n\n\"And then … a few years went by, and Veach calls me and says, ‘Hey, come do this internship in training camp.’ Once that happened, I was looking at it like a player. When I got into it as an intern in coaching, and I knew Veach was working his way up, that’s when we started thinking that this could be pretty cool down the road.\"\n\nBy then, Reid had moved Veach to the scouting department, and soon after he made Nagy a quality control coach on offense. Bleymaier, meanwhile, went into business after his summer internship with the Eagles.\n\nBleymaier got back into coaching in 2013 as offensive quality control coach at the University of Colorado.\n\nMoving to Kansas City\n\nThe Eagles had fired Reid after 14 seasons following the 2012 season, and he was quickly hired by the Chiefs. Reid took Veach with him as a pro and college football analyst before naming him co-director of player personnel in 2015.\n\nNagy came with Reid, too, and was named quarterbacks coach with Doug Pederson as the offensive coordinator.\n\nWhen Pederson became the Eagles' coach in 2016, Nagy replaced him as offensive coordinator. He served in that role in 2017, when Mahomes was a rookie sitting behind veteran Alex Smith. Then Nagy became the Bears' head coach for four seasons before returning this season.\n\nIt was an easy decision for Nagy to return to the Chiefs as a quarterbacks coach.\n\n\"Brett, Coach Reid, Patrick, and being a part of that process when he got drafted,\" Nagy said. \"So all of us, just kind of being together, it felt like home. They welcomed me back with open arms, and it’s just been almost storybook. ... (Mahomes) has grown so much from his rookie year, and I'm just helping him in certain ways when I can.\n\n\"How lucky am I being able to coach Patrick? It’s pretty cool.\"\n\nIn 2016, Bleymaier left Colorado and took the same role with the Chiefs. Bleymaier became the assistant quarterbacks in 2018 and moved to wide receivers coach in 2021.\n\nVeach, meanwhile, became the general manager in 2017. Reid wanted someone he could trust in that role, thus enabling him to focus solely on football. When Reid was coaching the Eagles, he also had the final say on personnel decisions.\n\nThat was still the case when Howie Roseman became the Eagles' general manager in 2010. But once Reid got to Kansas City, he wanted to focus solely on coaching. John Dorsey became the GM, and then Veach replaced him.\n\n\"It’s hard to do both,\" Reid said last week about coaching and personnel decisions. \"I’ve got guys around me that are really good. Brett Veach is really good. Dorsey was good. And so, let those guys do their job, and then I’ll focus in on the football part.\n\n\"I enjoy that part.\"\n\nLate-night scouting\n\nBut let's get back to Veach and Bleymaier and those hotel lobbies watching WAC football two decades ago.\n\nBefore those games, Gene Bleymaier would talk with his son about Boise State's opponent.\n\n\"My dad would say, ‘This guy is really tough to tackle in the open field, so we really gotta try to wrap him up,’\" Bleymaier said. \"Then Veach and I would be watching the game, and Veach would say, ‘Hey, that running back from Hawaii is really tough to tackle in the open field.’\n\n\"And I’d be like, ‘Yeah, I know, that’s what the coaches told my dad. How did you know that?’\"\n\nThat's still the case.\n\nLast spring, Veach traded the Chiefs' best wide receiver, Tyreek Hill, who had 1,239 yards receiving, to the Dolphins. His speed was instrumental in opening up the field for star tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nBut Hill wanted a contract in the $25 million-$30 million per year range, and the Chiefs had already signed Mahomes to a 10-year contract worth as much as $450 million. They also had high-priced veterans in Kelce, tackle Orlando Brown and defensive tackle Chris Jones.\n\nSure, maybe Veach could have restructured Hill's contract to fit him under the NFL’s salary cap. Instead, he traded Hill to Miami for five draft picks − a first-rounder, second-rounder and fourth-rounder in 2022, and a fourth- and sixth-rounder in 2023. The Dolphins signed Hill to a four-year deal worth as much as $120 million.\n\nVeach, meanwhile, used that money to sign lower-cost receivers Marquez Valdes-Scantling and JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nVeach then drafted four of the Chiefs’ five starting defensive backs last spring in first-rounder Trent McDuffie, second-rounder Bryan Cook, fourth-rounder Joshua Williams and seventh-rounder Jaylen Watson. The four combined to play more than 2,000 snaps in 2022.\n\nAs a team, Chiefs rookies played more snaps than any other team.\n\nThis is how championship teams have to be built once a quarterback gets that extension. And the Eagles could face that as soon as next season if quarterback Jalen Hurts gets an extension in Mahomes' salary range.\n\n\"When you have a talented roster like we do, you have to make some moves,\" Veach said. \"We’ve invested a lot of time in the scouting process ... and it's certainly gratifying for us knowing that the process that we have has worked.\"\n\nRevamping and sustaining\n\nThere is no easy way to do this. The NFL's salary cap is designed for parity, to give every team a chance. That's what makes these perennial championship runs all the more unlikely.\n\nIn many ways, the Chiefs aren't supposed to be doing this, much like the Patriots weren't supposed to win six Super Bowls during Tom Brady's 20 seasons at quarterback. That includes a stretch beginning in 2012 when the Patriots were in seven straight AFC championship games, winning three Super Bowls.\n\nVeach knows that success begins and ends with the quarterback.\n\nSo Veach didn't hesitate when he zeroed in on Mahomes, trading up to No. 12 in the first round of the 2017 draft when many projected him as a second-rounder. Then the Chiefs watched Mahomes blossom into a star, with guidance from Nagy and Bleymaier, throwing for an NFL-high 5,250 yards this season.\n\nMahomes, who played at Texas Tech, wasn't a slam dunk star back then. But it was a validation of what Veach and Bleymaier did violating curfew during those late nights in Orono, Maine.\n\nVeach continued that by revamping the roster over the years, all while keeping the Chiefs contending for Super Bowls.\n\n\"The quarterback, the head coach are the two factors that really determine your success, and your ability to sustain success,\" Veach said. \"So you’re going to exhaust every ounce of resources that you have (for Mahomes).\n\n\"We were all on the same page organizationally. We just made it a point to do whatever we had to do to get a guy like Pat.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

That led to changes in the coaching staff with Kellen Moore hired to run the offense, Vic Fangio the defense, while head coach Nick Sirianni takes on a new CEO type of role.\n\nIt's also quite possible that the Eagles are counting on two of their rookies to win starting jobs, or at the very least contribute right away. And it's possible that one or two more rookies could play a significant role this season.\n\nHere, then, are the top position battles as the Eagles report to training camp Tuesday and begin practicing Wednesday:\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nLinebacker: Nakobe Dean vs. Devin White vs. Zack Baun\n\nIt won't take long to know where Dean stands in the Eagles' pecking order. After a disappointing and injury-plagued 2023, the Eagles signed veterans Devin White, Zack Baun and Oren Burks in free agency, and drafted Jeremiah Trotter Jr., in the fifth round.\n\nWhite, picked No. 5 overall in the 2019 draft, never lived up to those expectations in Tampa Bay, and had lost his starting job by the end of last season. He's still better than anyone the Eagles have, so he's a strong possibility for one of the two spots.\n\nIt would seem like Dean would be a lock for the second. But during the spring, the Eagles used Baun, who's also an edge rusher, with White on the first team, while Dean and Burks were with the second unit. Was that because Dean was just getting cleared from foot surgery? Or was that a sign that Baun could be the guy next to White?\n\nWe'll find out soon enough.\n\nRight guard: Tyler Steen vs. Matt Hennessy vs. Mekhi Becton vs. Trevor Keegan\n\nThis could be the most intriguing battle of camp. Cam Jurgens, who started at right guard last season, is moving to center to replace the retired Jason Kelce.\n\nSteen was the Eagles' third-round pick in 2023. But he had never played guard until the Eagles tried him there last summer. Steen got a start in place of an injured Jurgens last November. But Steen was overmatched, and when Jurgens was injured again later in the season, Sua Opeta started.\n\nOpeta left in free agency, and the Eagles signed veteran Matt Hennessy, who spent most of his career at center, for depth at both positions. Don't be surprised if Mekhi Becton, a 2020 first-round pick of the Jets as a tackle, gets in the competition even though he has never played guard before getting some reps at left guard at minicamp in June.\n\nThe Eagles also drafted Trevor Keegan in the fifth round out of Michigan. A strong camp could put him in the running, too. There's also veteran Max Scharping and sixth-round pick Dylan McMahon.\n\nCOUNTING THEM DOWN:Who are the 9 most interesting Philadelphia Eagles for a Super Bowl season? Our countdown\n\nNo. 3 wide receiver: Parris Campbell vs. John Ross vs. 2 rookies\n\nThe Eagles certainly don't seem to be raising alarm bells here. After all, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith get the vast majority of the targets, and the Eagles also have tight end Dallas Goedert and running back Saquon Barkley as talented receivers.\n\nBut one thing veterans Campbell and Ross can do is stretch the field with their speed. The same is true of fifth-round pick Ainias Smith. Sixth-round pick Johnny Wilson, who's 6-foot-6, 231 pounds, can serve as a third wide receiver by using his size and jump ball ability.\n\nStill, none are locks to serve as bona-fide No. 3 receivers. For all of Campbell's speed, he averaged just 5.2 yards per catch last season with the Giants. Ross, who held the Combine record for the 40-yard dash for 7 years at 4.22, has been out of the NFL since 2021.\n\nSmith and Wilson are unproven.\n\nCornerback: Isaiah Rodgers vs. Kelee Ringo vs. Quinyon Mitchell\n\nThis is for the job of starting opposite Darius Slay, a five time Pro Bowl selection. Whoever wins the job will be tested often. Rodgers has started 10 games in three season with the Colts before serving a one-year suspension for violating the NFL's policy on gambling. Ringo, who had a strong spring, had mixed results last season as a rookie.\n\nNo doubt, the Eagles would love Mitchell, the team's first-round pick, to win the job. But that's a lot to ask for a rookie, especially when the Eagles haven't had a Week 1 rookie starter at cornerback since Eric Allen in 1988.\n\nNo. 2 running back: Kenny Gainwell vs. Will Shipley\n\nThere are three factors working against Gainwell. The first is that Barkley is an accomplished receiver and pass protector in addition to being an elite runner, so there won't be many chances for Gainwell.\n\nThe second is that Gainwell hasn't taken advantage of the chances in his three previous seasons. The third is that Gainwell is eligible for free agency after this season and the Eagles drafted Shipley in the fourth round.\n\nIf Shipley picks up the offense quickly enough in camp, he could be the one giving Barkley a breather during a few series each game.\n\nNickel cornerback: Avonte Maddox vs. Cooper DeJean\n\nThis will be another intriguing battle. The Eagles haven't officially decided on DeJean, their second-round pick, as a nickel. But that could be his easiest path to a starting job after he played all over the secondary in college at Iowa.\n\nMaddox clearly has the experience and ability to win that job. But injuries have taken a toll. Maddox played a total of 13 games the last two seasons, and the Eagles released him in the spring before re-signing him to a one-year deal for less money.\n\nMaddox is not part of the future, while DeJean is. For the Eagles, that future could begin this season.\n\nBackup QB: Kenny Pickett vs. Tanner McKee\n\nSure, this is a longshot for McKee considering that the Eagles traded for Pickett, who was the Steelers' first-round pick in 2022 (No. 20 overall). But remember how well McKee played last year in the preseason, with many fans clamoring for him to unseat veteran Marcus Mariota, himself a former first-round pick.\n\nMariota, of course, served as Jalen Hurts' backup last season.\n\nBut look at it this way: If Pickett had lived up to expectations, he'd still be a Steeler. McKee, meanwhile, has had an entire season to learn from Hurts. It's possible the most accurate QB could win the backup job, and accuracy has never been Pickett's strong suit, nor McKee's in college. In two NFL seasons, Pickett has thrown 13 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Eagles tie ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − So there the Eagles were, with rookie quarterback Tanner McKee leading two touchdown drives in the second half, with a chance for a game-winning drive in the final minutes of the game.\n\nSure, the drive fell short and the Eagles and Browns played to an 18-18 tie Thursday night in a preseason game. But McKee's play brought a morose Lincoln Financial Field crowd to life after watching the struggles of backup quarterback Marcus Mariota in the first half.\n\nAnd it led to questions as to whether the rookie sixth-round draft pick has a chance to unseat Mariota as the backup quarterback.\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni quickly squashed that, however.\n\n\"Way too early on this,\" Sirianni said. \"Marcus is our backup, and I'm pleased with the way Tanner is playing.\"\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nMcKee was firing passes all over the field. The sixth-round draft pick completed 10 of 18 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. Those numbers would've looked even better if five of those incompletions weren't dropped by receivers.\n\nThis after Mariota, the veteran free agent, struggled in the first half, completing just 9 of 17 passes for 86 yards and an interception.\n\nIt was the second consecutive game that McKee played better than Mariota. It was easy to notice McKee's poise in the pocket, his ability to get the ball out quickly, and the touch on his passes.\n\n\"I would see the ball consistently going to the right spot, and on time,\" Sirianni said. \"That’s what you want for your quarterback, and with accuracy.\"\n\nMariota, when asked to describe his play, replied: \"Sloppy. I can do a better job of getting our guys to operate cleaner and more efficiently. But that’s what the preseason is for, being able to get some of that stuff ironed out, clean up some of the rust, and find ways to get better.\"\n\nMcKee, of course, has no expectations of taking anyone's job, saying he only worries about things he can control.\n\nBut there are so many things McKee likes about the Eagles offense, even though he's not nearly the running threat that Hurts and Mariota are.\n\n\"I think it’s a different style of play, obviously,\" McKee said. \"I think (the coaches) do a great job of adapting the play calls to what I do best. And when Jalen gets in there, or Marcus or Ian (Book) are in there, I think it’s play to your skillset.\n\n\"Maybe I have a different mindset of trying to squeeze it in there instead of scrambling and make a few guys miss.\"\n\nThere's that, too. McKee was sacked three times, the same as Mariota. But he's never been known as a scrambler. In fact, he said that offensive lineman Fred Johnson, who weighs 327 pounds, insists that he's faster than McKee.\n\n\"I don't know,\" McKee said. \"We'll see.\"\n\nIt's clear why Hurts and Watson sat out\n\nThe reason both quarterbacks Hurts and Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson, not to mention the rest of the perceived starters, sat out Thursday became painfully obvious with the injuries.\n\nIn addition, the starters on both teams got all the work they needed during the joint practice sessions during the week. That was where both teams could be physical − as evidenced by the shoving matches Tuesday − in a controlled setting, without some third-string defensive lineman taking out a quarterback during the game.\n\nThree Eagles players suffered injuries that required a cart. Cornerback Zech McPhearson suffered an ankle injury, and wide receiver Tyrie Cleveland and defensive tackle Moro Ojomo each suffered neck injuries.\n\nSirianni said Ojomo and Cleveland were moving all of their extremities as they were carted off the field. Sirianni didn't have an update on McPhearson after the game, but he couldn't put any weight on his right leg.\n\nThere was also a shoulder injury for first-round pick Nolan Smith, albeit not nearly as serious.\n\n\"You never want to see that,\" Sirianni said. \"Your heart goes out to everyone that gets hurt in a game because they are working so hard to make the team.\"\n\nNo doubt, the starters will sit out the preseason finale next Thursday against Indianapolis, too.\n\nTanner McKee keeps moving Eagles in 2nd half\n\nMcKee took over for Mariota to start the third quarter. He led a touchdown drive on his first possession. In the fourth quarter, his 35-yard pass to Tyree Jackson got the Eagles to the Browns' 10. But the Eagles couldn't score as Deon Cain couldn't hold McKee's pass in the back of the end zone on 4th-and-goal from the 3.\n\nSLAY SAYS:Browns say Eagles took 'cheap shots' at Deshaun Watson; why Darius Slay loves 'Milk Check'\n\nHOW TO WATCH:What channel is the Eagles' game on? How to watch Eagles vs. Browns on Thursday\n\nOn the first drive, McKee completed both of his passes, for 27 yards. His first pass went to Joseph Ngata for 12 yards to the Eagles' 42. After Trey Sermon's 10-yard run, McKee then completed a bubble screen to Devon Allen, who turned that into a 15-yard gain down to Cleveland's 33 yard line.\n\nOn the next play, Sermon ran up the middle, bounced off a tackler and went all the way into the end zone. That gave the Eagles a 10-8 lead with 11:59 left in the third quarter.\n\nSermon led the Eagles with 54 yards on 5 carries.\n\nMariota struggles badly in 1st quarter\n\nMariota wasn't effective in the first quarter as he got the start for the second week in a row. He often threw high to receivers.\n\nMariota was 3-for-9 for 32 yards in the first quarter. He also threw an interception when he overthrew Grant Calcaterra with the Eagles at midfield after Rashaad Penny picked up a first down on a 16-yard run.\n\nThe Eagles' only points in the first half came on Jake Elliott's 56-yard field goal after Mariota threw a bit high to Olamide Zaccheaus, who couldn't hold the pass. Zaccheaus left with a shoulder injury after the play.\n\nEagles 1st possession results in a safety\n\nThe Eagles appeared to dodge a bullet when Browns running back John Kelly fumbled on 1st-and-goal from the Eagles' 1. Nakobe Dean forced the fumble and K'Von Wallace recovered it, giving the Eagles the ball at the 2.\n\nBut after an incomplete pass, Kenny Gainwell, getting his first action of the summer, was tackled in the end zone for a safety. That gave Cleveland an early 2-0 lead.\n\nHaason Reddick has thumb surgery; will he return for opener?\n\nEdge rusher Haason Reddick had thumb surgery this week, but the Eagles expect him back for the opener on Sept. 10 against New England.\n\nReddick, who had 16 sacks last season, suffered the injury at some point during practice Monday with the Browns. He didn't practice Tuesday, and likely won't for at least a few weeks.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert.\n\nThe fact that it's not a pipe dream for the Eagles to land the five-time Pro Bowl selection is a testament, of course, to Hurts. Hopkins, in a recent \"I Am Athlete\" podcast before he was released by the Cardinals, listed Hurts as one of the five quarterbacks he would want to play for.\n\nBACK TO WORK:Kelce: There's one difference in Jalen Hurts after signing big contract as Eagles OTAs near\n\nSTAR POWER?DeAndre Hopkins to Eagles? Wide receiver ranks Jalen Hurts as QB he'd want to play with\n\nAnd sure, there's every reason to think that the Eagles would be interested in Hopkins, 30, who as recently as 2020 had 1,407 yards receiving and twice topped 1,500 yards in his previous 10 seasons. Last season, Hopkins had 717 yards receiving despite missing six games to serve an NFL suspension, well on pace to surpass 1,000 yards if he had played a full season.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nAs you might guess, Hopkins also listed the top QBs in the NFL as the others he would want to play with in Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes, Buffalo's Josh Allen, the Los Angeles Chargers' Justin Herbert and the Baltimore Ravens' Lamar Jackson.\n\nOf the five teams, the Eagles have the most salary cap space, at about $13.5 million, according to overthecap.com. But the Ravens and Chargers are also in the ballpark. The Bills and Chiefs are pretty much maxed out.\n\nThat Hopkins would put Hurts on that list shows the high regard that Hurts is held in around the NFL. That's nothing new to the Eagles after Hurts led them to the Super Bowl last season, then threw for 304 yards and ran for 70 more in the Eagles' 38-35 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWill that be enough for Hopkins to accept being a third or fourth option if he were to sign with the Eagles? After all, Hopkins would be a No. 1 or No. 2 option on the other teams on his QB list, all of whom could be considered Super Bowl contenders.\n\nKeep in mind that the Eagles signed James Bradberry around this time last year after he was released by the Giants. That worked out pretty well.\n\nMeanwhile, the Eagles will be busy with their OTAs that begin Tuesday. They'll have three days of practices this week followed by two next week before breaking until training camp in late July. Will Hopkins be an Eagle by then? We'll find out.\n\nHere are 5 questions for the (as of now) Hopkins-less Eagles:\n\nCan Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis become the top DT pair over Fletcher Cox?\n\nStarting jobs, of course, aren't won in OTAs, especially when there's no contact, and no 11-on-11 team drills that involve offensive and defensive linemen.\n\nBut there are things we can learn about first-round pick Jalen Carter and his former Georgia defensive linemate Jordan Davis, the Eagles' first-round pick in 2022. For Carter, conditioning might have been an issue during the rookie minicamp, which Eagles coach Nick Sirianni didn't deny while pointing out that none of the players on hand were ready to play an NFL game yet.\n\nFine, but Carter will get an idea of what's expected now that the veterans are here. Davis might have struggled with conditioning last season too. He was starting to find a niche in the rotation when he sprained his ankle last Oct. 30 against the Steelers and went on injured reserve.\n\nWhen Davis returned, the Eagles had signed veterans Ndamukong Suh and Linval Joseph, and Davis' playing time was cut drastically.\n\nSuh, Joseph and Javon Hargrave did not return. Fletcher Cox did on a one-year deal. But he's also entering his 12th season, and isn't at the level he was from 2015-20 when he was selected to six straight Pro Bowls. Cox will still have a major role, but the Eagles would certainly like to keep him at around 50-60% of the defensive snaps.\n\nWhether they can depends on how much they can rely on Carter and Davis. So conditioning will be crucial for both.\n\nAre D'Andre Swift and Rashaad Penny better than Miles Sanders?\n\nSwift and Penny might not be better than Sanders as individuals after Sanders had a career-high 1,269 yards rushing last season. That is double the career highs for Penny, signed as a free agent, and Swift, acquired in a trade. But together, the two can replace Sanders' yardage.\n\nBy playing in a rotation, along with Kenny Gainwell and Boston Scott, Swift and Penny can play to their strengths. And they will also benefit, much like Sanders did, by having Hurts as a dynamic runner as well. It's possible that neither will amass 1,000 yards. Combined, however, they could surpass 2,000 yards from scrimmage.\n\nThe OTAs will give the Eagles an idea of how they can use both running backs in the offense.\n\nHow the Eagles showed Nakobe Dean that he's the man at linebacker\n\nOne player who won't face competition as a starter is Dean.\n\nLast season, the 2022 third-round pick rarely played behind veterans T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White. Both left as free agents, and the Eagles added only Nicholas Morrow as a free agent from the Bears.\n\nThat was a sign that the Eagles believe in Dean. And Dean believes in himself.\n\n\"Did I feel like I was ready (last season)?\" Dean said. \"Yeah. But at the same time, we was rolling as a team.\"\n\nThe QB battle to watch\n\nThe Eagles already know what they have in Hurts and backup QB Marcus Mariota. So it's quite possible that the OTAs will focus on the battle for the No. 3 job between returnee Ian Book and sixth-round pick Tanner McKee.\n\nBut there's more at stake in a typical No. 3 battle because of the new rule allowing teams to dress an emergency quarterback without having to use up a game-day roster spot.\n\nThe Eagles, like most teams, only dressed two QBs in the past, with someone like Greg Ward serving as an emergency QB (he was never needed).\n\nIn the past two years of OTAs, it became apparent that the QBs the Eagles signed as undrafted free agents − Carson Strong last year and Jamie Newman in 2021 − weren't ready. The stakes are higher for Book and McKee.\n\nSome other position battles to watch\n\nOn offense, there's one starting job up for grabs, and it's at right guard between Cam Jurgens, the Eagles' second-round pick in 2022, and Tyler Steen, the Eagles' third-round pick last month. One of them will replace Isaac Seumalo, who left as a free agent for Pittsburgh ... At safety, third-round pick Sydney Brown could battle for a starting job with Reed Blankenship, an undrafted rookie free agent who started five games last season when Chauncey Gardner-Johnson was injured. Gardner-Johnson and Marcus Epps both left in free agency. The Eagles signed veteran Terrell Edmunds as one starter, leaving the other spot open for Brown, Blankenship or veteran free agent Justin Evans.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

That number could grow to nine in Week 9, the Vikings set to start Jaren Hall and the Arizona Cardinals possibly rolling with fellow fifth-rounder Clayton Tune.\n\nAll told, a half-dozen clubs could be making lineup switches ... just since Week 8.\n\nPLAY TO WIN $5K: USA TODAY's Pro Football Survivor Pool is free to enter. Sign up now!\n\nThe usage of Plan B and Plan C QBs largely seems like a byproduct of the roster-building restrictions teams so often face in the three decades since the salary cap was instituted. When you pay established passers exorbitant salaries, there’s rarely much left over to also stock a capable veteran backup. Conversely, there’s ample room for a middle-class quarterback on the active roster … if you’ve got a promising youngster on a relatively cheap rookie deal, an arrangement many GMs favor – and won’t hesitate to reboot – given that permits you to invest more extensively in the supporting cast.\n\nBut when you’re counting on a player of Rodgers’ or even Cousins’ caliber, it usually becomes a fire drill if that guy goes down.\n\n\"I think there’s a lot of scenarios to that,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said Monday as his team reassessed its depth chart the day before the league’s trade deadline.\n\n\"What are the resources? I think the conversations that lead you down that road help clearly define the answer based upon, is it a short-term only thing? Is it something that could be more long term? Is it something that truly is an upgrade versus just the sheer dealing with the reality of a tough situation right now?\"\n\nThe Vikings, winners of an NFC-best three games in a row, tried to emerge from their rock and hard place Tuesday by acquiring veteran journeyman Joshua Dobbs from Arizona.\n\n\"Josh gives us an experienced player who's started some games, not only this year but last year, and has played some good football against some of the best defenses in our league,\" O'Connell said.\n\n\"He brings a level of athleticism to go with great football intelligence. He's a smart player, and I have always loved his makeup and what he's all about. He's played in a variety of offenses. I know he's excited to get going here.\"\n\nThough Dobbs might prove little more than a Band-Aid – and will likely be a bystander in Sunday’s matchup of Hall and newly promoted Taylor Heinicke in Atlanta – you might be surprised to learn other clubs are probably in far more precarious positions.\n\nHere’s a ranking, best to worst, of all 32 NFL teams’ backup quarterback circumstances:\n\n1. Carolina Panthers\n\nGood luck finding a better emergency fill-in than three-time Pro Bowler and 13-year vet Andy Dalton. He's 36 but was awfully good (95.2 passer rating) while starting 14 games for New Orleans in 2022. Including playoffs, Dalton has started 167 games and thrown for 247 TDs and nearly 40,000 yards during his career. Couldn’t ask for a better guy to mentor No. 1 pick Bryce Young, either. Jake Luton is in reserve on the practice squad.\n\n2. Detroit Lions\n\nIf something happens to Jared Goff, boy do they have alternatives. Now with his seventh team, former Pro Bowler Teddy Bridgewater is 33-32 during his 10-year career and has earned immediate respect in every locker room he’s graced. Seven-year vet Nate Sudfeld is also on the active roster but has never started in the NFL. David Blough, who has seven NFL starts (5 for Detroit) and shown ample moxie, is on the practice squad. Meanwhile, third-round rookie Hendon Hooker was in the Heisman Trophy discussion for the University of Tennessee last year before suffering a torn ACL in November. He’s been on the reserve/non-football injury list all year and seems likely to remain there into 2024.\n\n3. New Orleans Saints\n\nThe only team to carry four quarterbacks on its active roster, the Saints also enjoy a nice suite of capable options. Former Pro Bowler Jameis Winston has thrown for more than 5,000 yards and 30 TDs in a season … but has also served up 30 INTs. He’s only started 10 games since coming to New Orleans, which opted to go with Dalton for much of 2022, but he remains at the ready with plenty of experience and arm talent. Jack-of-all-trades Taysom Hill probably limits how much of the playbook is available when he's at the controls but has proven effective while executing a run-heavy offense that leverages his fullback tendencies. Rookie Jake Haener, an All-Mountain West performer for Fresno State last year, is back from his six-game PED suspension.\n\n4. Houston Texans\n\nThey’re in pretty good hands if hotshot rookie C.J. Stroud can't go. Old backup Case Keenum and young backup Davis Mills have a combined 90 starts, both playing quite well for extended stretches while displaying their boundaries when surrounded by suboptimal support.\n\n5. Dallas Cowboys\n\nCooper Rush has been remarkable, winning five of six starts with highly efficient performances in Dak Prescott’s stead since 2021. However he might have to do even more if his number is called this year given the regressive state of Dallas’ run game. Trey Lance, the No. 3 pick of the 2021 draft acquired in a preseason trade with San Francisco, is an intriguing project but hard to say if he’s ready to run HC Mike McCarthy’s system.\n\n6. Las Vegas Raiders\n\nWell, this is awkward. Newly anointed rookie starter Aidan O’Connell has highly experienced vets Jimmy Garoppolo and Brian Hoyer behind him. Both seem past their primes, though Jimmy G. might just be a poor fit in this offense and/or wasn’t utilized in a manner that maximized his limited physical prowess.\n\n7. Washington Commanders\n\nFew backstops are better than the respected and battle-tested (48 NFL starts) Jacoby Brissett. He’s never been able to get a team to the playoffs but can most definitely get hot for stretches and keep a team afloat for an extended run. Jake Fromm, who showed very little in two starts for the Giants in 2021, is a member of the practice squad.\n\n8. San Francisco 49ers\n\nThe thought of seeing Sam Darnold, the third overall draft pick just five years ago, finally get the chance to play in an offense with so many tools at his disposal is titillating – especially when you wonder what he might have done in place of banged-up Brock Purdy in recent weeks. Darnold’s ability has flashed plenty of times over the course of his 55 NFL starts … as has his unfortunate penchant to be careless with the ball. QB3 Brandon Allen, a seven-year veteran and Arkansas’ all-time leader for TD passes, has thrown 10 (vs. 6 INTs) over 15 NFL appearances, however accuracy (56.7% completion rate) has been a problem.\n\n9. Philadelphia Eagles\n\nDual-threat backup Marcus Mariota, the No. 2 pick of the 2015 draft, would theoretically allow the reigning NFC champs to retain much of their playbook if he had to step in for Jalen Hurts. Mariota has never really lived up to his draft billing but has been a solid performer for most of his career, which includes 13 starts in Atlanta last season. Teammates also gravitate to him. Rookie Tanner McKee is the third-stringer.\n\n10. New York Jets\n\nWe’ll consider Zach Wilson the backup here given Rodgers’ apparent determination to return this season from his Week 1 Achilles tear. Wilson has been serviceable, if inconsistent, through six 2023 starts – sufficient to keep the NYJ viable, if not what you’re hoping for from a player drafted second overall two years ago. The talent is occasionally obvious, as is Wilson’s still-untrustworthy decision making. Tim Boyle, who has experience with this offense from his time in Green Bay, is behind Wilson with NFL nomad Trevor Siemian and his 30 NFL starts (1 with the Jets in 2019) stashed on the practice squad.\n\n11. New York Giants\n\nThis season has been a microcosm of QB2 Tyrod Taylor’s 13-year career – effective when he’s on the field but prone to injuries that limit his availability. Rookie Tommy DeVito relieved injured Taylor in Week 8 and didn’t look NFL-ready … which is why longtime reserve Matt Barkley, who’s intimately familiar with HC Brian Daboll’s offense, was signed to the practice squad. Barkley may well be Daniel Jones’ backup Sunday in Las Vegas.\n\n12. Baltimore Ravens\n\nTyler Huntley received one of the more dubious Pro Bowl nods in recent memory last year but has generally done a nice job as a dual-threat replacement for Lamar Jackson the previous two seasons. Josh Johnson, 37, is also here as his apparent quest to play for every NFL team continues.\n\n13. Tennessee Titans\n\nInjured Ryan Tannehill is still listed atop the depth chart but, given he’s headed for free agency anyway, seems likely to give way permanently to rookie Will Levis. Malik Willis, a high-ceiling, low-floor third-rounder in 2022, continues to be a developmental project, though one unlikely to be completed in Nashville.\n\n14. Buffalo Bills\n\nKyle Allen has been a quietly effective player over the course of five NFL seasons, though hasn’t played a whole lot since his most recent starting opportunity with Washington in 2020. He better stay frosty given the frequent visits Josh Allen and his aching shoulder have been making to the medical tent. Following a two-year apprenticeship in Kansas City, Shane Buechele is in deep storage on the practice squad.\n\n15. Seattle Seahawks\n\nNo team is operating with such a precarious safety net. Drew Lock, who’s played in one regular-season game the past two seasons, is the only quarterback under contract not named Geno Smith. Lock did hit TE Noah Fant for a 51-yard completion in brief relief of Smith in Seattle’s Week 4 win against the Giants and has 21 uneven NFL starts on his résumé. A second-round pick for Denver and key component of the Russell Wilson trade, Lock clearly has ability and a big arm but might take some time to find a rhythm if he’s called on to play extensively.\n\n16. Miami Dolphins\n\nQB2 Mike White had some fabulous starts for the Jets in recent years … and some equally dreadful ones. That pattern has held in mop-up duty this year, White throwing two TD passes – one of the pick-six variety. QB3 Skylar Thompson’s numbers as a rookie in 2022 were nothing to crow about. But he does seem to be a gamer who makes plays and nearly engineered a wild-card upset at Buffalo starting in place of injured Tua Tagovailoa.\n\n17. Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nFormer Chicago Pro Bowler Mitch Trubisky hasn’t looked all that rehabilitated since coming to Pittsburgh in 2022, particularly in relief of Kenny Pickett in recent weeks. QB3 Mason Rudolph has been a solid fallback during 10 NFL starts but hasn’t seen the field during the regular season since 2021.\n\n18. Minnesota Vikings\n\nUnclear how this depth chart shakes out with Cousins now on injured reserve. This week’s acquisition of Dobbs suggests he’s likely to move into the lineup soon … unless Hall performs better than expected in his first start. Nick Mullens, who could be back from IR next week, and practice squader Sean Mannion have kicked around the league for years and combined for 20 starts (though Mullens owns all 5 wins). Lotta options here … but no guarantee any are good enough to sustain the Vikes’ playoff push.\n\n19. Atlanta Falcons\n\nA third-round pick last year, Desmond Ridder had started the team’s past 12 games, winning half of them, before getting demoted this week. His intangibles are off the charts … but so are the turnovers, an NFL-worst 12 this season. And the passing prowess just hasn’t been there despite the fact Ridder hasn’t been asked to carry this offense. QB3 Logan Woodside is well versed in this scheme, going back to his time with HC Arthur Smith when they were in Tennessee.\n\n20. Kansas City Chiefs\n\nIf greatness by osmosis is possible, Blaine Gabbert could be legendary. Now in his 12th season, he’s backed up Carson Palmer, Tom Brady and now Patrick Mahomes since transitioning from a starting role. Yet, unsurprisingly, Gabbert has barely played in the last five years, so hard to say what he’s bringing to the table. South Dakota State product Chris Oladokun is on the practice squad.\n\n21. Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nC.J. Beathard is the old hand, all of his 12 career starts occurring before he (and Trevor Lawrence) joined the Jags in 2021. Coming off a promising two-year hitch in the Canadian Football League, rookie Nathan Rourke also had some memorable moments in preseason.\n\n22. Denver Broncos\n\nNow on his third team, fifth-year backup Jarrett Stidham, whose first two NFL starts occurred for the post-Derek Carr Raiders last year, is behind Russell Wilson. Fresh off a successful XFL campaign, Ben DiNucci could push Stidham from the practice squad.\n\n23. Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nKyle Trask, a second-round pick in 2021, was a stud at Florida and looked solid in preseason despite losing the positional battle to Baker Mayfield. Still, Trask has all of nine regular-season passes to his credit. Former AAF star John Wolford, hardly a star during his sporadic NFL duties, was just called up to the 53-man roster.\n\n24. Cleveland Browns\n\nTheir quarterback room has pretty much been in constant flux since preseason given all the comings and goings and scrambling behind injured starter Deshaun Watson. Dorian Thompson-Robinson wasn’t ready for his first starting opportunity, though few rookies are going to shine when thrown into the crucible with Baltimore’s defense. P.J. Walker hasn’t been much better (1 TD, 5 INTs) while splitting two starts.\n\n25. Cincinnati Bengals\n\nDoes it say something about their faith in untested Jake Browning given Joe Burrow played through his obviously limiting calf injury early this season? Maybe … or maybe Burrow’s just too tough to leave the field. AJ McCarron, who’s on the practice squad, has thrown one NFL pass since the beginning of the 2020 season, though he was the starter for the XFL’s St. Louis Battlehawks earlier this year and led the league with 24 TD passes.\n\n26. Indianapolis Colts\n\nThey’d rank much higher if starter Gardner Minshew II was still No. 2. Unfortunately, with explosive rookie Anthony Richardson out the rest of the season following shoulder surgery, Minshew is QB1 – playing ahead of Sam Ehlinger and Kellen Mond (practice squad), neither doing much with their limited professional opportunities to date.\n\n27. Chicago Bears\n\nUndrafted rookie Tyson Bagent, with his Division II underdog background, is a really nice story. Remains to be seen how good an NFL quarterback he is. Bagent has completed 70% of his passes, but he’s not pushing the ball downfield and turned the ball over three times in last Sunday’s loss to the Chargers. Nathan Peterman has stuck in the league for seven seasons … and been almost unfailingly horrid whenever inserted into a lineup. Fifth-year vet Trace McSorley is on the practice squad but got some meaningful playing time for Arizona last season.\n\n28. New England Patriots\n\nHard to know what to make of this given how little conviction the Pats seem to have in the players behind struggling starter Mac Jones. Will Grier and Bailey Zappe are currently on the active roster with Malik Cunningham recently reverting to the practice squad. But that could change in the next five minutes given the musical chairs element to this situation.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals\n\nFluid scenario amid Dobbs’ departure and Murray’s imminent return from IR. Tune, selected out of the University of Houston (where he was a four-year starter), could get his shot Sunday to show he might have a long-term future holding a clipboard (or Surface as the case may be). Journeyman Jeff Driskel and his 11 NFL starts are presently on the practice squad.\n\n30. Los Angeles Rams\n\nFormer Mountain West star Brett Rypien hasn’t replicated his Boise State heroics in NFL spot duty but might get a fresh chance Sunday if Stafford’s injured thumb doesn’t allow him to play in Green Bay. Rookie Dresser Winn resides on the practice squad.\n\n31. Los Angeles Chargers\n\nEaston Stick is in his fifth season but has thrown all of one regular-season pass. Rookie Max Duggan is on the practice squad. Last year’s magic carpet ride at TCU spotlighted his remarkable leadership … and limitations as a passer.\n\n32. Green Bay Packers\n\nMuch as Jordan Love has struggled in recent weeks, infinitesimal chance he’s replaced by rookie Sean Clifford or Alex McGough, who have combined for zero regular-season passes in the NFL.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/draft/2023/04/29/nfl-draft-winners-losers-2023-patriots-packers-stetson-bennett/11769160002/", "title": "NFL draft 2023 winners, losers: Patriots make odd choices on Day 3", "text": "The stakes for Day 3 of the NFL draft typically don't compare to the first two nights of the event, but the final four rounds are hardly meaningless.\n\nThe final four rounds are an important avenue for teams to round out their rosters and take on long-term projects that can pay significant dividends. As this year's draft wrapped up Saturday, a few teams set themselves apart with shrewd decisions while others made some confusing calls. Similarly, some incoming rookies ended up in fortuitous situations while others could face a tough road ahead as they launch their professional careers.\n\nHere are the biggest winners and losers from Saturday's action.\n\nFIRST-ROUND WINNERS, LOSERS:Who aced Day 1?\n\nDAY 2 WINNERS, LOSERS:Lions rebound as 49ers puzzle\n\nPLAY TO WIN $5K: USA TODAY's Pro Football Survivor Pool is free to enter. Sign up now!\n\nWinners\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nReally, really good class from top to bottom for Chris Ballard in a critical year. While Anthony Richardson is obviously the centerpiece, the Colts continued to snag some promising pieces in the later rounds. On Saturday, fourth-round defensive tackle Aditomiwa Adebawore is a high-upside disruptor, while tight end Will Mallory and running back Evan Hull can help lighten Richardson's load in the passing game.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nSignal-callers were the story of the day, as a scramble for them resulted in nine being selected on Day 3. That's the number of quarterbacks who were chosen all of last year in what was a famously weak class at the position. The buy-in for developmental passers or expected backups was surprising given the uneven or uninspiring college careers that many had.\n\nGeorgia-Philadelphia Eagles connection\n\nPhiladelphia's affinity for defenders from the two-time college football champions went from meme to full-blown parody when Howie Roseman brought on his third Bulldog of the class with fourth-round cornerback Kelee Ringo. Then, for good measure, he swung a trade with the Detroit Lions for running back and former Georgia star D'Andre Swift. Given the trend, it's surprising Roseman didn't find a way to add safety Christopher Smith II and edge rusher Robert Beal, who both went in the fifth round. Eagles scouts should just park themselves in Athens next fall.\n\nD'Andre Swift\n\nBack to the running back: Perhaps no person had a more dramatic shift in fortune on Saturday than Swift. After the Lions surprised everyone by taking Alabama running back Jahmyr Gibbs to join David Montgomery in Detroit's backfield, Swift looked like the odd man out. Before the draft wrapped, however, the Philadelphia native was headed home. Swift will have to compete against Rashaad Penny, Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott for touches, but the defending NFC champions' ultra-effective ground game and support of a dominant offensive line bodes extremely well for the 24-year-old as he enters as contract year.\n\nStetson Bennett IV\n\nThe wins for former Georgia stars just keep piling up. Amid widespread speculation that he would be a late-round pick at best - and possibly go undrafted - the two-time national champion instead wound up as a fourth-round selection of the Los Angeles Rams. For a 5-11, 192-pound former walk-on, that draft status is a remarkable ascension. Bennett should stick around as Matthew Stafford's backup while getting coached up by Sean McVay - not a bad way for a launch his pro career.\n\nChandler Zavala\n\nWho doesn't love a good against-the-odds draft story? Zavala began his career as a 250-pound offensive lineman at Division II Fairmont State. Transferring to North Carolina State helped put him on a trajectory to become a fourth-round pick of the Carolina Panthers. Zavala will now be blocking for No. 1 pick Bryce Young while reuniting with former Wolfpack teammate Ikem Ekwonu, who is entering his second year as the Panthers' starting left tackle.\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nIt sure was an odd turn to see this franchise pivot from \"(expletive) those picks\" to \"grab those picks.\" The Rams left Day 3 with 11 new players, all of them pivotal in helping round out a top-heavy roster that was perilously thin in several spots last year. Among the potential early contributors are edge rusher Nick Hampton, wide receiver Puka Nakua and slot cornerback Tre'Vious Hodges-Tomlinson. Meanwhile, running back Zach Evans and edge rusher Ochaun Mathis provide some long-term upside.\n\nJoe Mixon\n\nHis once-shaky standing with the team now looks to be heading toward a smooth resolution. The Bengals did not end up drafting another running back - Illinois' Chase Brown - until Round 5. More important, Zac Taylor seemed to make a commitment that had not materialized until this point. \"His future is here with the team,\" Taylor told reporters in a news conference. \"I like Joe Mixon.\"\n\nDeuce Vaughn\n\nThere were plenty of family connections in this year's class, but this one might have been the best of them all. The Cowboys' sixth-round selection of the Kansas State running back created another link between Vaughn and his dad Chris, who is the Cowboys' college the assistant director of college scouting for Dallas. The move must have had both the 5-foot-5 ball carrier and his father feeling 10 feet tall.\n\nLosers\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nTaking a special teams player in the draft can be bold. Grabbing two is something else entirely. With fourth-rounder Chad Ryland and sixth-rounder Bryce Baringer, the Patriots became the first team since the then-Oakland Raiders in 2000 to take a kicker and a punter in the same draft. Sure, if Bill Belichick knew he were getting the equivalents of Sebastian Janikowski and Shane Lechler, the moves would be more palatable. But both players will need to be impeccable for these decisions to pay off. And Belichick's most recent kicker pick, 2020 fifth-rounder Justin Rohrwasser, was a whiff.\n\nNFL DRAFT GRADES:Eagles lead top team classes as Cowboys, Lions flop\n\nBEST UNDRAFTED FREE AGENTS:Ivan Pace Jr., Andre Carter II offer value\n\nDawand Jones\n\nSkipping out on the Senior Bowl after one day of practices might have cost Jones, as Sports Illustrated reported that the decision didn't sit well with some evaluators. The 6-8, 374-pound Jones ended a supersized draft wait into the fourth round. There's not an easy path to significant playing time here, with 28-year-old right tackle Jack Conklin having signed an extension last December that keeps him under contract through 2026. At least Jones lands with one of the league's best offensive line coaches in Bill Callahan.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nA class that was underwhelming across the board wrapped up with 10 picks in the final four rounds. Adding that many end-of-roster players to an already young team feels like a miscalculation. At least GM Trent Baalke landed an additional fourth-round pick next year as part of his maneuvering.\n\nTanner McKee\n\nWhen Fresno State's Jake Haener became the first quarterback to hear his name called Saturday, it seemed like McKee might not be far off from learning his landing spot. Instead, the Stanford product would up being the eighth quarterback chosen on Saturday, not coming off the board until the sixth round to the Eagles. While learning from new offensive coordinator Brian Johnson could aid his long-term growth, he might be stuck as a developmental option for the foreseeable future with Jalen Hurts entrenched as the starter and Marcus Mariota serving as the backup. Maybe the 6-6, 231-pound passer would have been better off hitting the transfer portal rather than declaring.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nIt's fully understandable that the Packers would want to bring aboard a backup quarterback as they hand the starting reins to Jordan Love. Turning to Penn State's Sean Clifford in the fifth round, however, is bizarre. The 6-2, 211-pounder didn't show enough in four years as a starter to suggest he could see meaningful playing time, and the 24-year-old – who is more than three months older than Love – isn't a particularly tantalizing developmental prospect. GM Brian Gutekunst said the team plans to bring in another quarterback, and it seems like a veteran will be necessary.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2024/02/26/6-eagles-nfl-combine-goals-aj-brown-free-agents-draft-kevin-byard-bradberry-howie-roseman-kelce/72714348007/", "title": "6 Eagles NFL Combine goals include AJ Brown, free agents, draft ...", "text": "There is always more on the Eagles' agenda than just testing and interviewing potential draftees at the NFL scouting combine this week in Indianapolis.\n\nSure, the potential draftees are a big component of the five-day extravaganza that begins Wednesday and features 319 of the top college players eligible for the 2024 draft.\n\nThat's certainly the case for the Eagles, who have four picks in the top 100 − No. 22 in the first round, two second-round picks (Nos. 50 and 53), and a third-round compensatory pick (somewhere between No. 96-100).\n\nBut the draft isn't the only way that the Eagles can address a defense that was among the worst in the NFL. There's free agency that begins in two weeks, and Eagles general manager Howie Roseman is among the most active GMs in trades. In fact, Roseman has even swung deals at the combine in the past.\n\nHere, then, are 6 objectives for Roseman and staff at the combine:\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nKELCE DECISION:Is Jason Kelce retirement decision coming soon? How it affects Eagles' entire offseason\n\nDONTE'S PEAK?'Extra sweet': Donte DiVincenzo shows 76ers what they're missing without Joel Embiid\n\n1. Find out Jason Kelce's retirement decision\n\nIt's expected that center Jason Kelce will decide whether he's retiring or not before the start of the new league year on March 13. If he returns for another season, then the Eagles can address other positions, although they'll have to sign Kelce to a contract.\n\nThen again, that shouldn't be much of an issue now that the NFL salary cap was set at $255 million, a record-setting increase of $30 million compared to the cap in 2023.\n\nIf Kelce decides to retire, then the Eagles will likely move Cam Jurgens from right guard to center. Can Tyler Steen, the Eagles' third-round pick last spring, then slide into Jurgens' spot at right guard? Or will the Eagles have to find a free agent? Or re-sign either Sua Opeta or Jack Driscoll, both of whom are eligible for free agency?\n\nIt would seem like a draftee wouldn't be the answer if Kelce retires unless he's ready to play right away.\n\nDoes AJ Brown have a Jalen Hurts problem?\n\nEagles wide receiver A.J. Brown called into SportsRadio 94 WIP last week to refute talk-radio scuttlebutt (mostly from WIP) that he's unhappy. He said he wanted “to clear up some BS,” that he is happy, and he wants to stay in Philadelphia, and his relationship with quarterback Jalen Hurts is great, and that he's not a diva like Terrell Owens.\n\n\"That's the reason I'm on the show,\" he said during his call. \"I'm the person who stands up to the bully.\"\n\nGreat. But Roseman, head coach Nick Sirianni, and/or new offensive coordinator Kellen Moore all should make it a point to check in with Brown if they haven't already.\n\nAfter all, Moore will be calling a new offense. And the Eagles have other receivers who want and deserve the ball in DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert. It's also possible that the Eagles will draft one or more receivers to serve as a third WR.\n\nWe saw a few instances last season where Brown was on the sideline in heated exchanges with coaches and teammates. Sure, Brown is dynamic as his two 1,400-yard receiving seasons have proven − as long as he's happy.\n\nAnd it's certainly looking like the Eagles will have to make sure that Brown is happy (read: getting lots of targets) in Moore's offense.\n\nBrown says he’s happy now. But the Eagles have seen what can happen when a marquee receiver isn’t happy. Just ask the receiver that Brown says he’s not like.\n\nDelve into Haason Reddick trade possibilities\n\nThe Eagles have reportedly indicated that they're willing to move on from their sacks leader in Haason Reddick, who has 27 in two seasons in Philly. Reddick enters the season with the largest salary cap hit on the team at $21.9 million, and the Eagles could potentially save $16 million on the cap with a trade or release with a post-June 1 designation.\n\nSure, the Eagles could give Reddick a contract extension. But he'll turn 30 in September, and he's going to want a raise. Is it better for the Eagles to pay Reddick well into his 30s, or move on and signing a younger free agent (Chase Young?) for that kind of money or less?\n\nSo finding a trade partner would be ideal.\n\nHow Eagles can replace Kevin Byard, James Bradberry\n\nIt's a no-brainer for the Eagles to release safety Kevin Byard because it allows them to save $13 million on the cap. But it also makes sense to release cornerback James Bradberry with a post-June 1 designation after a disappointing season.\n\nBoth are in their 30s. But they still have to be replaced.\n\nThe Eagles' history has shown that they won't find those players with an early-round draft pick. The Eagles haven't used a first-round pick on a cornerback since 2002, or a pick in the top three rounds since 2017. The Eagles have never drafted a safety in the first round, and they haven't taken one in the second round since 2011.\n\nSo the Eagles will certainly look at the free agent route at one or both positions. The Eagles currently are $27 million under the cap, and can get to the $40 million range. But as of now, there are 16 teams with more cap space.\n\nMore than just top free agents getting free\n\nThe Eagles have found success anticipating players who become available later in free agency, perhaps into April or May. That's how they got Bradberry in 2022. But there are also top players who surprisingly become available as salary cap casualties.\n\nThe Dolphins, for example, told star corner Xavien Howard that they'll be releasing him when the new league year starts. The Buffalo Bills are a projected $45 million over the cap (cornerback Tre'Davious White, anyone?), and the Saints and Chargers are in that ballpark too.\n\nAs for Howard, if he's still available after the so-called first wave, would he be willing to reunite with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who was the Dolphins' DC last season?\n\nIf not, surely other starting-caliber players could shake free in April or May, after other teams have already spent their money.\n\nStart working on a potentially wild draft strategy\n\nAll of that, of course, leads us to the main purpose of the combine − finding players to draft. While the Eagles have so many needs on defense, it would also behoove them to look into drafting players on offense in the first round.\n\nFor example, if the Eagles can address their defensive needs in free agency, then perhaps there's a running back in Rounds 2 or 3 who can replace D'Andre Swift if Swift leaves in free agency; or a third wide receiver in the first three rounds.\n\nHeck, the Eagles could possibly find a backup quarterback in the first three rounds instead of paying for a veteran − unless they're convinced Tanner McKee, their sixth-round pick last year, can do it.\n\nAll of those plans are put into play beginning this week in Indianapolis.\n\nContact Martin Frank @mfrank@delawareonline.com.

It did not respond to requests for comment, and Middletown is not included on its public list of upcoming locations. Large businesses like Target typically prefer to remain anonymous until a lease is signed and construction plans are approved.\n\nThe Middletown Planning Commission last week recommended the Town Council approve 147,613 square feet of retail space for what planning documents refer to as Northside shopping center. The final step in the approval process is a vote by the Town Council, which Branner said is scheduled for Sept. 12.\n\nThe exact location of the Target is unclear.

Chris Robbins, the owner of the shopping center, said his conversations with Target began more than a year prior.\n\nThe Dover Target has been closed since early July after a man started a fire in the linen section of the store \"as a diversion to steal a cart full of merchandise,\" according to Dover police.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

It is a standalone building with a drive-thru near the WSFS building on the south end of The Grove.\n\nThe chain has been expanding rapidly, having added more than 500 locations in the last decade. Its restaurants make essentially one item: chicken fingers.\n\nMost of the menu items are different-sized combo meals with fingers, crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw and the company's signature Cane's sauce. The only deviation is the chicken sandwich, which is three chicken fingers on a bun. The tenders are hand-dipped to order.\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes brings specialty bakery to Christiana\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes, a national chain of bundt cake-only bakeries, is expanding to a second Delaware location.\n\nDelaware's first Nothing Bundt Cakes opened in December in the Market Square shopping center bordering Brandywine Town Center on Concord Pike. The second is being built in the Churchmans Place strip center on Churchmans Road in Christiana.\n\nConstruction began earlier this month. Franchisee Patrycja Swan is hopeful it will open this summer.\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes offers 10 bundt cake flavors and a rotating specialty flavor in five sizes, ranging from a tiered cake to mini \"bundtinis.\" Shoppers can select from a variety of decorations.

Patrycja was looking for a new challenge after being a stay-at-home mother.\n\nIn 2018, they opened their first location in Exton, Pennsylvania. The Concord Pike location opened in December after a few months of equipment delays.\n\nAs for more Nothing Bundt Cakes in Delaware, Swan said, \"I think I've got my hands full with three.\"\n\n\"It's like with kids they say three under three. I've got two under one,\" Swan said. \"It's like having twins almost.\"\n\nConstruction begins at Crumbl Cookies in Christiana Fashion Center\n\nWork recently began on the Crumbl Cookies in the Christiana Fashion Center.\n\nThe store did not return a request for comment this week. The company previously said it is projected to open \"this spring.\"\n\nCrumbl Cookies features a rotating menu of six varieties: a chocolate chip and five more unique flavors pulled from a back catalog of recipes or developed fresh.

It's often referred to as the Samuel Henry Black house, for its owner who was a doctor and farmer in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nA Taco Bell spokesperson said Wednesday the company is planning to open \"within the next two weeks.\"\n\nOther tenants for the center include AutoZone and ChristianaCare GoHealth Urgent Care.\n\nWaffle House opens doors in Bear\n\nA Waffle House opened earlier this month on Route 40 in Bear.\n\nThe restaurant took the place of a medical office at 1450 Pulaski Highway.

At 113,000 square feet, it is the smallest of Target's four Delaware stores, but larger than most of Target's urban small-format stores.\n\nTarget will be on the first floor of the Sears building. A vacancy for a second business on the second floor is being advertised. Deborah Mills Houston of Robbins Property Management said the company has \"explored a number of different ideas\" for the second-floor space, but has not finalized any deals.\n\nThere is an atrium to the left of the Target entrance with an escalator and an elevator to the second floor of the building. The open space is advertised as being up to 66,720 square feet.\n\nSears opened on Kirkwood Highway in 1963. It closed in 2018 in one of several waves of closures by the company in the 2010s as it nosedived toward bankruptcy. Delaware's last Sears in the Concord Mall on Route 202 closed in February 2020.\n\nParking\n\nThere is a total of more than 1,500 parking spaces located in front of and behind the store. To access Target from the back parking lot, there is a stairwell to a walkway between Gabe's and the atrium connected to Target.\n\nHouston said the shopping center did not need any parking variances to support the Target.\n\nBy comparison, the Brandywine Town Center that includes a larger Target, Lowes and several other large box stores has more than 5,000 parking spaces.\n\nWhat else is coming to the shopping center?\n\nWith Target as the anchor, the shopping center has attracted several new tenants.\n\nThose coming soon include Tropical Smoothie, Two Claws, Urban Kitchen, Chick-fil-A and Chase Bank.\n\nChick-fil-A and Chase Bank will fill two new pad sites being built in place of the Sears Auto Center near the road. Houston said she expects them to open in late summer. The others are taking existing in-line space.\n\nThe shopping center has at least three additional vacancies.\n\nOnce Upon A Child and AutoZone are also recent additions to the shopping center. Last year, Robbins renovated the entire facade of the shopping center shifting it from a beige and brown color to dark gray.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

Both concepts come from Triple T Hospitality Group, a restaurant group with roughly a dozen locations mostly in New Jersey.\n\nTommy's Tavern + Tap will take over the former JB Dawson's between Macy's and Nordstrom on the west side of the mall, and Tio Taco + Tequila Bar will take over the former California Pizza Kitchen next door.\n\nTriple T describes Tommy's Tavern + Tap as a \"rustic, industrial tavern and restaurant.\" The menus for its existing locations include a variety of sandwiches, burgers and salads as well as coal-fired pizza and sushi. Tommy's also has an extensive draft beer list.\n\nTio Taco + Tequila Bar pairs a \"exciting, casual-sophisticated atmosphere\" with craft cocktails, a variety of tequilas and foods like homemade guacamole.\n\nJB Dawson's and California Pizza Kitchen were among a handful of restaurants added around the exterior of the mall as part of renovations around a decade ago. They closed amid the pandemic.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

More locations could follow as the company looks to almost double in size over the next three years.\n\nThe planned site is at 601 S. Ridge Ave. near the Westown Kohl's off Middletown Warwick Road. A development plan is making its way through Middletown's approval process having gone to the Planning & Zoning Commission in mid-May before a final Town Council hearing.\n\n\"The family-friendly atmosphere and strong community ties in Middletown felt like a perfect fit for Freddy’s,\" Freddy's Assistant Public Relations Manager Kim Huynh said in a statement.\n\nFreddy's uses a franchise system. The Delaware territory is owned by JRI Hospitality, the company's largest franchisee and one of its earliest. President and CEO Jason Ingermanson said he is aiming to open the Middletown restaurant by the end of next year.\n\nIngermanson said he will evaluate other locations in Delaware once his group can use the results of the Middletown store to develop criteria for the market. JRI Hospitality owns and operates almost 80 Freddy's locations, including the Freddy's nearest to Delaware in Exton, West Chester, Broomall and Brookhaven, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We have a lot more in the pipeline,\" Ingermanson said.\n\nFreddy's signature is its pressed thin and crispy-edged steakburgers cooked to order. The burgers are served with shoestring fries and a special fry sauce. The seasoning blend used on the burgers and fries is also available on the side.\n\nFreddy's also offers patty melts, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken tenders, onion rings and cheese curds. The desert menu features frozen custard, milkshakes, floats and turtle sundaes.\n\nFreddy's was founded in 2002 by brothers Bill and Randy Simon and named for their father. It slowly expanded across the Midwest and now has a presence in the Southeast, the Southwest and Texas. The deepest into the Northeast it's gone is northern New Jersey.\n\nIn 2020, Freddy Simon died at the age of 95. Thompson Street Capital Partner purchased the chain the following year and installed a new CEO, Chris Dull. In an interview in February with Nation's Restaurant News, Dull said Freddy's will have more than 800 locations by 2026 and has the potential to hit a store count above 3,000.\n\nThe company, still based in Wichita, has about 460 restaurants today across 36 states. In the last two years, franchisees have been awarded about 240 stores.\n\nMIDDLETOWN EATS:Rehoboth favorite Taco Reho is bringing its flavor to Middletown at former Steak 'n Shake\n\nFreddy's fills a niche in Middletown for a fast casual burger above the grade of a McDonald's or Burger King, a void opened recently by Steak 'n Shake. Freddy's will face competition in Middletown in the quick service realm from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, Panda Express and Panera Bread, among others.\n\nSimilar \"better burger\" chains operating elsewhere in Delaware include Five Guys, Shake Shack and Wayback Burgers.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

Within those departments, the company is known for stocking items not typically seen in the area, including dragon fruit, rambutan and cactus leaves.\n\nProduce Junction operates 19 locations across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware from its shipping warehouse and headquarters in Swedesboro, New Jersey.

Main St., which places it where the Staples is located between Old Navy and Bed, Bath & Beyond. Through a spokesperson, Grammer declined to comment further.\n\nAllied Properties, which operates Christiana Town Center, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOnline marketing materials show the 20,000-square-foot space occupied by Staples is \"at lease.\"\n\nAldi will be the first grocery store in the Christiana Town Center. The shopping center has been near full capacity since Urban Air Adventure Park filled most of the expansion near the back of the property in December.\n\nThe shopping center also features Boscovs, Planet Fitness and Five Below, among other businesses.\n\nIn January, Aldi announced it will open its first Sussex County store in the former Kmart building off Coastal Highway. The company has not provided a timetable for when the store will open. There are six Aldi stores in Delaware.\n\nTRADER JOE'S: A look inside Delaware's second Trader Joe's\n\nLidl in Bear appears almost ready\n\nThe new Lidl at Pulaski Highway and Salem Church Road in Bear appears near completion. Lidl spokesperson Chandler Ebeier did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, the company included the Bear location in a list of 50 U.S. stores expected to open by the end of 2021. Lidl is taking the place of Countryside Nursery and Garden Center.\n\nLidl, like its German counterpart Aldi, bills itself as a low-priced, high-quality alternative to traditional \"cookie-cutter\" grocery stores.\n\nAround 90% of Lidl's products are produced by its own private-label brands. The store's offerings are more limited than traditional grocery stores and are displayed in the boxes they were shipped in, rather than being stocked on shelves by employees.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

Police have used the technology for investigations, and advanced models allow authorities to view location information, text messages, numbers called, emails and stored photos.\n\nThe filing is in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Newark resident Jonathan Rudenberg against the Delaware Department of Justice.\n\nThe department in 2015 denied a request by Rudenberg, who asked the state police through the Freedom of Information Act to disclose how Stingray technology is being used and what's been purchased. The denial was challenged to Attorney General Matt Denn, who ruled in December that state police didn't have to disclose certain details, prompting the lawsuit.\n\nPolice secretly track cellphones to solve routine crimes\n\nThe federal Department of Justice's filing with the court last week said the agency wanted its voice heard because any decision could hamper investigations.\n\n\"Although the United States is not a party to this case, it has a direct interest in the protection of the information withheld,\" Justice Department attorneys wrote. \"Cell-site simulator technology is a key tool in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation, interdiction and suppression of criminal and terrorist activity. Disclosure of even minor details about this technology will jeopardize, if not vitiate, the ability of the FBI and the larger law enforcement community to successfully deploy this valuable technology.\"\n\nThe News Journal in February reported about state police using the technology, which was originally developed for federal agents and the military. Authorities declined a request to comment before the story, but after the article, police in a statement said the devices are used to locate criminal suspects and missing persons only, and officers do not read electronic communications, such as emails or text messages.\n\nACLU prepared to go to court to learn more about Stingray, a cellphone surveillance technology used by the Delaware State Police to intercept the location of a phone, view calls lists and text messages from nearby cellphones.\n\nState police also denied a FOIA request from The News Journal that requested details about the use of Stingrays by police.\n\nAfter consulting with the FBI, the agency provided redacted purchase orders to The News Journal and Rudenberg, who was quoted in stories about the technology.\n\nSpecific Stingray models were blacked out from the disclosed documents. The records show state police paid $949,704 to Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla., for hardware and training between 2008 and 2014.\n\nWhile the very nature of police investigations is secretive, cell-site simulators have an extra layer of mystery because the state police, like other law enforcement agencies, signed an agreement with the FBI promising it would disclose virtually no information about the machines, and are directed to dismiss criminal cases if details about the tools are threatened to be released.\n\nA USA TODAY Network investigation identified more than 35 police departments that used Stingrays in 2013 and 2014, and the ACLU has found at least 18 more. When and how the police have used those devices is mostly a mystery, largely because of the FBI's secrecy oath.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2016/07/12/leaders-troubled-african-countries-see-similar-problems-delaware/86620724/", "title": "African visitors see similarities between home, Delaware", "text": "Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe problems facing Alveno Soares' small African country aren't so different from the ones troubling parts of Delaware.\n\nDrugs, high dropout rates, teen pregnancy and unemployment are the primary issues that he battles through the nonprofit Centro Juvenil Nho Djunga. They may be more pronounced in his home country of Cabo Verde -- an island nation in the Atlantic Ocean about 350 miles west of Senegal -- than they are here, but they persist in pockets of poverty across Delaware.\n\nSoares, 30, is one of 25 young people from Africa on the University of Delaware's campus this the summer as part of the Mandela Washington Fellowship. It's the flagship program of President Barack Obama's Young African Leaders Initiative, which gives promising young people between the ages of 25 and 35 from sub-Saharan African countries an opportunity to spend time at American universities to train and network. The program has 1,000 fellows this year.\n\nThe program also pairs fellows with organizations in the community they are visiting that work on issues similar to what they focus on in their home countries.\n\nSoares is working with One Village Alliance, an organization that mentors students from some of Wilmington's roughest neighborhoods. It is based in the city's Eastside, which has suffered from deeply entrenched poverty, drug addiction and high incarceration rates for decades. Soares met with the organization in his first week in the United States and toured the neighborhood. He said it didn't look terribly different than his own country.\n\n\"In a country like this, with so much power,\" Soares said, letting his voice trail off and pointing toward Wilmington, \"but you have a ghetto like this, like my country, and we're a poor country.\"\n\nCabo Verde's gross domestic product was $1.6 billion in 2015, according to The World Bank; the U.S.'s was $17.95 trillion.\n\n\"The world is so small,\" he said, noting that people across the globe suffer from the same problems and have the same hopes. \"We do the same things,\" he said. \"We have the same goals.\"\n\nSoares has spent 12 years as a social and environmental activist, working mostly with youth. He has the students he works with do what he calls a \"battle of photography,\" where they go out into their communities to take pictures of both the good parts and the bad parts, then come together and present three of each and talk about what makes them good or bad.\n\nHe wants to do that here, too.\n\n\"Show me Delaware,\" Soares said, \"the good side and the bad side.\"\n\nKelly Kapianga, 26, works as a corporate lawyer in Zambia -- a landlocked country of more than 14 million people in southern Africa -- and volunteers with an organization called the Undikumbukire Project, which represents juveniles who are imprisoned there. Undikumbukire means \"remember me.\"\n\nHe sees all kinds of cases – drugs, armed robberies, murders, immigration – and, Kapianga said, \"one thing we see all the time is that they (youth) cannot deal with the criminal justice system.\"\n\nNinety-five percent of kids in Zambia are left to represent themselves, he said.\n\nThe country has only 1,300 lawyers, he said, to serve a population of over 16 million. That's one lawyer for every 12,461 people. In the U.S., there is one lawyer for every 244 people, based on the most recent figures from the American Bar Association.\n\nFurther compounding that problem, he said, is that most lawyers in Zambia specialize in corporate law since that's where the money is. There are no public interest law firms.\n\nKapianga has been paired with the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, which operates nationally to shape laws that benefit young people.\n\nIts model is interesting, Kapianga said, and strategic. The law center takes on cases that will have the most impact – those that will break new ground or forge changes in existing law.\n\nIt would be hard to pick just one out of hundreds of cases, said Kapianga, who also coaches volleyball at a Zambia prison.\n\nThe problem with coaching, he said, is that \"you get emotionally attached,\" it would be nearly impossible to choose just one case. He's eager to learn from the law center, though, and bring that knowledge back to Zambia.\n\nJust a little north of where Kapianga is working on juvenile criminal law, Shamillah Namakula, 26, is a human rights activist who has built a program with her mother to teach people about efficient agriculture in Uganda -- in central east Africa, just west of Kenya.\n\nThey have about four acres of land with a water source in a rural part of the country and let local families use it. They started with six families and this year doubled it to 12.\n\nOnce a month, Namakula puts together a presentation about agricultural practices and has a get-together with families.\n\n\"In African cultures, we love to eat,\" she said. \"When it comes to teaching something, it's best to do it over a meal.\"\n\nSo, that's what they do – prepare a meal and host the farming families to give their presentation.\n\nThe land is about 45 minutes outside of Uganda's capital, Kampala, in a poor town where the average size of a family is six people, usually living in a two-room shack, Namakula said.\n\nChildren often don't go to school because they have to help their families make money, she said.\n\n\"They should be in school, but they're making bricks and farming sheep,\" she said.\n\nA lot of the families in the area have land, she said, they just don't know how to use it efficiently. She hopes to fix that.\n\nFatouma Youssouf Elmi, 30, works to stop domestic violence with the National Union of Djiboutian Women. Djibouti is a small country on the East Africa coast that sits just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen.\n\nWhen she was 18, her cousin was beaten to death by her husband, Elmi said. That's what brought her to this work.\n\n\"She was very close to me,\" Elmi said.\n\nIn the years since, Elmi has done extensive work with women and children who face sexual violence as refugees and with women who face abuse at home.\n\n\"I want to work beside women,\" she said, with a red polka dot scarf tied around her head.\n\n\"Violence will destroy everything,\" Elmi said. \"So, I'm passionate to do my work.\"\n\nContact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909 or sspencer@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2015/11/10/deep-blue-restaurant-closes-renovations-concept-changes-modern-steakhouse-reopening-set-dec/75515286/", "title": "Deep Blue eatery becoming 'a modern steakhouse'", "text": "Patricia Talorico\n\nThe News Journal\n\nDeep Blue Bar and Grill, the seafood restaurant that’s been a part of the downtown Wilmington dining scene since 1998, closed Monday for retooling.\n\nOwner Dan Butler says he is changing the name and concept and is extensively renovating the West 11th Street restaurant. He says he anticipates reopening the eatery Dec. 1 with a new look, feel and focus.\n\n“It will be predominately a steakhouse atmosphere,” Butler says, adding the menu will change significantly. “It will be billed as a modern steakhouse.”\n\nButler also plans to expand the bar area with “more soft seating and a lot of TVs. We will have a lot of promotions around sporting events. It will appeal more to casual dining. It’s not a sports bar, but it will be a great restaurant bar. It will feel like a new space.”\n\nThe dining room will be expanded – Butler has taken over 1,000 square feet of space next to the restaurant that had been a hairstyling salon – and he says there will be more private dining available for groups from 10 to 60 people.\n\nThe restaurant’s new name has not yet been decided, he says. “We’re not ready to make the confirmation. We’re waiting to see the baby before we name it,” Butler joked. “A name is a personal thing. We want to make sure we have it right before we present it to the public.”\n\nDeep Blue was a hit with fine-dining seafood lovers when it began service more than 16 years ago. Chefs over the years have included Robert Lhulier, who recently left the University & Whist Club, and former Wilmington restaurateur Julio Lazzarini who now owns a Rhode Island restaurant.\n\nBut, Butler says the dining scene has shifted, especially downtown, in recent years. “It’s more, more and more casual. It’s not a trend I love, but it’s a trend I recognize.” He says even though 10 blocks separate Deep Blue from Toscana, Butler’s flagship Trolley Square Italian restaurant, the clientele are very different.\n\n“Toscana is much more of a neighborhood restaurant and Deep Blue is more for the business community and business travelers,” he says.\n\nChanges are not unusual for Butler, who has overhauled Toscana restaurant several times since opening the eatery in 1991. He also owns Brandywine Prime Seafood & Chops in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, which features a large steakhouse menu.\n\nButler says he and his business partner Paul Bouchard, who manages Deep Blue, began shifting away from seafood about two years by introducing a steakhouse section of the menu. “We based it on what we learned at Brandywine Prime.”\n\nButler says the steakhouse menu “killed it. It really opened our eyes. That’s what people are telling us what they want. As much as I love seafood, there are people in this world who just don’t eat fish. In downtown Wilmington, we can’t afford to exclude anyone.”\n\nThe bar will offer cocktails, wine and at least 16 craft beers on tap – “beer is where wine was 15 years ago,” Butler says - and it will have a separate, more casual menu with offerings like gourmet burgers. Butler says the main dining room menu is still being crafted with the help of Deep Blue executive chef Pat Bradley and will still have some seafood, along with pasta dishes.\n\nDespite reports of growing crime in the city, Butler says he is committed to remaining a part of the downtown Wilmington business community.\n\n“Downtown is safe,” says Butler, a Wilmington native. “And my neck of the woods in downtown is particularly safe. If more people come downtown then more people would come downtown. The city of Wilmington has been tremendously supportive of my efforts. I want to be part of the solution how we generate more people downtown.”\n\nNewark chef + Guy Fieri Sunday on Food Network\n\nDon’t forget to tune into the Food Network on Sunday night at 8 to see Newark chef Robbie Jester compete on “Guy’s Grocery Games.”\n\nJester, executive chef of Stone Balloon Ale House on Main Street, filmed the culinary competition show, hosted by chef/restaurateur Guy Fieri, back in February. Jester says the program, now in its sixth season, will have a Thanksgiving theme.\n\nDuring each episode, the spiky-haired Fieri challenges four contestants to run through the show’s grocery store set to shop for items so they can cook a dish. Along the way, he throws challenges at them, such as finding substitutions for “out-of-stock” ingredients, cooking with five items or less, or making a dish on a $10 budget.\n\nThe contestants dishes are tasted and evaluated by three judges.\n\nJester found out last December he earned a spot on the Food Network game show, filmed in California, after going through a series of interviews with casting directors and producers. It’s his first time appearing on national TV.\n\nJester couldn’t reveal many details of the show, due to contractual obligations, but did say that he talks about his father Bob, a former restaurateur owner, who is battling cancer.\n\nA viewing party will be held Sunday at the Stone Balloon Ale House, 115 E. Main St., for anyone who wants to cheer on Jester.\n\nThe last dining room seating will be at 6 p.m. and the kitchen will close at 7:30 p.m. Light snacks will be available during the show and the bar will be open.

Christiansen, the Dover City Council and the hiring committee have faith in me,\" Mailey said. \"I know we have a lot of work to do, but I am ready to take on this challenge.”\n\nMailey's appointment was made necessary because of the retirement of Chief Paul Bernat, who announced his departure on Dec. 20 and officially stepped down in mid-January. After Bernat's announced retirement, Christiansen was adamant on following the process that the Dover City Council put in place.\n\nA committee was formed and accepted 34 applications from across the country. Six individuals were interviewed – five face-to-face and one by Skype – and by a majority vote of the committee, Mailey prevailed.\n\nThe mayor made it clear during a press conference in January that he would follow the process to pick a new chief that was set in place in June 2015 – due in part to the debacle that occurred when Bernat was appointed Dover’s 13th police chief in April 2014.\n\nSTORY: Slain trooper's mother said her son loved Delaware\n\nSTORY: I-95N to close for processions to trooper's service\n\nAt the time, the police chief was directly appointed by the mayor without any input from council or staff.

The new process also eliminates the requirement to promote from within.\n\n“I am pleased that we have come to the end of the process that we followed in good faith and were able to agree that Deputy Chief Marvin Mailey will make an outstanding chief and continue to lead Dover in the right direction,\" Christiansen said. \"I look forward to swearing him in as Dover’s 14th police chief.”\n\nMailey hails from New York and came to Delaware in 1989, when he began working as a correctional officer, according to the Dover Police Department. Mailey is a 1993 graduate of the Dover Police Academy and has been with Dover Police Department for almost 24 years.\n\nA press conference to officially announce Mailey as Dover's new chief will be held at 9 a.m. on Tuesday in the Dover City Council Chambers, at 15 Loockerman Plaza.\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com. follow him on Twitter at @Jerry SmithTNJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/21/skate-park-looking-more-like-reality-wilmington/92508224/", "title": "$1 million Wilmington skate park plan advances", "text": "Karl Baker\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe transformation of a concrete lot into a skate park under Interstate 95 in Wilmington is moving forward after more than a decade of discussion, but residents will have at least one more chance to express opinions to state officials.\n\nThe News Journal last year reported about the plan to build the $1 million state-of-the-art skate park on the vacant lot where grass and weeds grow on Liberty Street underneath I-95. Plans call for the 18,000-square-foot park to be developed by the city and Wilmington Skate Project, a nonprofit organization formed to create free skateboarding facilities.\n\nPlans call for various inclines, rails and obstacles for skateboarders and other wheeled outdoor enthusiasts to enjoy. The project has been in the works for 16 years.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation is scheduled to hold a public hearing about the proposed $1, 25-year lease of the vacant lot to the city. The meeting is 1-2 p.m. Nov. 1 in the Brandywine Room of the Delaware Transit Corp. facility at 119 Lower Beech St. in Wilmington.\n\nThe park was the brainchild of former city Councilman Kevin Kelley, said DelDOT spokesman and city Councilman Bud Freel.\n\nA skate park can improve the aesthetic of area around I-95 and the health of city residents, said Kelley, who ran for mayor of Wilmington this year and lost in the September primary. It also can attract people from a cross-section of the city, he said.\n\n\"It's a multi-demographic sport,\" he said. \"And if you look at skateboarders, the majority are in good physical shape.\"\n\nSTORY: Former Fisker site to hit sales block\n\nSTORY: Wilmington settles police contract, approves raises\n\nAt the request of Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington South, state lawmakers in 2014 appropriated $450,000 for the project. As violent crime has persisted at high levels in Wilmington during the past year, residents have called for more city parks tailored to the interests of young people.

Richard D. Bratz, a state police spokesman. Police say Dean implied to the teller that he was armed, but didn't show a weapon.\n\nOnce the bank teller complied with Dean's demands, police say he fled in an unknown direction.\n\nNo one was injured during the incident.\n\nA short time later, troopers searching the area observed Dean trying to board a bus on East Chestnut Hill Road (Del. 4) in the area of South Kingston Drive.

He had been a lifeguard for 34 years and captain for 21.\n\n“I hated to leave. I didn’t want to leave,” he said. “But the patrol that I know, that I’ve been involved with for 20 years as captain, has been taken away from me. I just felt it was the right time to stand up.”\n\nBuckson’s discontent began in late April, when the beaches were still closed.\n\nRehoboth Beach City Manager Sharon Lynn approved the hiring of a handful of lifeguards to assist police with enforcing COVID-19 restrictions. She delegated supervision of the beach patrol to Rehoboth Beach Police Chief Keith Banks.\n\nIt was the first time Buckson had served under anyone other than the city manager, but he knew COVID-19 was a special circumstance.\n\n“It was my understanding that this arrangement was temporary and necessary due to the COVID-19 restrictions and I complied with your request,” Buckson wrote in an email to Lynn and the commissioners.\n\nThen the governor reopened beaches for Memorial Day weekend. With lifeguards resuming their normal duties, Buckson was surprised to find that the beach patrol would remain under Banks’ supervision.\n\nMORE REHOBOTH NEWS:Rehoboth Beach prevails in first nativity scene lawsuit decision\n\nALSO:Duck Donuts opens in downtown Rehoboth Beach\n\nAccording to Buckson, Lynn said she was “too overwhelmed to handle it,” but assured him it was a temporary situation.\n\nBanks took over many aspects of the beach patrol, Buckson said, including payroll, hiring and firing, restricting work hours and budget issues — all formerly Buckson’s responsibilities.\n\n“It resulted in a stressful and confusing environment for me and my entire staff,” Buckson wrote.\n\nHe called the police department’s involvement “counterproductive,” citing payroll mistakes, the scrutiny of salaries and unprofessional emails.\n\nIn a letter to Lynn and the commissioners, Buckson wrote, “Most concerningly, you and Chief Banks directed a criminal investigation based on an anonymous, defamatory letter against my character and contacted former and current lifeguards without my knowledge.” He said he was later exonerated of any wrongdoing.\n\nRehoboth Beach spokeswoman Krys Johnson declined to comment on any investigation against Buckson. Chief Banks said he could not comment on personnel matters.\n\nDenied appeal\n\nThings came to a head for Buckson when he met with Lynn and Banks Oct. 15. According to Buckson, at that meeting, Lynn indicated the police chief’s supervision of the beach patrol would continue in 2021.\n\nBuckson filed an appeal with the commissioners Oct. 27, requesting a hearing on Lynn’s transference of authority without their approval.\n\nMORE:Rehoboth restaurants will have to pay to use outdoor dining barricades next year\n\nCOVID-19:Beebe administers first COVID-19 vaccines in Sussex County\n\nThe commissioners heard his request at the Nov. 20 commissioners’ meeting, which was held remotely. Buckson was not present; the request was read to the commissioners by city solicitor Glenn Mandalas.\n\nWhile the commissioners were aware Lynn had indicated to Buckson that she planned for the police chief to continue supervision of the beach patrol in 2021, they focused on the fact that, thus far, Lynn had operated in accordance with city policies.\n\n“How I view this is that there is no dispute right now... Under emergency conditions, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol can be under control of police department,” said Mayor Stan Mills. “In my view what this is asking is something about the future that hasn’t happened yet.”\n\nCommissioner Ed Chrzanowski had a different viewpoint.\n\n“I struggle a little bit with not ... giving an opportunity for employees to be heard when they have an issue, whether it’s current or future,” Chrzanowski said. “I don’t think there’s any value in waiting until (Buckson is) rehired in April to deal with an issue that could be dealt with beforehand.”\n\nHowever, the other commissioners concurred with Mills and they declined to hear Buckson’s appeal.\n\n“She punted her responsibilities of supervising the beach patrol and me as captain,” Buckson said. “And then when I pushed back nobody supported me on it.”\n\nCharter change proposed\n\nAt a Dec. 7 commissioners’ workshop, city solicitor Glenn Mandalas proposed a charter change to clarify that the city manager may delegate supervisory authority over city employees and departments.\n\nMore:Indian River breaks ground at new school\n\nRELATED:Mills defeats Kuhns in Rehoboth mayoral race\n\n“In consulting with our labor attorney, we both thought it might be worthwhile to seek a charter amendment to remove any question,” Mandalas said.\n\nCommissioner Jay Lagree took issue with the proposed change.\n\n“My opinion is the people who wrote our charter must have felt very strongly about the status and the importance of the iconic position of the beach patrol, and indeed, the beach patrol is an important part of our brand,” he said.\n\n“To put this under the chief of police or another department ... is a demotion for the beach patrol. If I was the captain... I would fight for the status of my organization, like the one that we have now who has been doing that.”\n\nLynn said she was not questioning Buckson’s performance.\n\n“This is an assignment for the police department to supervise the beach patrol captain, that’s all it is,” she said. “Any city manager should be able to delegate authority on a continuous basis ... That’s why you hire a professional manager with the expertise to do that.”\n\nBuckson called in to the meeting, but rather than give his opinion on the charter change, he insisted his appeal be heard.\n\n“Since this proposed bill directly impacts the operations and structure of the beach patrol, I cannot support this bill without first having the opportunity to be heard at a full hearing before the commissioners,” Buckson said.\n\nMore:This chicken is living a charmed life after being picked up by animal control\n\nMore:Coastal Smokehouse nears opening, Frog Bar, Coach's Corner close doors: What's going there\n\nThe commissioners ultimately decided to continue discussing the charter change at their January workshop, but not before Commissioner Chrzanowski said, “The fact that all of you refused to listen to a 30-year employee’s input ... is a problem.”\n\nThe resignation\n\nAfter some reflection, Buckson sent a letter of resignation to the commissioners Dec. 18.\n\n“I was hopeful that the issues that gave rise to my request for an appeal hearing would have been discussed and resolved amicably,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, I was denied an opportunity to be heard.”\n\nSpeaking by phone on Dec. 29, Buckson said, “I just wanted to talk about this and tell them why it wasn’t it a good fit, and they didn’t even give me the common decency to hear my appeal. Then three weeks later, what do they do? The city manager drafts a change to the charter ... on what they were to hear my appeal on.”\n\nAccording to Buckson, when Banks took over Lynn’s position as supervisor, he also took over most of Buckson’s duties as captain.\n\n“I asked for roles and responsibilities time after time,” he said. “Maybe a new captain, who doesn’t understand what they’ve lost, can work in this forced relationship.”\n\nBuckson hopes to lifeguard again in another beach town, if the opportunity presents itself.\n\n“I love lifeguarding, I love the community, the environment,” he said. “It’s been in my blood for 30 years.\"\n\nMORE:How Delaware's lifeguard patrols are dealing with COVID-19 cases\n\nTHE YEAR IN PHOTOS:Reflections of 2020 in Delaware\n\nWhen asked about his future plans for the beach patrol, Chief Banks said, “The city has recently opened up the process for hiring a new captain of the beach patrol. Once that process is over and someone has been chosen for that position, I look forward to discussions and formulating a plan for 2021.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/28/best-chocolate-shop-every-state-gifts/38528119/", "title": "Seeking a sweet gift?

Chocolate.\n\nThe tasty treat isn't just a checkout-line impulse buy. Chocolate has a rich history.\n\nThe Olmecs in southern Mexico may have been the first to roast and grind the beans of the cacao tree to make beverages and gruel as early as 1500 B.C. Three thousand years later, Spanish conquistadors discovered Aztecs sipping a drink they called \"chocolatl,\" meaning warm liquid.\n\nThe Spanish brought chocolate back to Europe, and the rest is history, as men such as John Cadbury, Henri Nestle and Rodolphe Lindt built sweet reputations.\n\nIn the U.S., Milton S. Hershey made the first milk chocolate candy in 1900, and candy bars became a fad. During the first half of the 1900s, 40,000 different candy bars were introduced. And Whitman's sold its first sampler boxes of individual chocolates in 1912.\n\nThese days, imaginative chocolatiers have taken the treat in ever new directions. And with so many outlets, exploring your options – purely for gift-giving purposes, of course – can be a delicious trek.\n\nSure, there are some people who don't like chocolate. But we don't acknowledge them. And besides, there's more to love at these shops than just chocolate.\n\nAnd so, here is the best chocolate shop in every state.

What to know about recreational marijuana", "text": "Delaware became the 22nd state to legalize recreational marijuana Sunday after Gov. John Carney allowed two bills to become law without his signature.\n\nIt marks an end to a lengthy fight by Democrats to legalize the drug and create an industry with the potential to bring in tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue.\n\nBut what does that mean for Delawareans looking to purchase legal weed or get a license to sell it? We've answered some of the big questions about the future of recreational marijuana in the First State.\n\nBACKGROUND:Carney allows Delaware weed bills to become law without signature. 'It’s time to move on'\n\nWhen can I buy weed in Delaware?\n\nDelawareans will not be able to purchase recreational weed in the First State for at least 16 months.\n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nBuying recreational marijuana will be similar to buying alcohol. You must be at least 21 years old and have a government ID.\n\nAnyone who meets these requirements can get a predetermined \"personal use\" amount of weed: 1 ounce or less of leaf marijuana, 12 grams or less of concentrated cannabis, or cannabis products containing 750 milligrams or less of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.\n\nIt will still be illegal to consume marijuana in public, and employers can continue to enforce their own zero-tolerance drug policies.\n\nWhat if I'm currently facing charges?\n\nIt's unclear from the two bills passed what will happen to people facing charges related to marijuana.\n\nPossessing less than an ounce of marijuana has been decriminalized in Delaware since 2015. However, anyone under 21 caught with weed or with a large amount still faced charges.\n\nWhat happens to medical marijuana centers?\n\nThere will be no changes to any laws about medical marijuana, and there will not be any new taxes on it.\n\nIt is unclear whether medical marijuana centers can also apply to sell recreational marijuana or what that process would look like.\n\nHow will licenses be handed out?\n\nDelawareans can begin applying for licenses to sell, test or cultivate marijuana in 13 months, with the first licenses handed out in 14 months. Licenses will cost $10,000 every two years, and they can be taken away at any time.\n\nThe new laws also include special provisions to ensure equity in licenses. This means that people from communities disproportionately impacted by drug possession arrests or who have been arrested for lower-level drug crimes themselves will have state assistance in applying for licenses, lower fees and dedicated licenses set aside for them.\n\nWhat are the rules for transporting marijuana?\n\nYou can now drive with marijuana within Delaware, as long as it's in a sealed container and out of reach from everyone in the car. Just don't take it out of the state — that's illegal at the federal level and can bring hefty charges.\n\nIt's also illegal to drive after consuming marijuana and runs the same penalties as drunken driving.\n\nCan I now bring marijuana in from states that already legalized it?\n\nNo. Transporting marijuana across state lines is illegal at the federal level, even between two states that have legalized it.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

But cannabis is still a no-no under federal law.\n\nWeed is legal in Delaware:Here's how to get in on the business opportunity\n\nThe cannabis landscape in the U.S. is rapidly changing with other states legalizing cannabis for recreational use, like Maryland and New Jersey have. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden in May endorsed the Justice Department's move to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug.\n\nWhile this change does not make weed legal nationally, it shows a shift in how the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sees marijuana's risk for abuse and use in medical scenarios. Marijuana will still be a controlled substance.\n\nMore:With marijuana reclassification on the table, here's a breakdown on Schedule 3 drugs\n\nHere's what you need to know before buying and traveling with cannabis:\n\nCan I fly with cannabis?\n\nThat's a hard no.\n\nRegardless of where you're flying to or from, marijuana and certain cannabis-infused products remain illegal under federal law. Products that contain no more than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis are allowed.\n\nWhile Transportation Security Administration agents do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, if they do find an illegal substance during security screening, the federal agents will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer.\n\nIt will then be up to the local police to decide how to handle it.\n\nWhat about cannabis on the train?\n\nNo to the pineapple express.\n\nThe use or transportation of marijuana in any form for any purpose is prohibited, according to Beth Toll, an Amtrak spokesperson.\n\n\"Even in states or countries where recreational use is legal or permitted medically,\" Toll added.\n\nWhat about traveling with weed in the car?\n\nYes and no. It all depends on where you're going.\n\nHere is the skinny, thanks to Keila Montalvo, a spokesperson with the Delaware Office of the Marijuana Commissioner.\n\nCan I drive across state lines with cannabis I purchase in Delaware?\n\nNo.\n\n\"Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and you may not carry or transport marijuana over state lines,\" Montalvo said. \"It remains illegal to leave (or enter) Delaware with any marijuana products — medical or adult-use (non-medical) products.\"\n\nMailing marijuana in or out of the state is also illegal.\n\nCan out-of-staters come to Delaware to purchase cannabis?\n\nOut-of-state medical marijuana cardholders can make purchases in Delaware, however, they must comply with state and federal laws — that means they cannot legally leave the state with it.\n\nIn Delaware towns where cannabis operations are prohibited, will people who legally purchase cannabis elsewhere be allowed to have their cannabis with them?\n\nWhile a municipality may prohibit cannabis businesses within their jurisdictions, Montalvo said they cannot take away a person's right to consume recreationally.\n\n\"If the individual has up to a personal use quantity of 1 ounce and is not actively consuming while behind the wheel or in public an individual can legally transport products throughout the state in these municipalities,\" she said.\n\nWhile a person can have the legal amount of cannabis on them, a person cannot smoke cannabis in public.\n\n\"You cannot smoke or ingest in an area accessible to the public or in any vehicle,\" she added.\n\nCheck out the office's website for answers to other frequently asked questions.\n\nSend tips or story ideas to Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299 or eparra@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/04/29/is-delta-8-legal/11530893002/", "title": "Is Delta 8 legal? A state-by-state guide.", "text": "The legal framework for delta-8 THC that exists is a bit of a patchwork. The intoxicating cannabinoid has had a meteoric rise in popularity across the country, in part due to its availability even in states where marijuana is illegal.\n\nThe substance, which is sourced from hemp, is legal at the federal level through a loophole in the 2018 farm bill. However, various states have banned it and others are actively working on regulation.\n\nThe result is a map that is confusing for both consumers and producers.\n\nHere's what you should know about the hazy and ever-evolving legal landscape of delta-8 legislation.\n\nIs delta-8 legal?\n\nSince delta-8 THC is sourced from hemp, and not marijuana, it is legal and unregulated at the federal level. The 2018 farm bill legalized hemp, cracking open an industry with offshoots in textile manufacturing, medicine and (albeit accidentally) intoxicants.\n\nWith sales exploding across the country, legislators and medical professionals have begun to sound the alarm on not only the unchecked accessibility but also the unregulated production process.\n\n“What I am paranoid about is legalizing and using legally stuff that we don’t know anything about. And we know very little about delta-8,” said Daniele Piomelli, the director of the Centfor the Study of Cannabis at the University of California Irvine.\n\nAs a state-by-state regulations begin to take shape, Piomelli worries that the right voices are not being heard. Most lawyers have no idea about the chemistry, he said.\n\nThough delta-8 is similar to delta-9 — the chemical component of marijuana that accounts for that \"high\" feeling — they are not identical. Both are psychoactive and connect to the same receptor in the brain to cause intoxication, but delta-8's connection is weaker, creating a lesser effect (hence the nickname \"diet weed\"). That said, without formal regulation, the potency of delta-8 products varies and may not be reliably less psychoactive than delta-9 products.\n\nMost delta-8 is not sourced directly from the plant, but instead synthesized from CBD, which occurs more plentifully in hemp. That process can involve chemicals not fit to consume.\n\nWhy is delta-8 legal?\n\nThe government defines hemp as any part of the cannabis sativa plant with no more than 0.3% of THC — anything over that ventures into illegality.\n\nA legal dispute challenging the legitimacy of the loophole created by the 2018 farm bill was shot down in May 2022 when a federal judge in California ruled that the production of delta-8 along with other hemp-derived cannabidiols was legal.\n\n“Regardless of the wisdom of legalizing delta-8 THC products, this court will not substitute its own policy judgment for that of Congress,” Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote in the court’s unanimous decision.\n\nIn punting the decision to Congress, the court left room for states to step in and create their own legislation.\n\nWhat is delta-8? The battle over 'diet weed' is heating up nationally. What to know.\n\nIn what states is delta-8 legal?\n\nTwenty-four states including Washington DC have unintentionallylegalized hemp-derived intoxicants by updating their controlled substance law to reflect changes in the 2018 farm bill, said Chris Lindsey, the Director of State Campaigns and Public Policy at the American Trade Association of Cannabis and Hemp.\n\nBecause the farm bill defined hemp as being cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC, delta-8, as well as delta-10, are technically legal in those 24 states.\n\nThe rest of the map is ever-evolving, but this is where it currently stands, according to materials from the American Trade Association for Cannabis and Hemp.\n\nStates that regulate delta-8\n\nRather than let the proliferation go unchecked, a number of legislatures have chosen to regulate the production and sale of delta-8. Those states include:\n\nMinnesota\n\nLouisiana\n\nKentucky\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nVirginia\n\nVermont\n\nFlorida\n\nTennessee\n\nFor states that have already legalized marijuana, delta-8 is regulated by agencies that were already charged with keeping an eye on intoxicating cannabis substances. These states include:\n\nConnecticut\n\nMaryland\n\nMichigan\n\nNevada\n\nOregon\n\nUtah\n\nNew York\n\nStates where delta-8 is banned\n\nOther states had laws on the books that prohibited the sale of delta-8 or have put in place bans after the 2018 farm bill. Those states include:\n\nAlaska\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nColorado\n\nDelaware\n\nIdaho\n\nIowa\n\nMississippi\n\nMontana\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nRhode Island\n\nWashington\n\nOne state passed regulatory authority to their marijuana programs and those bodies chose to ban it. Those states are:\n\nCalifornia\n\nDelta-8 is also banned in Hawaii but by an administrative rule, not a law.\n\nIn Arkansas and Maryland, state laws have been passed attempting to regulate Delta-8 but actions brought in federal court have stalled a regulatory framework. While for now, it remains unregulated, the gears are in motion for a change, Lindsey says. A similar case could arise in Indiana, but the courts have not yet ruled on a preliminary injunction which stalls the regulation. In Virginia, a court ruled recently that the state was free to regulate.\n\nThe cannabis conundrum\n\nA question that resurfaces often in the delta-8 debate is whether, if marijuana were more widely legal, there would even be a market for delta-8 products.\n\nPiomelli thinks not. While there are always a few outliers who want to experiment, he believes the vast majority of people would prefer regular \"pot\" if given the choice. It has been more extensively studied and, ostensibly, yields better results (aka, a stronger high).\n\nMiller said anecdotally, delta-8 has seen increased popularity in states where weed is not legal and it can be used as a substitute.\n\n“There is only one simple solution to this and it is not regulating but deregulating, removing cannabis from Schedule I,\" Piomelli said.\n\nWith one unambiguous step, the federal government could quash the delta-8 issue and financially de-incentivize the marijuana-look-alike market, he argued.\n\nOthers are not as certain.\n\n“We’re not vouching for the use of gin but we need to take the bathtub out of bathtub gin,” Lindsey said.\n\nWhile he understands that some scientists and medical professionals believe delta-8 has not been sufficiently studied to justify legality, he believes regulation is a public health need.\n\n“Creating a regulatory program isn’t the same as embracing the product,\" he said, explaining that the government wouldn't be endorsing delta-8, it's creating a harm reduction framework.\n\nIn a system Piomelli describes as \"born of confusion,\" the growing consensus among advocates is that there should be at least a few clear lines.\n\nMy dog ate weed:What do I do?

There's still a chance\n\nPossessing less than an ounce of marijuana – an amount that was decriminalized in Delaware in 2019 – can rack up fines. And if police believe there's an intent to deliver or distribute the drugs, they could press felony charges.\n\nLike Delaware, medical weed has been available to qualifying New Jersey residents for over a decade.

As the law stands, police can pull someone over if they suspect them of driving while high. This also provides probable cause for officers to search a car.\n\nAnyone suspected of driving under the influence, whether it be drugs or alcohol, also must submit to a drug test as part of Delaware's \"implied consent\" law, according to the Division of Motor Vehicles.\n\nMORE ON THE GARDEN STATE:Wilmington has a 'homicide crisis.'

Gun dealers, meanwhile, would be required to submit information on every gun sold and every gun purchaser for entry into a new state database.\n\nThe Democrats also have resurrected and strengthened a proposed ban on certain semiautomatic weapons that gun control advocates describe as \"assault weapons\" and a proposed ban on \"large capacity\" magazines.\n\nBackground:\n\nDelaware Legislature eyes gun control, marijuana and ballot box in new session\n\nWeakened bump stock ban sent back to Delaware House\n\nThe ban on military-style semiautomatic rifles, also known as modern sporting rifles, is once again being sponsored by Sen. Bryan Townsend, a Democrat from Newark.\n\nTownsend sponsored similar legislation last year that failed to get out of committee, then was the subject of a failed effort to suspend Senate rules and bring it up for a floor vote.\n\nAs with last year's bill, a draft of the revised legislation identifies dozens of \"assault long guns\" and \"assault pistols\" that would be banned, with violators subject to felony charges.\n\nThe ban also would extend to \"copycat\" weapons, including any centerfire rifle that has a detachable magazine coupled with a folding stock and a pistol grip that \"protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon,\" and any pistol or centerfire rifle with a fixed magazine holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe legislation, with certain exceptions, would prohibit the sale and transfer of such firearms, as well as transportation across state lines into Delaware. It would not ban possession of weapons purchased legally before the legislation's effective date but would impose restrictions on where they could be possessed and transported.\n\nUnlike last year's legislation, the bill includes a new provision allowing people who already own the proscribed firearms to submit a \"voluntary certificate of possession\" to state officials as proof of pre-ban ownership. To obtain a certificate — a separate one for each gun — a gun owner would have to submit personal information, and a thumbprint, that would go into a state database.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also are again proposing a ban on \"large capacity\" magazines, defined as any device holding more than 10 rounds. A similar measure introduced last year was amended to allow magazines holding up to 17 rounds. Given that many Delawareans already possess such magazines, last year's proposed ban also applied only to possession of a high-capacity magazine in a public place while also in possession of a firearm capable of accepting such a magazine.\n\nA draft of this year's bill draws no such distinction and requires people who already lawfully own the proscribed magazines to surrender them to state authorities by June 30, 2020.\n\nThe bills are expected to be focal points of discussion at rallies being held Wednesday outside Legislative Hall by both gun rights supporters and gun control advocates.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/07/delaware-legal-weed-marijuana-vote-general-assembly/7547618002/", "title": "Legalizing marijuana in Delaware: State lawmakers take another shot", "text": "Delaware's latest bill to legalize marijuana is expected to get its first floor vote in the House this week, facing what will likely be its biggest hurdle.\n\nThe bill to legalize recreational marijuana — House Bill 150 by Rep. Ed Osienski, D-Newark, which would let people 21 years or older buy up to an ounce of weed from a licensed seller — is scheduled for a vote on the House floor on Thursday, he said.\n\nLawmakers have been perennially unsuccessful in the fight to legalize weed in Delaware, but more pressure is on the state than ever before after New Jersey voters legalized it through a ballot initiative in the November election and other nearby states move to follow suit.\n\nIf the First State does not legalize it, many residents will simply cross state lines to buy the drug, funnel tax revenue into other governments' coffers and then return home to consume it, advocates said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Gov. John Carney, who has split from most of his party on this issue by not supporting legal weed, would sign the bill into law if the General Assembly passed it. The governor's position against legal weed hasn't changed, a spokesman said on Friday.\n\nDemocrats control three-fifths of both the House and Senate, and the bill needs three-fifths of lawmakers' support because it includes a tax. Unlike in the House, Senate Democrats enjoy a two-thirds majority, which gives them an even bigger leg up.\n\nBut legal weed is still far from guaranteed. Osienski did not immediately respond to an inquiry on Monday about whether his bill has enough votes in the House.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have historically not been unified around the policy.\n\nRep. Stephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington, and House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, for example, abstained from voting on a similar proposal in 2018 that contributed to its defeat on the floor.\n\nBut some House Republicans like Rep. Jeffrey Spiegelman, R-Clayton, who voted for the bill in 2018, could vote yes this week.\n\nDelaware's political environment has also changed since 2018. Younger, more progressive lawmakers have unseated Republicans and moderate Democrats within the past few years, which could give the bill an advantage on Thursday.\n\nRegulating sales of the plant would cost the state more than $3 million a year for the first three years, according to an official financial analysis of the bill.\n\nThe analysis does not forecast costs beyond then. Business and license fees would bring in less than $1 million a year, and there is no tax revenue estimate attached to the bill.\n\nShould the bill pass, Delaware would tax the plant at 15%, which is lower than that of most states that have legalized marijuana.\n\nIn a January report, State Auditor Kathy McGuiness estimated that Delaware could bring in $43 million a year in revenue if it taxed pot at 20%. That report was released almost two months before the bill was introduced.\n\nLawmakers are in session until June 30. After that, they go on a six-month break. Because Delaware's legislative session spans two years, any bills they do not pass this year will still be on the table in 2022.\n\nTHE BILL:Legal marijuana in Delaware?

Jack Markell signed the legislation into law almost immediately.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington, allows Delawareans to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and use the drug privately without facing criminal sanctions, although police can confiscate the drugs.\n\nCriminal penalties for simple possession will be replaced with a $100 civil fine. The law takes effect six months after Markell's signature.\n\nAn amendment discussed in committee on Wednesday, to reduce the amount of marijuana in the legislation to a half ounce, did not make it to the floor for debate. The decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups and Republicans.\n\nSelling marijuana remains criminal under the law. No Republican voted in favor of the legislation in either the House or the Senate.\n\nAfter the signing, Markell's spokeswoman Kelly Bachman said in a statement: \"The governor remains committed to reducing the number of people entering the criminal justice system and refocusing resources where they are needed most and House Bill 39 supports these efforts.\"\n\nSen. Colin Bonini, a Dover Republican said, \"This is a vote we're going to really, really regret. Would you want your kid smoking weed? I think the answer is overwhelmingly no.\"\n\nRobert Capecchi, a lobbyist with the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, said in a statement after Thursday's vote, \"Marijuana is an objectively less harmful substance than alcohol, and most Americans now agree it should be treated that way. Delaware has taken an important step toward adopting a more sensible marijuana policy.\"\n\nNineteen other states and the District of Columbia have stopped charging citizens criminally for possessing small amounts of marijuana. In Delaware, like in other states, there is evidence that the law is disproportionately enforced along racial lines, which was a driving force behind this bill's passage.\n\nBlack people in Delaware were three times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession in 2010, despite accounting for a much smaller portion of the population, according to a 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMarijuana arrests previously threatened to saddle Delawareans with a criminal record, something the legislation's supporters believed was unnecessary for a drug that they say poses few risks.\n\n\"It's safer for me to choose cannabis over alcohol,\" Zoe Patchell, a Delaware marijuana activist with Cannabis Bureau of Delaware, said during committee testimony on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill's supporters did give some ground to opponents, especially those in the law enforcement community. Language added by amendments strictly define a public place where it will remain criminal to consume marijuana. Public places include any outdoor space within 10 feet of any window or sidewalk.\n\nDelawareans under 21 also still face criminal penalties if caught with marijuana under an amendment added in the House. And it will remain criminal to consume marijuana in a moving vehicle under the current legislation.\n\nPolice groups remained concerned throughout legislative debate that decriminalizing marijuana possession could limit their ability to initiate searches that could lead to even more substantial charges for drug dealers and traffickers.\n\nAttorney General Matt Denn, the state's top law enforcement official, said Thursday that he supported the decriminalization measure. \"I've said for some time that we're generally supportive of possession of small amounts being treated as a civil rather than a criminal offense,\" Denn said.\n\nSen. Brian Pettyjohn, a Georgetown Republican, said an ounce of marijuana is far more than necessary for personal use. Pettyjohn used a bag of oregano for illustration, saying an ounce would be enough for more than 40 joints.\n\n\"That's a lot of marijuana. You could do a lot with it. You could have a big party with it,\" Pettyjohn said. \"This is much more than what personal use would be.\"\n\nLike some police groups, he said the legislation would provide safe harbor for Delawareans looking to sell the drug.\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/15/delaware-rep-ruth-briggs-king-resigning-from-state-legislature/71590534007/", "title": "Delaware Rep.

Ruth Briggs King announced Wednesday she will be resigning from her legislative seat as she moves across district lines into a new home.\n\nBriggs King, a Republican who represents Georgetown/Millsboro, was first elected to the 37th District seat in September 2009 during a special election to fill the position vacated by former state Rep. Joe Booth.\n\n“Today, I am ready to embark on my next challenge and change that will allow me to explore, learn, and better serve my community. After 14 years of public service, I will be resigning my position in the legislature to move into our new home,” she said in a news release. “Our new residence is located just over the district line from the 37th District. I will soon become a resident of the 35th District.”\n\nThe elected representative said this will come as “no surprise” to many people as she’s been “open about the impending changes.”\n\nRedistricting has recently changed the district lines once again for Delaware’s House of Representatives, the third time since Briggs King was first elected in 2009, she said.\n\nDELAWARE LEADERS:State congressional officials not in support of growing protests seeking Gaza cease-fire\n\n“My hope is that my successor will continue placing at the forefront of elected office: quality constituent services, protecting our Constitutional rights, and promoting good governance,” Briggs King said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nWith Briggs King resigning effective immediately, the chairperson of the county committee for each political party must name a candidate to run in the special election to fill the seat.\n\n2024 RACES:Who is running for office in 2024? Our updated list of Delaware candidates, announcements\n\nUnder state law, when there is a vacancy in the state House of Representatives, the speaker must issue a “Writ of Election” within 10 days of the vacancy in order for a special election to occur.\n\nThe Department of Elections then must set the special election for 30-35 days after the writ is issued.\n\nBriggs King’s accomplishments\n\nThe longtime representative pointed to many accomplishments during her time in office, including efforts to address the opioid epidemic.\n\nBriggs King was a prime sponsor of “Aiden’s Law” in response to the September 2015 death of 8-month-old Aiden Hundley, a Sussex County child who “was reportedly born with symptoms consistent with prenatal drug exposure” and died at the hands of his parents, who were later convicted of a crime.\n\nShe also championed bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting infants exposed to illegal drugs and alcohol during the mother’s pregnancy by implementing improved safeguards.\n\nPOLICE RECORDS:Delawareans can't access police misconduct records. House lawmakers voted to change that\n\nBriggs King has also focused on providing “hands-on” services to constituents, pointing to her efforts to preserve the Richard Allen School in Georgetown and her continued efforts as a “strong voice for the Hispanic community.”\n\nDuring the most recent legislative session, Briggs King served as a member of the following House committees: Joint Finance; Appropriations; Health & Human Development; Corrections; Judiciary; Public Safety & Homeland Security; Transportation; and Veterans Affairs.\n\nShe also served on the Structural Revenue Review Task Force, the Mental Health Task Force, the Educational Funding Task Force, and the Retired Employee Benefits Task Force.\n\nBriggs King has served on the boards for Cheer; the Boys and Girls Club of Riverdale and Oak Orchard; and the Sussex County Community Crisis House, as well.\n\nGot a tip?

News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Voting along party lines, the Delaware state Senate gave final approval Thursday to a measure that decriminalizes the possession and private use of small amounts of marijuana, and Gov. Jack Markell almost immediately signed the legislation into law.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Helene Keeley,, allows Delawareans to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and use the drug privately without facing criminal sanctions.\n\nCriminal penalties for simple possession will be replaced with a civil $100 fine. The law takes effect in six months.\n\nThe decriminalization measure, which cleared the House earlier this month, passed despite significant opposition from police groups, and from Republicans.\n\nSelling marijuana remains criminal under the law. No Republican voted in favor of the legislation in either the House or the Senate.\n\n\"This is a vote we're going to really, really regret,\" Republican Sen. Colin Bonini said. \"Would you want your kid smoking weed. I think the answer is overwhelmingly no.\"\n\nIn a statement after Thursday's vote, Robert Capecchi, a lobbyist with the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, said \"marijuana is an objectively less harmful substance than alcohol, and most Americans now agree it should be treated that way. Delaware has taken an important step toward adopting a more sensible marijuana policy,\" Capecchi said.\n\nNineteen other states and the District of Columbia have stopped charging citizens criminally for possessing small amounts of marijuana. In Delaware, like in other states, there is evidence that the law is disproportionately enforced along racial lines, which was a driving force behind the bill's passage.\n\nBlacks in Delaware were three times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession in 2010, despite accounting for a much smaller portion of the population, according to a 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMarijuana arrests previously threatened to saddle Delawareans with a criminal record, something the legislation's supporters believed was unnecessary for a drug that they say poses few risks.\n\n\"It's safer for me to choose cannabis over alcohol,\" Zoe Patchell, a Delaware marijuana activist with Cannabis Bureau of Delaware, said during committee testimony Wednesday.\n\nThe bill's supporters did give some ground to opponents, especially those in the law enforcement community. Language added by amendments strictly defines a public place where it will remain criminal to consume marijuana. Public places include any outdoor space within 10 feet of any window or sidewalk.\n\nDelawareans under 21 also still face criminal penalties if caught with marijuana under an amendment added in the House. And it will remain criminal to consume marijuana in a moving vehicle under the current legislation.\n\nPolice groups remained concerned throughout legislative debate that decriminalizing marijuana possession could limit their ability to initiate searches that could lead to even more substantial charges for drug dealers and traffickers.\n\nState Attorney General Matt Denn, the state's top law enforcement official, said Thursday that he supported the decriminalization measure. \"I've said for some time that we're generally supportive of possession of small amounts being treated as a civil rather than a criminal offense,\" Denn said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/10/04/end-marijuana-prohibition-delaware-voices/728196001/", "title": "End marijuana prohibition: Delaware Voices", "text": "Jack Guerin\n\nThe nationwide prohibition of alcohol proved to be a tragic failure. Bootlegging was widespread and organized crime took control of the distribution of alcohol. Chicago became notorious as a haven for Prohibition-dodging crime organizations.\n\nOpponents argued for repeal because Prohibition made the United States a nation of hypocrites and undermined respect for the rule of law.\n\nMore from this writer:Wilmington police must build trust\n\nProhibition ended decisively with the ratification of the 21st Amendment in 1933. “Moonshine” and “speakeasies” have become historical terms. There is an overwhelming national consensus that the prohibition of alcohol did more harm than good.\n\nOther voices:Don't buy the myths — DACA should stay\n\nNow we face a similar set of issues with the prohibition of marijuana, but the government response has been different. More than half the states have legalized the use of marijuana in some form, while other states and the federal government continue prohibition.\n\nProhibition and legalization are no longer binary terms.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, there are 32,000 marijuana growers in a three-county area of California, which is labeled the Golden Triangle. Ninety percent (90 percent) of these farmers are resisting enrollment in California’s recently legalized recreational marijuana program because of the huge incentive to remain in the black market.\n\nOn the East Coast, marijuana sells for several times more than in California. The Times estimates that California exports more than seven times more marijuana than it consumes.\n\nOur nation’s economy is based on interstate commerce. Both legal and illegal products flow freely across state lines.\n\nIt is estimated that 100,000 people in Delaware use marijuana. Our nation and our state are awash with illegal drugs, enriching cartels and gangs while fueling the endless “War on Drugs” and mass incarceration.\n\nIn Delaware, our General Assembly has approved the use of medical marijuana and created the ultimate Catch 22 by allowing possession of up to one ounce of marijuana while providing no legal path to acquisition. Now, with the introduction last session of House Bill 110, Delaware is cautiously considering legalization of recreational marijuana.\n\nThe General Assembly has formed a 25-member Adult Use Cannabis Task Force which recently had its first meeting and is scheduled to submit a report by the end of January.\n\nThere seems to be little urgency to reduce the black market for illegal drugs in Delaware, which continues to fuel violence in Wilmington and other Delaware communities. Our governor is calling for more time and research before taking action to reform drug policy.\n\nOur country’s drug policy, based on prohibition and prosecution, has been a spectacular failure. Last year approximately 64,000 Americans died of drug overdoses — about as many as were killed in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars combined.\n\nEuropean nations have generally taken a different approach, focusing on addiction as a health problem instead of a criminal justice issue. The rate of drug-related deaths in Europe is a small fraction of the U.S. death rate, which was over 300 per million people in 2015. Seven major European countries had drug death rates of twenty-two or less. The rate in Portugal was only six.\n\nEuropean countries have found that treatment is incomparably cheaper than incarceration. The Portuguese Health Ministry spends less than $10 per citizen to support its drug treatment programs. The United States has spent approximately $10,000 per household over decades fighting the “War on Drugs” that results in more than 1,000 deaths per week.\n\nGiven the massive destruction attributed to both alcohol and opiates, balking at legalizing marijuana seems an odd place to draw a line in the sand. There are no deaths attributed to marijuana.\n\nDespite decades of “reefer madness” type propaganda, virtually no ill effects have been linked to marijuana.\n\nA recent report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that studies were equally divided in finding driver impairment related to marijuana. The report stated, “An interesting finding from this research is that after smoking marijuana, subjects in most of the simulator and instrumented vehicle studies on marijuana and driving typically drive slower, follow other cars at greater distances, and take fewer risks than when sober.”\n\nDelaware can only benefit by reducing the black market in illegal drugs. Our government should not delay in reforming failed drug policies.\n\nJack Guerin is co-chair of the Unitarian Universalist Delaware Advocacy Network.

In the biggest moments, we were there to make the biggest plays.\"\n\nAs it commences an autumn sequel, Delaware must follow a similar script in which offensive and defensive execution remains timely and consistent and mistakes are minimal.\n\n\"It always comes down to those critical moments,\" Rocco said.\n\nHere are five key determining factors to keep in mind as Delaware opens at Maine:\n\n1. Is the offensive line up to the task?\n\nThe Blue Hens’ offensive front was undermined by injuries and didn’t hold up well in Delaware’s 33-3 FCS semifinal loss at South Dakota State in the spring. Making it better and deeper has been one of Delaware’s priorities since.\n\nRocco repeated on his radio show this week his belief that much of a football team’s success comes down to offensive line performance, and few would disagree. But issues do remain.\n\nStarting center Mickey Henry missed most of preseason camp with an injury and James Prince III is likely to be in the starting lineup Thursday in his place. Starting spring guard Stevon Brown also practiced very little and his status remains questionable, with Bradly Anyanwu most likely to start.\n\nLeft tackle David Kroll, right tackle Ben Trent, and right guard Patrick Shupp are also likely starters.\n\nBORN TO RUN: Dejoun Lee ready for better fall\n\nEarly this week the unit remained in flux.\n\n“We have different combinations but we don’t have everybody available,” Rocco said. “That’s just kinda what it is.”\n\nRocco added that he does like his “pool of candidates” and the versatility it possesses. Robert Nachtman, for instance, has seen duty at both guard and tackle.\n\nRecent Illinois transfer Blaise Sparks has quickly ascended to the second unit as a tackle. Center Brock Gingrich, guard Lance Schwartz, and tackle Braden Clark have also seen duty there. All four are redshirt freshmen, however, in a position area where experience is the most valuable tool.\n\nHow this unit performs will play a key role in Thursday’s outcome and those beyond.\n\n2. Risk and reward\n\nThere is much at stake in opening the season with a conference game, especially in a league as deep and difficult as the Colonial Athletic Association.\n\nDelaware is 9-4 opening the season with a league foe since joining what was then the Yankee Conference in 1986. In the four seasons the Blue Hens lost, they only made the playoffs once. That was just three years ago, when Rhode Island won 21-19 at Delaware Stadium but the Blue Hens still earned their way into the FCS bracket.\n\nMAINE EVENT: Trips to Orono often treacherous for Blue Hens\n\n“Like it or not,” Rocco said, “it does create a very significant moment to start the season in conference play. I do recognize when your goals are consistent with what our goals are and what they’ve been, and one of those goals is to compete for a conference championship and be relevant in that discussion, opening with a conference game is that much more significant toward your goals.\n\n“But it’s fun also. It’s fun to get right into a meaningful moment.”\n\nThe high stakes in visiting a traditionally difficult league foe such as Maine should have also commanded the Blue Hens’ attention throughout camp, improved their approach, and crystalized their concentration.\n\n3. Skill position depth\n\nSome of preseason camp’s best revelations came in the backfield and at wide receiver, and these are areas where it may be fun to see who Delaware unleashes Thursday. Considering that heavy rain is forecast, and game time temperatures may be in the upper 50s, adaptability is going to be a necessity.\n\nThe Blue Hens have backfield depth beyond speedy slasher Dejoun Lee and his more bruising back-up Khory Spruill, especially in versatile Quincy Watts and recent Penn State transfer Joseph Bruno. Delaware may have more multiple-back opportunities and situations in which it throws to its running backs.\n\nAnd while Delaware has two of the CAA’s best pass catchers in Thyrick Pitts and Gene Coleman II, with Jourdan Townsend not far behind, the play of the next group – Brett Buckman, Noelly Miller, Mount Pleasant High graduate James Collins and even Austin Haverstrom, wowed Rocco during camp.\n\n“I’m really, really excited with what I’m seeing at that position,” he said.\n\nConsidering their importance and value in Delaware’s offense, the Hens will also need major contributions from their tight ends/H-backs, especially if starter Bryce DeMaille, who has missed some time due to injury, remains sidelined. Levaughn Lewis is viewed as a potential contributor there.\n\n4. There’s a difference\n\nMaine will start pretty much the same offensive unit Thursday night that it did in the spring opener. Remember, player eligibility didn’t count last season so everyone returns experienced lineups.\n\nBut here’s where there is a difference.\n\nMaine expects its defense to be better this fall both from the improvement of eight returning starters – Delaware resident Jamehl Wiley's 23 starts lead the team – plus the addition of several transfers.\n\nBE WARY: Ambitious Blue Hens can taking nothing for granted\n\nThat group features linebacker Ray Miller from Campbell, safety Fofie Bazzie from Maryland, and cornerback Kolubah Pewee from Army.\n\n“They’ve got more newer faces,” Rocco said.\n\nThe opening game typically brings mystery because of new schemes and new players, though the latter is lessened this year because of less roster turnover.\n\nBut Maine’s defensive additions are expected to make the Black Bears different and better, factors the Hens will have to work to overcome.\n\n5. No room for error\n\nBlocked punts can quickly sway the outcome of a football game and Delaware must avoid those Thursday.\n\nRemember, Delaware State’s two touchdowns in the Blue Hens’ 34-14 spring win in Dover came directly from a blocked punt and right after another. Stony Brook also blocked one in the March 13 game.\n\nIt’s an area Maine might view as a potential opportunity.\n\nThe Blue Hens’ employ a shield protection formation, with three lineman-type players stationed directly in front of punter Tyler Pastula.\n\nIt’s imperative Delaware executes this well, including blocking up front and getting a quick, on-target snap from Jake Reed, and thwart the pressure from the edge.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But Delaware has endured three-straight sub-.500 seasons in which it has won just three Colonial Athletic Association games.\n\n\"I think we'll be one of those programs that can compete with anybody in the country,\" said Shillinglaw, whose 7-9 2014 team suffered six losses by three goals or fewer. \"I expect a lot of close games. It'll be another white-knuckle, rollercoaster ride.''\n\nDelaware will bank on a traditional staple – strong faceoff play from preseason All-American Tyler Barberich – and rely on preseason All-CAA goalie Conor Peaks. Brandon Worrall's return from a knee injury is welcomed on a defense also featuring Caesar Rodney graduate Matt Matsko, a team co-captain.\n\nBrian Kormondy, Delaware's top returning scorer with 17 goals and 13 assists last year and a recent Major League Lacrosse draft pick, Steve Delargy and Jackson Finigan comprise a proven and versatile midfield crew. Tom Holland, who erupted for five goals in last year's regular-season-ending win at UMass, heads an improving group of attackers. Delaware returns five of its top six scorers from last year.\n\nIn another change this year, Shillinglaw has turned over offensive coordinator duties to new associate head coach Byron Collins, whose extensive background includes time as a Division III head coach and recent stints on the staffs at Penn State and Rutgers. Former Delaware goalie Noah Fossner is now coordinating the defense in place of former associate head coach Greg Carroll, who has moved into the business world.\n\n\"Conor is very strong in goal, and it obviously starts with defense for us,\" Shillinglaw said. \"Noah is coaching that group with a lot of passion, and there's no question we'll be relying on our transition game as an important part of our offense, where Byron has brought some great new ideas.''\n\nLacrosse team honors Pyle\n\nThe fire in the Annapolis, Maryland, mansion that killed 56-year-old Donald Pyle, wife Sandra, 63, and their four grandchildren, ages 6 to 8, on Jan. 19 made headlines and has been felt at Delaware.\n\nDonald Pyle was a UD graduate who played on Shillinglaw's first lacrosse team in 1979. He then became a successful businessman and headed several technology companies, including serving as chief operating officer of ScienceLogic, an IT-support company, at the time of his death. Authorities announced this week the fire was caused by an electric malfunction in Christmas tree lights.\n\nPyle had hosted an event for UD administrative and athletic personnel before the Blue Hens' 2013 football game at Navy at his 16,000-square-foot home, which was commonly referred to locally as \"the castle.\" It was built on a cliff overlooking the Severn River.\n\nLast October, Pyle had visited campus and given an inspirational talk to the UD lacrosse team, Shillinglaw said, about career development and his experiences.\n\n\"He was just a great guy – not an all-star player or anything like that – but just so supportive of our program and the university and a phenomenal businessman,\" said Shillinglaw.\n\nThe Blue Hens will wear helmet stickers bearing the initials DP and SP this season and recognize the Pyles with a moment of silence before next Sunday's home opener against Bucknell.\n\nSeeking strong second half\n\nDelaware's men's and women's basketball teams each felt the first halves of their CAA schedules could have been better, considering some tough losses. This weekend each begins to make the second round of CAA play more to their liking.\n\nThe men host the College of Charleston on Saturday at 2 p.m., and the women face a difficult Sunday trek to Hofstra. Both the men (4-16, 3-6) and women (9-11, 4-5) are battling now to stay in the CAA's top six, which avoids the play-in round of their March CAA tournaments.\n\nFor the men, finishing strong, which they failed to do in losses at UNCW, Elon and James Madison and home against Drexel, will be a prime focus.\n\n\"This is a young team,\" said junior forward Marvin King-Davis, whose career-high 31 points in Wednesday's 88-82 loss at James Madison is a positive sign. \"Once we get more consistent on defense and keep our offense going, we'll be tough to beat. I don't feel like other teams in the league are that much better than us.\"\n\nSince starting the CAA slate 0-3, the women have played 10 strong halves in their six games since, though the two not-so-good halves were costly in losses to William & Mary and Drexel.\n\n\"We've got a chance to try to crawl ourselves out of this and get to .500 and keep building,\" said 19th-year coach Tina Martin, who has had just one losing season in the last 16. \"We're just trying to piece it together right now, trying to get these young kids to learn how to play. I think we're doing that, inch by inch, baby step by baby step. We have continued to get better. Has it always been smooth? No. But they're learning.''\n\nHen scratch\n\nKris Devaux, the goalkeeper on Delaware's 2011 men's soccer team that won the CAA Tournament and then blanked Virginia 1-0 in a first-round NCAA stunner, has signed a pro contract. He's with Baerum SK in Norway's First Division. ... Seahawks cornerback Marcus Burley will be the eighth former Blue Hen on a Super Bowl team when Seattle takes on New England on Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. Burley, who was inactive in Seattle's first two playoff games, follows safety Mike Adams (Broncos, 2014); quarterback Joe Flacco (Ravens, 2013); center Gino Gradkowski (Ravens, 2013); tight end Ben Patrick (Cardinals, 2009); wide receiver Jamin Elliott (Patriots, 2004); quarterback Rich Gannon (Raiders, 2003); and defensive back Ivory Sully (Rams, 1980).\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

The fact CAA rival New Hampshire was selected over the Hens, who appeared to have an edge in many comparisons against the Wildcats, a team they did not play, made being rejected difficult to swallow.\n\n“We came here to do something extraordinary with our program and I think that we took a step forward and we certainly remain on track,” said Rocco, who moved to Delaware in December from CAA rival Richmond. “I think any time you are 7-4 coming out of this league you had a really good season.”\n\nFive final 2017 takeaways, with an eye toward at 2018:\n\nBetter, you bet\n\nThe curious losses at Towson and Villanova, where Delaware twice clearly didn't to rise to the occasion when the stakes were high, demonstrated the Blue Hens have considerable improvement to make.\n\nBut after a pair of 4-7 seasons, they certainly made headway.\n\n“Back-to-back 4-7s. We flipped it, you know, 7-4,” Rocco said. “Good start.\n\n“Could have been great if we were practicing [Monday]. If we’re practicing [Monday] this would have been a great year and nobody would dispute that.”\n\nIt was still a good year, more in line with traditional UD standards.\n\nImprovement at QB a must\n\nThe switch from third-year starter Joe Walker to Appalachian State transfer J.P. Caruso at quarterback made Delaware better, especially when Walker’s considerable skills were put to innovative use in various formations with him at quarterback, wide receiver and in the backfield.\n\nHis 165 all-purpose yards at Maine were among the more memorable UD individual performances in recent years. Coaches should have fun over the next nine months dreaming up clever ways to unleash Walker next year.\n\nBut the fact is, Delaware has to be much better at the quarterback position after ranking last in the CAA in passing offense for the third straight year (124.5 yards per game). Among the 12 CAA teams, Delaware was also 11th in completion percentage (51.3) and 10th in pass efficiency (108.7).\n\nCaruso and Walker will be seniors. They’ll be joined by Pat Kehoe, who has appeared in one game, Smyrna High grad Nolan Henderson, who redshirted as a freshman, and incoming recruit Anthony Paoletti. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Marple Newtown senior has broken Delaware County (Pa.) passing records.\n\n“It will start with competition, player evaluation and then player development,” Rocco said. “I do think we will have more options moving forward, obviously J.P., with Kehoe and with Nolan just to name three, and then Joe.\n\n“I think we’ll need to work to define what we need to do offensively a little bit more. I think Matt [Simon, offensive coordinator] did a good job this year managing what we had and where we were. We know we have to get better. He knows we have to get better.”\n\nThe 6-foot, 170-pound Henderson ran the scout team to rave reviews, with one defensive starter telling The News Journal, “He was one of the best quarterbacks we faced.”.\n\n“He can make all the throws,” Rocco said. “He’s quick. He’s athletic. He’s got a high football IQ. I believe he will make a legitimate push. I think he will make significant improvement. We gotta get him bigger. We gotta get him stronger.”\n\nAs for the offense as a whole, Delaware returns its top three rushers – Kani Kane (594 yards), Kareem Williams (469) and Walker (276), plus promising freshman Khory Spruill (183) – and most of the top receivers, including Jamie Jarmon (327).\n\n“There’s no doubt we’re going to need to be more efficient offensively,” Rocco said. “Too many three-and-outs. Too many punts [69, tied for first in CAA]. Too much stress on the defense.”\n\nStarting line\n\nDelaware’s offensive line, despite being a highly regarded veteran unit, sometimes didn’t perform up to expectations this season, a suggestion Rocco does not dispute.\n\n“When we were at our best, what we were doing was we were running the ball behind that offensive line,” Rocco said. “I had enough glimpses of what I think it can look like and that’s where I want it to start, and if you’re building your passing game off of that then we obviously have an opportunity to be a much more explosive football team.”\n\nTwo starters graduate – center Brody Kern and tackle Jake Trump. Returning with starting experience are guards Connor Lutz and Steve Robinson, tackle Jethro Pepe and Noah Beh, who played both.\n\n“We had a lot of candidates in there and a couple redshirt players in our offensive line this year that we really think are gonna be good players,” Rocco said. “I think that could be a solid group.”\n\nSturdy again\n\nDelaware should be very strong on defense again next year, led by the return of All-American candidates Troy Reeder and Nasir Adderly, especially with Rocco saying Monday that All-CAA inside linebacker Charles Bell has been granted a waiver to return for a fifth year.\n\nBell suffered a fracture in his back in the fourth game of the season against James Madison.\n\nThe biggest question mark, and an area the Hens could likely benefit most from a transfer, is up front.\n\nDelaware must replace the starting defensive line of Bilal Nichols, Blaine Woodson and John Nassib, which is no easy task. It should get back Cam Kitchen, who started the first four games at defensive end before suffering a foot injury requiring season-ending surgery. Sal Mauro and Dominick Covatto, who showed promise as a true freshman, join him.\n\nOutside linebacker Anthony Jackson and Jalen Kindle, who was splendid stepping in for the injured Bell, are the only other starting seniors to depart.\n\nBuilding depth will be paramount.\n\n“We wore down a little bit defensively there, maybe in our last game,” Rocco said.\n\nAppealing prospects\n\nDelaware has received verbal commitments from at least 11 Class of 2018 high school recruits who’ll be permitted to make that official during the new early Dec. 20-22 signing period.\n\nSome continue to be wooed by other schools, with Smyrna running back Will Knight, in particular, drawing enough FBS interest to make many feel he could be swayed elsewhere.\n\nIn all, Rocco hopes so have a class of roughly 16 by the final February signing.\n\n“I will always be open to and in search of transfer candidates that can come in here and offer success, relief, production to our football team,” he added. “I’ve always been a guy that believes in the reality that we need everybody and you need depth and you need multiple options at a lot of positions to be able march through into November.”\n\nCaruso, Penn State transfer Beh, and Kane, who spent two years at Lackawanna College, were three recent additions who fit that description. Expect more.\n\nWhile Delaware’s record NCAA playoff drought, now up to seven years, continued, there’s no doubt progress was made, despite the late-season opportunities it squandered.\n\n“I’m very excited about our future,” Rocco said.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Culprits have included the lack of a consistently reliable running attack, inefficient execution, penalties and an undependable kicking game.\n\nThe Blue Hens have scored on just 20 of their 31 red-zone visits, getting 19 touchdowns and only one field goal. That 64.5-percent rate is worst in the Colonial Athletic Association.\n\n“I just think it comes down to everybody on the field has to execute,” UD guard Stevon Brown said Monday. “ . . . Everyone needs to do their job well and I think we need to just keep being consistent when we go down there.”\n\nDIFFICULT DAY:QB Henderson plays but Blue Hens not up to the task in CAA loss at Elon\n\nSaturday’s 27-7 loss at Elon, where Delaware again failed to seize opportunities, dropped the Hens to 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the CAA. They slipped six spots to 18th in the Stats Perform FCS national media poll Top 25 Monday.\n\nFirst-year Colonial member Monmouth (4-5, 2-4) visits Delaware Stadium on Saturday at 1 p.m. That game matches a Monmouth offense that’s No. 1 in the CAA in yards (480.9) and points (39.9) per game against a Delaware defense allowing the fewest yards (265.6) and points (13.9).\n\nBut the Monmouth defense has struggled, giving up a CAA-worst 445.6 yards per game. The Blue Hens will hope to capitalize while being better at finishing their possessions with points.\n\nA multitude of mistakes, misfortune and malfunctions have characterized Delaware’s red-zone struggles.\n\nThe offense installed by first-year coach Ryan Carty and his staff is aimed at creating space in which players can get free to gain yards. But when there is less space, inside the 20, the Blue Hens have struggled to get the needed yards and, therefore, the necessary points.\n\nThe clearest evidence is this: On the final series of downs during Delaware’s 11 scoreless red-zone trips this season, the Blue Hens have completed just 2 of 17 passes for 6 yards with two interceptions.\n\nCAA STANDINGS: UNH alone at the top\n\nDelaware quarterbacks have also been sacked six times for minus-42 during those series, with two also resulting in lost fumbles.\n\nRunning the football hasn’t been a trustworthy option either. Delaware has gained just 19 yards on 10 carries on those series with three gains of four yards or more.\n\nThree of those 11 have ended with missed field goals – a 39-yarder by Brandon Ratcliffe at Navy, a 47-yarder by Andrew MacMillan against Towson and Garrett Bennion’s 28-yarder against Morgan State. The one against Towson came after a holding call actually erased a touchdown, with a sack pushing Delaware farther back.\n\nA penalty also undermined Delaware on Saturday, when it had first-and-10 at the Elon 17 before a sack for minus-3 yards and two incomplete passes. On the second, Carty was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after questioning why what he felt was a roughing-the-passer infraction wasn’t called after Nolan Henderson was hit along the Elon sideline.\n\n“That’s on me,” Carty said.\n\nWALK-ON WONDER:Diligence, determination elevate walk-on Buckman among top Delaware receivers\n\nHenderson, a dangerous runner, was playing with his injured left shoulder in a harness Saturday so his opportunities to carry the ball were limited in an effort to curtail potential contact.\n\nCarty did agree that a more effective running game would likely boost the Blue Hens’ red-zone success. Delaware’s 132.1 yards per game ranks 10th in the CAA and its 4.0 yards per carry is tied for eighth.\n\n“The thing that kinda helps you is being able to make people miss in open space,” Carty said. “ . . . A couple of run plays we did have down there ended up being one-on-ones and we didn’t make them miss Saturday. That’s something that we’ve talked about, we have to make sure we win those. It’s not acceptable. It’s not something we can say, ‘Oh, they made the play.’\n\n“We have to make the play when it’s a one-on-one on defense, which we didn’t do the other day. And we have to make the play on offense when it’s a one-on-one and we didn’t do that the other day. That’s what it comes down to.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus will air.\n\nVictory would likely sew up a postseason berth for the Blue Hens. A defeat would drop 17th-ranked Delaware into fifth or even sixth place depending on what happens in other league games and imperil the Hens’ postseason hopes.\n\nA season-opening win over FCS Navy, which takes a 3-6 record against Notre Dame this week, certainly boosts Delaware’s chances. The Blue Hens close the regular season Nov. 19 at Villanova, which is 5-4 after a 27-3 loss to Towson Saturday.\n\nATHLETIC UPGRADES?:University of Delaware is growing. Here's what president Assanis says is next\n\nThe 24-team FCS playoff field will be announced the next day. The only time more than four Colonial teams qualified was 2018, when Delaware was among six.\n\n“It’s really just this Saturday and this Saturday only,” Delaware wide receiver Jourdan Townsend said of how he and teammates view the situation. “We can’t look into the future because you can’t get to the future if you don’t live in the present. We’re just taking it week by week.”\n\nNo. 12-ranked Richmond handed New Hampshire its first league defeat Saturday, scoring the game’s first 24 points and hanging on for a 40-34 win.\n\n“They’re a really good team and so are we, so it’s gonna be a good game,” Townsend added.\n\nThe pressure that comes from playing with such high stakes against a high-caliber foe “is a privilege,” Delaware coach Ryan Carty said, and one he expects the Blue Hens to embrace.\n\n“Hopefully we understand that it’s a big game because it’s the next game,” Carty said, “because we came to this university to play in meaningful November games. We’re in one and it’s pretty awesome that we get a chance to be in situations like this.”\n\nDOMINANT WIN:Blue Hens make important progress in CAA football rout of Monmouth\n\nAfter limiting one of the CAA’s most potent offenses to two touchdowns Saturday, Delaware’s defense has another tough test Saturday.\n\nThe Blue Hens have given up league lows of 273 yards and 14.2 points per game. Richmond arrives having averaged 32 points and 438 yards per game, with a passing offense that’s No. 1 in the CAA with 290.2 yards per game.\n\nSpiders quarterback Reece Udinski, who sparked VMI to the 2021 spring FCS playoffs and played at Maryland last fall, leads the CAA with 2,574 passing yards keyed by an almost-preposterous 76.2 completion percentage. His 22 TD passes are topped only by Nolan Henderson’s 25 for Delaware in the CAA.\n\nIt’ll be quite a challenge for a Blue Hens unit that is first against the pass in the CAA, allowing a league-low 116.9 air yards per game.\n\n“I’d say what makes us so good in pass defense is the brotherhood we kinda have in the [defensive backs],” said red-shirt freshman safety Ty Davis. “ … For this week, kinda keep on going with that. Doing what we know, doing our fundamentals right, not having to stress too much or press too much. Just doing our job and getting the job done, staying on our man and covering well.”\n\nDelaware trounced Monmouth 49-17 on Saturday at Delaware Stadium. The 49 points were the Hens’ most since the 56-14 win over Delaware State in the 2016 season opener.\n\nHenderson was named CAA Offensive Player of the week after completing 22 of 28 passes for 323 yards and five touchdowns. The Smyrna High grad became the first UD quarterback to throw five TD passes in a game twice. He also ran 2 yards for a TD.\n\nCarty and Richmond coach Russ Huesman agreed the two teams are similar in having powerful, pass-oriented offenses and strong defenses. Delaware and Richmond are 1-2 in the CAA in scoring and total defense.\n\n“Hopefully we can just go out there and keep doing what we’ve been doing,” Carty said. “Practice really hard, try to play as fundamentally sound as possible and match the intensity, if not have more intensity, than whatever opponent we play.”\n\nHen scratch\n\nDelaware linebacker Johnny Buchanan still leads FCS in tackles (112) and tackles per game (12.4). … Blue Hen Touchdown Club MVPs from the Monmouth game were Henderson (offense), Chase McGowan (defense) and Dillon Trainer (special teams). … Quarterbacks coach Sean Goldrich and lacrosse coach Ben DeLuca will speak at Friday’s weekly Blue Hen Touchdown Club luncheon at noon at the Carpenter Center.
